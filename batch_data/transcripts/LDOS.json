Price - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division Richard Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the SAIC First Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, Monday, June 3, 2013. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Paul Levi, SAIC's Senior VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Paul E. Levi: Thank you, Vince, and good afternoon. I'd like to welcome you to our first quarter fiscal year 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me today are John Jumper, our Chairman and CEO; Stu Shea, our COO; and Mark Sopp, our CFO; and other members of our leadership team as well. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding the company and our expectations about its future financial and operating performance. These statements are subject to a number of risks that could cause actual events to differ materially, and I'll refer you to our SEC filings for a discussion of these risks. In addition, the statements represent our views as of today. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our views to change. We may elect to update the forward-looking statements at some point in the future, but we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. I would now like to turn the call over to John Jumper, our Chairman and CEO. John P. Jumper: Thank you, Paul, and welcome, everyone. The first quarter of 2014 was relatively in line with our expectations with revenues of $2.71 billion for the quarter, down slightly to the prior year quarter. This represents an internal revenue decline of 4%, primarily due to the loss of the large DGS contract and ramp down on the war-related OCO work on a JLI contract, which together reduced our revenues by more than $100 million. The revenue performance also reflects the impact of sequestration, which is driving delayed decisions and imposing significant fear and caution throughout the contracting process. Operating income was lower than the prior year, due mainly to $40 million of costs for the separation and preparation of 2 stand-alone companies, and our operating cash flow was negatively impacted by the earlier-than-expected discontinuance of an accelerated payment program by the government. Having said that, our performance was mostly as we expected and our previous guidance anticipated many of the current challenges. Today, we are reaffirming the guidance that we outlined in our March call. Looking forward, uncertainty over funds -- over funding remains, but there is still little that our customers can tell us about what to expect and over what period of time. I, along with other CEOs in this space, have been engaged with leadership of the Pentagon who, I must say, have gone out of their way to conduct frequent meetings with industry leadership. Along with others, I have emphasized the need to work the necessary fiscal discipline in a more reasonable way with debate and compromise rather than mindless across-the-board cuts. At SAIC, we are proactively responding and taking the necessary steps to manage the business in the current difficult environment. Our $350 million cost-reduction plan is progressing well and we continue to adjust our infrastructure to ensure that we have the right-sized business to address our revenue base. Our strong balance sheet has and will effectively support our ongoing development of the company. We remain thoughtful about how we deploy our capital, as evidenced by the special dividend that will be paid out on June 28. As always, we approach all of our capital deployment efforts with a view toward maximizing value for our shareholders. Our planned separation is progressing on schedule and will yield 2 cost-conscious, high-performance companies that focus on driving value to our shareholders. We're still operating as one company and focused on making our plan for the year. However, we are in a transition year and incurring significant cost to prepare for the companies to be successful following separation. We are pleased to announce a new National Security Solutions leader, Lou Von Thaer, who Stu will discuss in his section. Lou brings a career of experience and talent to that sector, and we are delighted to welcome him. Also, we have John Sweeney on the call with us today, and he'll be heading up Leidos Investor Relations efforts. The leadership team for both companies is substantially in place. Now I'll turn this over to our COO, Stu Shea, who will discuss business performance. K. Stuart Shea : Thanks, John. Let me first comment on the appointment of Lou Von Thaer as our new President of the National Security Sector. Lou has the benefit of coming into an organization that has been expertly led by acting President John Thomas. Over the past 6 months, John has done an exceptional job shaping, streamlining and focusing that sector for the future. This includes the establishment of a much improved sharing of key-enabling technologies such as Big Data analytics and cybersecurity across our full portfolio, with specific focus on bringing these solutions to the Health and Engineering Sector. This is a key building block in the future success of Leidos. In addition, John's energy at market positioning and core strategic focus areas of maritime ISR and cybersecurity lay the groundwork for Lou's day 1 efforts. Lou brings to legacy SAIC and future Leidos, a strong background in both these key areas. As an example, Lou served as a cochair of the recent Defense Science Board Task Force on Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat. Combining his firsthand knowledge of the cyber threat with our existing market leadership in the cyber community will be a powerful combination for our shareholders. I look forward to Lou's arrival later this week to begin that process. Let me now bring you up to speed on our separation of SAIC. Some of you may have been tracking our progress this quarter through our initial and updated Form 10 submissions with the SEC. Based upon that dialogue, as well as with other regulatory organizations, we believe there are no significant issues that would affect our planned separation. From a programmatic perspective, most of the difficult internal decisions have been made on cost efficiencies, capital allocations, staffing, facilities, et cetera, and we are nearing completion of all the various internal agreements to separate into 2 companies. We are right now in the separation part of the program we call soft spin. Over the past quarter, we reorganized legacy SAIC into the future state of the 2 new companies, so the leadership teams could start working together prior to the formal hard spin date. This will lower operational risk of the separation without impairing current SAIC performance. When we made the separation announcement last August, we said that we would complete the separation during the second half of the 2013 calendar year. I am pleased to report that the separation could happen as early as August. Assuming we remain on this schedule, we are planning for investor events and additional activities, such as ringing the bell at the New York Stock Exchange to celebrate the launch of 2 new companies. Before the planned separation, we intend to hold investor conferences for both Leidos and new SAIC, where each management team will present details about their respective companies' current operations and future plans. These conferences for institutional investors and analysts are planned to be held in New York on July 17 for Leidos and July 18 for future SAIC, and more specifics will be announced soon. This is, of course, all subject to the final regulatory approvals, as well as around readiness reviews and board approval that will be held over the coming weeks. Moving now to real estate monetization. On May 3, we entered into an agreement for the sale and lease back of our McLean, Virginia headquarters campus, consisting of 4 office buildings of about 900,000 square feet, and the sale of adjacent land, 18 acres in all. The sale and lease back of our headquarters facility is expected to be completed in July of 2013, with the sale of the adjacent land to be completed over a 6-year period as part of a multiuse development plan to be approved by Fairfax County. The transactions that will be completed under the sale agreement are the result of our long-term real estate monetization strategy put in motion by our Board of Directors several years ago. Completing the sale of our headquarters facility is also another step that will help us to enable both Leidos and future SAIC to establish operational headquarters that are specific to their business needs. This is consistent with our approach to have successful, independent and world-class firms in the future following our planned separation. Moving now to our business development results. Net bookings totaled $1.3 billion in the first quarter and produced a book-to-bill ratio of 0.5. We ended the quarter with $16.5 billion in total backlog, $4.7 billion of which is funded. Compared with Q1 a year ago, this was a $700 million decrease in total backlog. As we expected, award decisions and the result in pace of bookings from our U.S. government customers slowed considerably in the quarter, reflecting the understandable reaction to the lack of sequestration guidance from government sources. This has been exacerbated by the inconsistency in how individual government agencies have been implementing that guidance. This is especially problematic in how these cuts are applied to every program, project and activity, or PPA in the budget, when there is significant variability in the size and mission criticality of these PPAs across various budget line items under the authorities, for example, of the Department of Defense, Intelligence Community, State Department and Department of Homeland Security. As John mentioned earlier, we are tightly integrated into the leadership discussions that are ongoing, and from an operational perspective, we continue to expand our pipeline and demonstrate the relevancy of our offerings. So despite a strong qualified pipeline of opportunities and a steady pace of submits, we did experience the same softness as others in our industry did on the pace of award decisions. Despite the slowness in awards, by the end of the quarter, we had over $24 billion in outstanding bids. That includes $13 billion in ID/IQ bids and about $11 billion in definite-delivery bids. As we are not seeing any significant increase in the cancellation of known new starts or outright terminations of contracts, we're optimistic that contract issuance will pick up as we move through the rest of the year. During the first quarter, we won 3 programs valued at more than $100 million each, including a significant modeling and simulation experimentation effort under the AMCOM EXPRESS ID/IQ. So far during the second quarter, we've added 2 more $100 million programs, including a program with Orange County, California, to provide IT managed services and solutions to agencies and departments within the county and a classified cyber intelligence program critical to our nation's security. Frankly, our performance against this goal was less than what we expected a year ago. And we attribute the decline to fewer decisions being made on all programs due to sequestration and future budget uncertainty. At this time, we have over 110 opportunities over $100 million in our pipeline, of which, 43 have already been submitted and are awaiting award. Over the years, as we have continued to expand our markets, we have experienced a very consistent win percentage on proposals. As we eliminate organizational conflict of interest, we will continue to expand our addressable market and fully anticipate our successful win rate will continue. We have continued to earn excellent win rates in Q1. Our overall total dollar win rate on opportunities was 58% with a 47% total dollar win rate on new business. When coupled with our very strong win rate on recompete bids, we are in a solid position for our upcoming pipeline. With that, let me now turn it over to Mark. Mark W. Sopp: Great. Thank you, Stu. I'd first like to call your attention to the supplemental financial information package that we've added to our website this quarter. This package will provide the investment community most of the pertinent highlights of our performance for the quarter in one place. This is part of our ongoing effort to provide transparency and clarity into the business. In addition, as Stu mentioned, we have reorganized the business to align to what will become new SAIC and Leidos. Specifically, starting this quarter, the Technical Services and Information Technology reporting segment will comprise the future SAIC, post-separation. And the National Security Solutions and the Health and Engineering reporting segments will together comprise Leidos. The operating segments now give investors a clearer view of the new SAIC and Leidos. With respect to our Q1 performance, there are 3 main points I want to convey. First, the consolidated numbers are down year-over-year on the main financial metrics, but there were discrete adverse items in revenue, margins and cash flows, which we believe are either temporary or recoverable and should be considered in the context of future performance. Second, we are in a transition year, as John said, where we are incurring substantial cost now to build 2 great companies, which will be more competitive and will have greater addressable markets in the future years. And third, notwithstanding the magnitude of dealing with sequestration and our separation preparation activities, we are so far on plan for the year and are reaffirming our guidance. Now let me cover some of the highlights as well as our forward guidance. With respect to forward guidance, let me first remind you that our guidance, as it did originally, assumes SAIC operates for full fiscal year '14 as one company, the one company as you know it today, but this guidance also include significant costs to prepare for and execute the separation transaction. So that's the baseline of our guidance. On top line, performance for the quarter, our government business contracted in Q1 but was partially offset by solid growth in our Health and Engineering business, which had significant commercial revenues that are not directly affected by reductions in government spending. As our plan and guidance contemplated, revenue contraction was significantly attributed to the ramp down of the DGS and JLI programs in our government sectors. The DGS program was assigned to the future SAIC business and is therefore reflected in the Technical Services and IT segment, whereas the JLI program was assigned to Leidos and is in the National Security Solutions segment. Both companies will, therefore, have to overcome contraction from these 2 programs over the next year. The tech services and IT segment had revenue contraction in Q1 of about 5%, virtually all of which was attributable to the ramp down of the DGS program. The National Security Solutions segment had revenue contraction of 9%, about 6% of which was attributed to the JLI program, with the remainder mostly being scope reductions related to the Middle East drawdown and various budget reductions that we have planned. And with respect to our increasingly important business outside of the government sector, our Health and Engineering business posted 9% growth, fueled, this quarter, by energy projects and security product revenues and ongoing growth in our electronic health records, consulting business. While we did see delays and uncertainties in new awards and in funding levels through the first quarter, we did not see any major unplanned impacts to existing programs associated with sequestration. What we do see is ongoing confidence that the mission-critical programs that we serve throughout the national security space must continue to operate and with our assistance. Given our experience in Q1, we are reaffirming our existing revenue guidance of $10.0 billion to $10.7 billion for the full year, which reflects all the signals we are getting from our customers plus some room for unknowns that we may confront. With respect to timing, we expect a meaningful falloff in revenue pace from Q1 to Q2, resulting from 2 less productive days and seeing the full impact of the ramp down of DGS and JLI. We then expect sequential growth in Q3 for more productive days, ramp up from recent and anticipated wins and continuing growth in our commercial area. Operating margin for Q1 was 5.2%, reflective of the transition year we are now in. Separation expenses diluted margins by roughly 120 basis points. In addition, profitability was adversely impacted by about $7 million in cost to build the infrastructures for the 2 companies. We still expect to incur, as announced last quarter, $140 million of nonrecurring expenses related to the separation, facilities' exit costs and the corporate move; no change to that. These expenses are expected to peak in Q2 as we near separation, and therefore expected to have a material impact to margin in Q2. Assuming the separation occurs when planned, these costs should ramp down quickly in Q3. In the first quarter, we also had net program write-downs, a couple of charges related to legal matters and government audits, few asset impairments and cost to integrate our 2 commercial electronic health records consulting businesses : Vitalize and maxIT. Our plan contemplates that these go away after this quarter. Earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.23 for Q1. This included a tax rate which was about 4 percentage points higher than what we project for the full year due to discrete nondeductible items. Our estimated tax rate for the full fiscal '14 is 32%, which is about 1.5% higher than our original expectation, or about $0.03 EPS impact for the year. This was due to the nondeductible items in Q1 and some slippage of planned favorable items to next year. With guidance for revenues remaining unchanged and the expectation of significantly improved operating margins in the second half, we are maintaining our EPS guidance for the year at $1.16 to $1.33 per share. For operating cash flow, as John mentioned, the first quarter was weaker than expected as the government ended an accelerated payment initiative, whereas this was originally planned to occur in Q3. This does not change our view for the full year and our guidance remains at, at least $450 million. Finally, let me just cover a few capital structure items. First, we amended our $750 million credit facility this quarter to address elements needed for the separation transaction, and while we were at it, we are incorporated several other favorable terms and also extended the maturity to 2017. Second, we successfully launched a capital-raising activity for new SAIC, where we plan to establish a conservative capital structure to include a $500 million, 5-year term loan and a $200 million 5-year revolving credit facility. We expect to close those arrangements in June and plan to fund the term loan just prior to separation. And third, as previously disclosed, we will be paying $1 per share special dividend on June 28 for shareholders of record, June 14. All 3 of these actions underscore the cash flow and liquidity strengths of the company, which will enable strategic flexibility and future capital deployments with a focus on creating value for our shareholders. Now back to John for his final remarks. John P. Jumper: Thanks, Mark. Let me sum up by saying that we remain confident in our plan, we understand and we're dealing with a combined turbulence of sequestration and the dynamics of separating our company and we have 40,000 remarkable employees dedicated to the future success of these 2 great companies. I'll now turn it back over to Paul to take your questions. Paul E. Levi: Thanks, John. Operator, we'll take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Ross Cowley - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : This is actually Ross Cowley in for Rob. I have 2 quick questions. On the first one, specifically looking at Health and Engineering, you had nice growth of around 25% there and the margin came down. Now I know you said in the 8-K that some of this was because of intangible asset amortization expenses. But is it possible to break out how much of the pressure is related to the spin and how much is related to things such as greater competition, et cetera? Mark W. Sopp: Well, Ross, this is Mark here. I did mention in my prepared remarks that the health businesses, we did make some steps to integrate the previous Vitalize acquisition, as well as the recent maxIT acquisition. And so that was pretty meaningful in the quarter and nonetheless, the right thing to do. On the engineering side, we had strong performance overall, I would say, and good energy or engineering products going out the door as well and also including -- give Joe a lot of credit, a healthy maintenance business was part of that, which has been very profitable for us. So a little bit of investment, very bullish on the long-term prospects of both growth and prosperity in that area. Ross Cowley - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay, great. That's very helpful. And just one more, is it possible to quantify the mix of cost plus versus fixed price contracts in each of the 2 new businesses, in Leidos and SAIC? Mark W. Sopp: Mark here. Give us a check into -- check that out. Yes, why don't we come back to that question in a moment? We have it for the consolidated business, of course, in the sectors. But we like to redo it for Leidos and new SAIC for your question. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bill Loomis with Stifel, Nicolaus. William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : By just staying on the engineering and health care side, Mark, can you give us kind of what the breakout is between the engineering and health care because if engineering was strong, organic growth 9% because I know the health care was growing at like 20% or so, but it seems like it might have slowed down in the quarter. Am I reading that right? Mark W. Sopp: The both -- both of our businesses were fairly equal in terms of growth rates this quarter. The commercial health was just south of 10% and engineering was similarly strong, obviously. So that's how it shook out this particular quarter. I still think we're seeing in some pause in the marketplace on the commercial health side as a result of the extension of the ICD 10 and Meaningful Use regulations that went from August 2013 to August 2014, and also the 2% haircut to Medicare reimbursements via sequestration might also be attributing to some of the pause. But nonetheless, the regulations are in place. We think the industry is compelled to invest in modernizing its IT and its EHR implementations accordingly. So it might be a short-term pause but nonetheless, very bullish on the outcome for this year and beyond. William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : And then just in that, on the national [ph] , can you tell us since you put the MRAP business in that, which will be in Leidos, how much of that segment now would be either -- would be both Army and then specifically OCO work, so we understand when it goes to Leidos what it would be for that firm? Mark W. Sopp: Bill, we'll have to work on that one. We don't have that on our fingertips. When we have our Investor Days in July, I think we'll provide plenty of color on the composition and revenue stratifications of the businesses, so I think it's best to hold off until then. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies & Company. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division : So just on the book-to-bill, obviously, not surprising to see sequestration taking its toll on everyone in the industry. But just give us a sense of what your latest expectations would be for full-year fiscal '14 on book-to-bill based on what you're seeing in the pipeline here? K. Stuart Shea : Jason, this is Stu. As you know, book-to-bill ratio varies considerably on timing of new orders and it can fluctuate meaningfully quarter-by-quarter. As you mentioned, we're seeing the same thing everybody else is in terms of customer change, in terms of their buying habits. Our goal is always to get towards 1 and above 1.0. It's a tough uphill battle this year right now. What we're seeing, though, is a little bit of a change in how customers are funding activities. They're funding shorter increments and smaller funding levels, which of course, will have less of a predictive nature on how that converts to revenues in the future. So we're taking a hard look at that, trying to really understand the nature because we're seeing a pretty significant change in that funding style. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division : Right, right. Okay, understood. And just thinking about the full-year EPS guidance, the reiterations there, can completely appreciate that and the second half margins should be meaningfully better because as you described the transition expenses should bleed off pretty quickly. But based on where you're at right now, I mean, should we be thinking about the lower end being more likely? Mark W. Sopp: Jason, I don't want to comment on the point in the range where we will be. We're in the range, we're reaffirming that. I would point out that we see in quarters 2 through 4, a few things improving for us. We have made a number of cost reductions this quarter and last quarter. The full impact of those cost reductions will benefit the P&L in Q2 and beyond in the core of the business and in the overheads. We do expect that our fee performance across the business on a number of dimensions and actually improve the rate recovery from some of the cost we had in Q1, helping out. So we do expect margins to improve, not only from the going away of the separation expenses, but fundamentally in the business throughout that will drive much of the performance you see and implicit in our guidance assumptions. And on the EPS side, I'll also point out as I tried to in my remarks, that the tax rate was 36% of the first quarter. It's going to be more toward 30% flat for the remaining 3 quarters, and that will have quite a bit of benefit to the EPS in Q2 through 4 as well. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division : Okay, makes sense. And then just last for me. Any change in your projected revenue or cost synergies from the split? Mark W. Sopp: None at all. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr from Cowen and Company. Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : So given that we have a new lineup of businesses that you have now defined, could you give us some numbers in terms of how these 3 businesses sorted out in terms of revenues and operating profits in fiscal '13, since that's behind us? Mark W. Sopp: Cai, we will be providing that not at this time, but either in conjunction with our investor conference that we mentioned in July, possibly after that. But we're going to shoot for July to provide those numbers, not only for the Q1 of last year but, of course, if you want you're probably asking for Q2, 3 and 4 of last year and well, we just completed that. Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Well, just give us the full year. I mean, just the problem is Health looks quite a bit smaller than I would've guessed. I don't know where other people were but -- so if we have a rough sense in terms of where the revenues were, we can have a rough sense of how last year modeled out and basically with some intelligence, hopefully, can kind of look forward. But if we don't have any idea of the size of the 3 businesses or just a fairly vague idea, it's a lot more difficult. Mark W. Sopp: Understand the difficulty. We have expended a lot of effort to do the carveouts, expended a lot of effort to restructure the business and we'll be prepared to provide the full prior year numbers in the July timeframe, possibly slip into August. There's just a lot of stuff to do in preparation of the separation and we just don't have those other quarters at this time, Cai. Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then a second one, as you look at the -- you mentioned, Mark, lot of things in addition to those -- the $9 million you called out. You mentioned other kind of adjustments, higher intangibles. Maybe you could walk us through the major other items that have not already been laid out in the quarter? Mark W. Sopp: I trust you are -- when you say \"other\" you mean, in addition to what we posted on the website? Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Correct, correct. Mark W. Sopp: Right, well, I mentioned we did make some investments in our commercial health area. Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : And so when you say investments, like how big and... Mark W. Sopp: We haven't quantified them there. There is a few million of integration expenses to prepare our Commercial business for the long term. We also have started incurring the synergy costs in our -- in the building of our 2 businesses that will be more than offset by cost reductions that we have already made decisions on, but won't really start paying off until Q2 through Q4. And we had some program write-downs that were disclosed in the -- will be disclosed in the Q and the earnings release that are not itemized in the supplemental materials. It's about a year-over-year $8 million swing that had a pretty meaningful impact on Q1 as well. Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay, great. And the last one, your -- while your book-to-bill was light as everyone else's was, your funding to sales actually held up a little bit better. Stu, could you hazard a guess in terms of where the funding to sales for the year might be? K. Stuart Shea : Well, let me think about that for a second, Cai. Mark W. Sopp: I think it's reasonable to expect, Cai, that our funded backlog will remain 5 months, maybe 6 months of forward revenue in the environment we see at each quarter end, which has previously been higher than that, 6, 7, even 8 sometimes, but in this environment, as was mentioned, it's coming out in smaller pieces. So we expect a lower number but nonetheless, indicative of the environment and at this point, not changing our view with respect to the ultimate revenue outcome. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Mark, just to sort of -- to make sure I'm on the same page, the $9 million of net items that you delineated on Slide 6, that's all in the corporate line? Or is it embedded [ph] ... Mark W. Sopp: No, that is not -- the impairments are in the appropriate segments. Everything else is in the corporate line. Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : So NSS is the $4 million and the other $3 million are in corporate? Mark W. Sopp: That's correct. Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And then so -- and then just to make sure I understand what you said, you said $140 million refers to the $33 million of the separation transaction cost in the quarter. So that will be $140 million in total, $33 million was Q1 and the peak number is in Q2? Mark W. Sopp: Correct. Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And then on the segment margins, I mean, it's -- given a number of investments that here, there were a number of investments that you delineated earlier that are one-off, just when you take a step back and you look at the margin profile for the company, I mean have things weakened over the last 12 months or is this just all noise? It's really tough to get a great sense of that. Mark W. Sopp: It is and we'll work on making that more apparent to you. But I would say that there is margin erosion from a pure percentage perspective related to the tightening pricing environment. And it's a meaningful number of basis points. I don't think it's a full percentage, but I think it's a meaningful number of basis points, Joe, for tighter bids, as well as just the replacement of programs that previously were at attractive margins for us, BCTM worked itself out, JLI and DGS were pretty good programs from a profitability perspective. And they're either going away or replaced by other programs that don't quite have the margin profile. So the lion's share are the investments and costs we're incurring to prepare for separation. The way out of this in terms of long-term plan is, of course, complete Gemini successfully and focus on driving organic growth on the core business, but also the -- tapping into the incremental addressable market, freed up from separation and a much less stressful OCI situation for us. We've got to continue to grow our Commercial business and also improve our overall product profitability, so those are high priority items. And of course, execute the cost reductions that we've mentioned, which will benefit all 3 sectors. So that's where we're at as a roadmap and we'll provide more color on that in July. Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. Just one more on corporate, if I might. Not to dwell on that too much, but -- so if -- it's $5 million of items in there, net, plus the $33 million of separations, that's $38 million. You were at $46 million of total expense, so $8 million besides those items. Is that -- what's the run rate of that line item x the items? Mark W. Sopp: Well, there's stock option expense in there. There are the unallowable cost of the enterprise outside of the sectors. You can probably imagine what those are. So those are in there and we have our corporate move is in there, which will be for one more quarter. Those are the major elements there. Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay, and then one more and I'll move on. I'll turn it over. The interest in your EPS guidance, are there any positive one-time items that you're contemplating or is it just -- is there anything else in there that we haven't really discussed that's going to enable you to get to your range? Mark W. Sopp: Good question, the answer is no. We don't have any buybacks, we don't have real estate gains. It's all pure operations improvement. The phaseout of the separation expenses and the improvement in the tax rate that I mentioned earlier. Operator : Our next question is from the line of George Price with BB&T Capital Markets. George A. Price - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : A number of them have already been asked thus far, but a couple on, I guess, the broader environment. First, I just wanted to be clear, have you seen any change, I guess, even though in the past couple of months in terms of the pace of award decisions, given sequestration? I mean, some have talked about, actually on the other side of the CR and the appropriations where we got them, and the fact that we finally saw the sequester date come and go that the activity had actually started to pick up a little bit. I guess, the tone of how you characterize the environment struck me as maybe a little bit of a step-back possibly. Am I reading too much into that? Have you seen any dramatic changes, I guess, over the last couple of months? K. Stuart Shea : George, this is Stu. I guess the biggest thing we're seeing is a slowness in the award decisions. That's what I try to convey in my part of the dialogue. We're just seeing a lot of indecision. We're not seeing any dramatic shift in terms of program terminations, cancellations, reductions, but we are seeing an absolute slowness in the award decisions. One of the things we talked about last quarter was this idea of LPTA and the impact on the business. Again, we're not seeing any dramatic across-the-board cuts on pricing and movement in a significant way into LPTA kind of awards, but we are seeing customers shifting their decision towards more low price. And of course, as we mentioned in the past, being able to define technically acceptable is always a challenge. So there's always broad kind of activities happening, slowness in decisions, more towards low price, but nothing that stands out as significant in terms of dramatic shifts over what's really been happening in an evolutionary fashion over the last couple of quarters. George A. Price - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay, okay. And then one sort of one on the commercial market side, piggybacking onto an earlier question. In terms of health care and energy, I was wondering what kind of growth you expect to see from those areas in fiscal '14? I think you mentioned there both year-over-year in the quarter we're running at about 10%. Is that about what you expect going forward? Do the comps come down a little bit more? Anything you'd offer there would be great. Mark W. Sopp: The organic growth that we have slated for the HE segment, Health and Engineering segment, is in the low-single digits for fiscal '14. Commercial health being well above that, but we've got environmental business in there and the products business that has nice profit characteristics, but I'm not seeing the growth there this year. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Rick Eskelsen with Wells Fargo Securities. Richard Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Just the first one is going back to the awards expectations. Do you think that there will be the normal seasonal flush in the government's fiscal fourth quarter? And is it possible that it could be even higher than normal? And do you get the sense that clients held back maybe more than I should have ahead of the sequestration? K. Stuart Shea : I think that's wishful thinking. And we all have discussed it. I think you're going to see a clearly end of fiscal year flush probably not dissimilar from what you've seen in previous years. But there's a lot of pent-up dollars that are not being expended, and you could see a dramatic change. We're not counting on it. We're counting on a very traditional year-end flush of funding. Richard Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : That's very helpful. Then just the next one is you talked about some higher margin programs running off with pricing getting tighter and maybe an evolutionary shift towards LPTA. I mean, any sense for where we are in the pendulum swing of moving away from best value towards LPTA and when you might see that kind of mindset reverse in your government clients? John P. Jumper: Let me -- this is John. Let me start with that and Stu can chime in. We've been through these cycles before. And as Stu pointed out, there's really not a lot of formal LPTA. We talk a lot about LPTA, but there's not that many formally defined as LPTA. We're just seeing the behavior more reflect price than you would expect. But these cycles have changed because, again, it all comes down to what's technically acceptable and the more that you get some contractors that are having more difficulty performing, the more you see the pendulum swing back the other way. So there's so much other uncertainty out there right now, it's hard to predict what that cycle might be, but we have seen this before. K. Stuart Shea : Yes, if you go back a couple of weeks ago and you think about the big shift from cost reimbursable contracts to fixed-price contracts, it was the way to go because they -- you could set a limit and move in that direction. We saw a big shift in some parts of our business. We're now, in some parts of our business, in just the opposite. We're going from big fix-priced programs that were very successful to cost reimbursable contracts. And of course, the margin on the cost reimbursable contracts, if you execute the fix-priced version very well, are not as favorable on the cost reimbursable ones. So that's one of the changes we're seeing as well. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Levi for any closing remarks. Paul E. Levi: We have -- thank you very much. I'd like to thank you all for your interest in SAIC and participating in the call today. I wish everybody a good evening. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, sir.

Welcome to the SAIC Fiscal Year 2014 Q2 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, September 4, 2013. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paul Levi. Please go ahead, sir. Paul E. Levi: Thank you, George. And good morning. I would like to welcome you to our Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are John Jumper, our Chairman and CEO; Stu Shea, our COO; and Mark Sopp, our CFO; and other members of our leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding the company and our expectations about its future financial and operating performance. These statements are subject to a number of risks that could cause actual events to differ materially, and I refer you to our SEC filings for a discussion of these risks. In addition, the statements represent our views as of today. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our views to change. We may elect to update the forward-looking statements at some point in the future, but we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. I would now like to turn the call over to John Jumper, our Chairman and CEO. John P. Jumper: Thank you, Paul. And welcome, everyone. In the second quarter, our performance was impacted by a number of discrete items. These included costs related to the planned separation of SAIC into 2 companies, 4 underperforming programs, 2 fixed-price foreign development contracts, a biomass plant construction contract and an IT services contract with a state and local customer; and a noncash intangible impairment of Reveal Imaging Technologies, a provider of threat-detection products and services that we acquired in August 2010. Looking at the results for the quarter. Revenues were $2.5 billion, down 15% year-over-year on an internal basis. This was in line with our expectations given previously announced contract reductions. The anticipated drawdown of Joint Logistics Integration, or JLI, reduced revenues by $64 million. As you know, JLI is directly related to the U.S. Military draw -- withdrawal from Southwest Asia. Revenue was further reduced by the loss of that DISN Global Solutions or DGS contract a year ago, an $85 million impact. Together, these 2 items account for almost half of the internal year-over-year decline. The remainder of the revenue decline was primarily driven by the impact of sequestration, which reduced the testing levels on current contracts, lowering the levels of award, resulting in delayed decisions and imposing significant caution throughout the contracting process. Operating income was lower than the prior year, significantly impacted by the cost of the separation and the discrete items discussed above. Despite all of this, our operating cash flow was strong for the quarter at $217 million, in line with our expectations and demonstrating the underlying resiliency of our company, even in difficult times. While we used all of the available information to factor in the full impact of sequestration in our earlier guidance this year, we need to be even more cautious based on our current outlook for the second half. Recent wins are in protests. Award decisions are being increasingly delayed. And the spillover effects of government spending cuts to our commercial health business, though we believe temporary, has been factored into our updated expectations. As a result and in light of our first half performance, we're reducing our fiscal 2014 guidance today. Mark will outline the details later in his remarks. I should note that, after the quarter closed, the company has had some notable wins of new business opportunities. Specifically, we were the only contractor awarded the NASA Human Health and Performance contract, an ID/IQ single-award value of $1.8 billion. We also won a new engineering program with LSB Industries for over $100 million, with a potential of additional business for this client. These contract wins indicate that our pipeline remains strong and we continue to win in the marketplace. We're excited about moving closer to accomplishing our separation. I'd like to point out that the separation gave us an opportunity to redesign the cost and rate structure of both companies, the benefit of which will be more visible as we complete this split and shed the burden of our separation and transition costs this year. Now I'd like to turn the microphone over to our COO, Stu Shea. K. Stuart Shea : Thanks, John. And good morning, everyone. For the next few minutes, I'd like to share with you how we are dealing with several operational matters that affected our performance this past quarter, discuss a little bit about the lessons we learned and highlight to you how we are going to better mitigate similar risks like this into the future. With roughly 9,000 contracts in SAIC today, we have an excellent track record of strong program performance. One of the many benefits of the separation of SAIC and Leidos is that we got an opportunity to take a deep look at where every one of these programs were being executed within the company. In preparation for the separation, every contract was repositioned to where it best fit in the new structure, not necessarily leaving them in the part of the company that won or were executing the contract. To that end, the movement of the contracts to their new locations drew additional focus to ensure that we have the right solutions and execution teams involved to deliver on our commitments. As part of that additional focus, there were 2 programs that required additional technical effort. These 2 programs are on our watch list. And as we continue to develop and testing during the second quarter, we identified performance issues that required technical redesign and an associated schedule slip. Of the 4 underperforming programs that John mentioned, all were fixed-price development contracts that shared some common attributes. First, these programs were all with new customers outside of our core markets. 2 of the efforts were delivered in foreign countries, another with a state and local customer and a fourth with a commercial power plant developer. In each case, there were some challenges translating the project requirements to appropriate solutions by the project team and only became apparent as the programs were being executed, designed and tested. In addition, on 2 of the contracts, the project teams themselves were not the best suited in the company to execute the programs. There were others in the company that were better suited to have taken on these efforts because of their core skill sets and track record of performance on similar efforts. The combination of these 2 factors ultimately resulted in us identifying the program issues that translated to an increase in costs. We ultimately took write-downs as our estimates changed to accommodate these impacts. Subsequently, we initiated a review of all programs across the company that shared similar attributes. We believe we have better matched the difficult programs with the appropriate teams to best steer these programs to conclusion. In addition, we have scrubbed our business development pipeline to limit our exposure in programs such as these. These actions have addressed the current portfolio, but we've also taken a hard look at the composition of new SAIC and Leidos going forward and what decisions we can make to ensure we are more effective going forward. To that end, we've made some changes to our individual operating philosophies, and these will roll out over the coming quarters. First, I can assure you that we are both going to stay laser focused on our core businesses, and within those businesses, we will choose carefully what type of contracts we will take on. We will also be more active in the divestiture of nonstrategic or nonperforming businesses. We have placed into discontinued operation one line of business in Q2, and we're evaluating the potential exit from a few select areas in the second half of this fiscal year. We will balance our emphasis on top line growth, with a focus on year-over-year improvement of economic profit. Our key measures of success and incentives will be structured to drive year-over-year profit growth and capital efficiency. We will expand our culture of continuous improvement in operational efficiencies to continue to drive costs out of our SG&A. Both companies will have ongoing programs to continue to drive down our wrap rates through improved competitiveness. We have achieved significant reduction in our wrap rates over the past year but are targeting even more over the coming year. And finally, we will be much more focused on using our capital to benefit our shareholders. We do not plan to build excess cash on our balance sheets going forward and we expect to return significant value to our shareholders. Moving now to our business development results. Net bookings totaled $1.9 billion in the second quarter and produced a book-to-bill ratio of 0.75. We ended the quarter with $15.9 billion in total backlog, $4.6 billion of which is funded. I would note that our largest single award in Q2, a $500-million-plus classified intelligence program, was protested and a stock work put in place. If this award was not protested, our book-to-bill would've reached 0.95, a significant improvement in the trend. Protests continue to dominate the acquisition process. We currently have 18 programs under protest with a combined award value of $1.2 billion. Award decisions and the resultant pace of bookings from our U.S. Government customers continue to slow. To put that in crisp perspective : In fiscal year '13, our average contract award from time of proposal submission was 121 days for standard contracts. This fiscal year, that timeline has slowed to 284 days. ID/IQ awards have only slowed from 283 to 296 days. Clearly, the acquisition system has stagnated in reaching decisions. And these delays exist for all contract sizes, from task orders under $5 million all the way to large $100 million programs and above. Although some of this delay is due to the lack of specific sequestration guidance given to acquisition officers from their own agencies, much of it is a result of many smaller awards of shorter duration being made and an ongoing fear of larger award decisions being protested. Despite the conditions in the acquisition system, we did see a small uptick in book-to-bill in each of the 3 segments in the quarter. And although we are not counting on any large government flush of dollars at the end of the year, we're encouraged to see some level of increased activity across the board. At the end of the second quarter, we had over $27 billion in outstanding bids. That includes $15 billion in ID/IQ bids and about $12 billion in definite-delivery bids. During the second quarter, we won 2 programs valued at more than $100 million each. So far during the third quarter, we've added 1 more $100 million program. At this time, we have over 280 opportunities in our pipeline with contract values over $100 million. With the average time from submission to award for $100 million programs averaging nearly twice as long as just a year ago, we are, however, realistic in our review of their potential contribution to our FY '14 revenues. Finally, I'd like to take just a moment to provide you an update as to the status of the split. We are nearing the finish line and we have completed all the necessary design objectives. Employees are prepared and eager to get onto their new companies. Functional teams have stood up and already operating as independent teams. IT system cutover plans are in place, tested and ready to go. And separation agreements are finalized. To that end, both companies are hosting an Investor Day in New York City on September 11 where the 2 management teams will highlight the respective investment merits of each of the 2 organizations. It is fair to say that both Leidos and new SAIC teams have been extremely busy preparing for the separation. The Leidos team has moved into its new building in Reston Town Center, while new SAIC is in the process of repositioning their team to their headquarters in the existing SAIC McLean towers. We look forward to having the split behind us and enjoying the benefits that the split will bring to both organizations. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark, who will discuss the financials for the quarter. Mark W. Sopp: Thanks, Stu. I'll again call your attention to the supplemental earnings presentation on our website, which provides additional color on our results and also our outlook. John did cover the revenue story pretty fully, so I'll focus on profitability, cash and forward guidance. On the profitability side, as previously mentioned, we are in a transition year where we are incurring substantial costs and undertaking various actions to prepare for the future. Reported operating margins for Q2 was 3%. And separation-related costs totaled $35 million in the second quarter, which diluted operating margins by 1.4%. We also had other preparatory costs related to the separation, mostly IT-focused, of $14 million, impacting margins by 0.6%. Assuming actual separation occurs soon, these separation-related costs should peak in Q3 and then wind down completely in Q4. As John mentioned, we took a $30 million impairment charge on the Reveal Imaging acquisition, reducing the overall margins by 1.2%. While Reveal and the engineering products business are our most profitable, we did not ship nor expect to ship enough units near term of Reveal units to produce the financial results necessary to support the purchase valuation a couple of years ago. Finally, the net contract write-downs of $32 million, impacting margins by 1.3%. Those write-downs were concentrated on the 4 fixed-price contracts that Stu mentioned earlier. Total net contract adjustments were $44 million on these 4 programs, offset by various write-ups elsewhere. Putting these write-downs into context : Without the adjustments on the 2 foreign development programs, net contract adjustments would've been 0 in the quarter. Operating margins did benefit by favorable cost variances related to the significant cost reductions we've been making all year hoping to offset some of this impact. These discrete items collectively diluted operating margins by 4.5%, without which, profitability would've been at a more normative level. We are very focused on the performance issues and will build on Stu's remarks about how we'll operate going forward in next week's investor conferences, with a solid quarter for operating cash flow, which exceeded $200 million in Q2. In light of this and given the nature and timing of some of the items impacting our profits this year, we are keeping our existing guidance of operating cash flow at $450 million-plus for the year. As to major takeaways for our operating segments, starting with Health and Engineering. Revenues increased 8% on a total basis year-over-year but were down 8% on an internal basis. Sector performance was driven by commercial health where revenues declined against a very difficult comparison, where it increased 35% in the prior year period. We saw a slowdown in hospital IT spending, which we believe was attributed to lower government Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements to hospitals arising out of sequestration cuts and also the 1-year delay of implementation of the revision to International Classification of Disease code referred to as ICD-10. While it's hard to predict how long this will last, we are indeed confident in the growth prospects for our solutions in the electronic health records market with respect to digitization, integration and exploitation needs over the coming years. This all results from legislation requirements and customer demands for more efficient and effective health care which is enabled by IT modernization. The profitability, the Health and Engineering operating income decline was dominated by the impairment charge on Reveal. Moving on to our National Security Solutions segment. Revenues were down 15% year-over-year. The JLI contract ramp-down alone reduced revenues this quarter by about $65 million year-over-year or more than 1/3 of the percentage decline. We also saw declines concentrated in reduced spending in Middle East operation support and also reductions in scope across the space related to federal budget cuts. Operating margins were just under 8%, adversely impacted by the 2 foreign customer fixed-price write-downs. On a normalized basis, excluding contract write-ups and write-downs, operating margins would have been roughly 9% for this segment. Higher net fees across-the-board helped minimize the effect of the write-downs enabled by cost reductions and solid performance in our core intelligence programs. For the Technical Services and Information Technology segment, which will become the new SAIC, third quarter revenues were down about 16% compared to the prior year. The loss of the DGS contract accounted for almost half of the decline, with the ramp-down in war efforts and sequestration-related cuts accounting for the remaining amount. Operating margin was 6.7%, fairly normative given the current portfolio of contracts in the sector and reflecting the ramp-down in the higher-margin DGS program. That covers a review of the operating segments. The non-operating items were as expected, so the EPS shortfall was entirely attributed to the discrete operating items I just discussed. As a reminder, our effective tax rate is expected to be in the 31% to 32% range this fiscal year, which is about 4 to 5 percentage points lower than our normative rate, reflecting the deductibility of part of the special dividend we paid earlier this year and also some other tax adjustments. I mentioned free cash flow was strong at $200 million. DSOs ended at 72 days and crept up a bit since last year due to the termination of the federal accelerated payment program and also some effect of slower payments stemming from recent government furloughs. Now let me move on to guidance. With respect to forward guidance, let me first remind you that our guidance assumes SAIC operates for full fiscal year '14 as one company, the one company as you know it today. Once our board formally approves the separation, we expect to issue standalone guidance for the 2 separate companies thereafter. Guidance is always on a continuing operations GAAP basis and fully includes the nonrecurring costs to prepare for and execute the separation transaction. For revenues, we are reducing estimates in the second half due to concerns that government spending will be worse than our original estimates. We entered the fiscal year with known reductions like JLI and DGS but with a strong pipeline of outstanding bids. The environment we are now seeing is with less confidence, but enough outstanding bids will be awarded and/or get through protest to generate meaningful revenue this year, making the known declines like JLI and other OCO-funded efforts most likely unrecoverable in the short term. Our fiscal '14 revenue guidance is now expected to be in the range of $9.7 billion to $10.2 billion. We expect operating margins to be off our previous expectations by about 80 basis points. This is driven by the write-downs we saw in Q2, about $18 million more in separation and related transition costs above our previous $140 million estimate, and volume reduction in our higher-margin commercial health area. Those changes adversely impact our EPS from continuing operations estimate by about $0.20. Accordingly, our guidance estimate for fiscal '14 is reduced to a range of $0.95 to $1.03 per share. Operating margins, excluding separation and transition costs, are expected to run in the 7% to 8% range in aggregate in the second half of fiscal '14, barring any unforeseen items. And finally, as earlier stated, our cash flow guidance remains unchanged at $450 million-plus. Wrapping up. We did have some select performance issues in Q2, which we are indeed addressing, but the vast majority of the business executed reasonably well given the headwinds we had entering the year and the overall challenging market conditions. We have made good progress on cost-reduction efforts in core operations and are now seeing margin benefits which will be amplified when we complete the separation and put the transition costs we are incurring today behind us. There are a number of actions you'll hear about in next week's Investor Day that will better clarify how both companies will exit this transition period and embark on a focused path for predictable profits, cash generation and cash deployment. With that, I'll turn it back over to John. John P. Jumper: Thanks, Mark. Looking forward, the entire SAIC leadership team, our Board of Directors and the 37,000 employees remain extremely optimistic about the future of these 2 great companies we are creating, Leidos and new SAIC. We believe we're in the final stages of preparation to complete that separation in the near future. And with that, I'll open the floor up to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Could you give us a little more color on the specific problems before problem programs? And secondly, you mentioned you're going to be a little pickier, but fixed-price development with new customers, particularly foreign and state and local, are kind of, like, for many analysts, a red flag. How many other contracts of that sort still are in your backlog? K. Stuart Shea : Cai, this is Stu. We have a very rigorous process of review of all of our programs and we have a watch list that we pay particular attention to. Of the 9,000 contracts that we have within the company today, we have about 25 programs that are on that white -- on that watch list. And all 4 of the contracts that we noted in our call just a moment ago were on that watch list. But based upon our Q2 testing, our customer interaction and schedule requirements, we really determined that our 2 foreign contracts needed to be redesigned. And we had to increase our cost and resourcing to meet schedules for the other 2 contracts, so we adjusted the EACs accordingly. These types of estimates at completion or estimates to complete are a standard process in any quarter, and there's a lots of ups and downs. They just all happen to have happened at the same time because of technical or customer milestones in Q2 which bore out new information. So we feel pretty confident in the overall process of review, but we did use the opportunity to do a deep dive on much of our contract baseline this quarter to take a look and see whether or not we had any other issues. And right now, we don't see any that confront us with the same level of concern that we had in the other ones. Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then you'd mentioned that, going forward, you're going to be a little bit more, I guess, picky about what you do. Are you going to continue to take fixed-price development contracts with state and local and foreign customers? Or are you going to basically have a policy where you kind of stick to customers you know a little better? K. Stuart Shea : All right, well, let's see, the first answer is we do a lot of fixed-price work and we do a lot of fixed-price development and solutions work, so we're going to continue that. And then we'll continue with the customer sets. But I think it's, when you cross the particular type of contract and the particular customer, this was a little bit out of the ordinary. And we also had folks that were working on these contracts that weren't necessarily the best in the company to focus on them. So it was kind of the perfect storm of the contract, the nature of the customer, the nature of deliverable, the timing of it. And we had an opportunity to fix it, so we did. So we're going to keep focusing on many of the same calls. We'll do a lot of business in future SAIC and state and local business. We'll continue to pursue our foreign customers in Leidos and in new SAIC. And we're just going to be a lot more attentive to the nature of the delivery, the nature of the requirements and how we go about staffing the programs. Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Just one last one. You had, had a cost target of $350 million. What is your cost target -- saving target today? How much more do you have to go to get there? And how does that split between the 2 new businesses? K. Stuart Shea : Yes, again, Cai, we completed our cost cuts of $350 million, split approximately $200 million for Leidos and $150 million for new SAIC. And I think we're on track for that full $350 million program cut. And those cuts far exceed any dis-synergy costs that we have related to splitting the 2 companies, which is nominally $50 million to $60 million on a full year basis. What our plan going forward is to really have a -- and we've already started this, a continued improvement process. We expect there will be more cost changes to come. Post separation, both Leidos and new SAIC will have active programs. It will be a little bit different between the 2 companies to address this. And the cost reductions that we've seen in FY '14 have considerably lowered our FY '14 wrap rates and they'll have greater impact in FY '15 and beyond on a full year basis. So as you know, FY '14 is kind of a transitional year, and you'll see more evidence of the impact in FY '15 and beyond. And we're going to talk more about that at the investor conference on the 11th. Operator : And our next question is from Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : You mentioned the potential for ongoing divestitures. I was curious if you could also talk about your intent on the acquisition side of the equation, as many believe that we're going to be consolidating here the next few years. And within that context, can you offer any sense of what leverage of limits you'd be happy with, with the 2 companies? John P. Jumper: Let me address the -- this is John Jumper. Let me the M&A plans. And you'll be -- we'll be hearing more about this at the investor conference, of M&A and capital deployment, as we come up to the 11th. But I think, broadly speaking, on M&A, we can say that we'll be much more focused on predictable profit streams and returning capital to our shareholders with M&A. And as always, we're going to try and maintain a balance, but I think the balance is going to favor taking better advantage of not building up a bunch of cash on the balance sheet and returning that to the shareholder. These are decisions that the Board of Directors make every quarter, and I think we'll continue to look at it that way. Mark W. Sopp: And Ed, this is Mark. I'll comment on the leverage ratios going forward. As the 2 companies exit this transition period and embark on a separate track, they will have leverage ratios on the 1.5x to 2x range, each of them, as previously stated and as originally designed. That would generally be where we would intend to operate, for the most part, going forward. We would be willing to lever up to closer toward 3x in both companies should the right compelling opportunities arise. But it's very important on the Leidos side we maintain an investment-grade rating and make sure the credit markets are available to us. As we said, that's less important on the new SAIC side. But we still want to operate the capital structures, as John said, with less excess cash, number one; but a fairly conservative leverage ratio in the 1.5x to 2.5x sort of arena. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Great. Could you talk a little bit about where you think the September, the government's fourth quarter, will come in as far as award activity is concerned, relative to the fourth quarter a year ago? John P. Jumper: Well, let me start off. This is John. I think that if there's one word to describe the situation we're in right now, it's confused. As we -- I have a hard time, and I think my colleagues in the industry have a hard time, even defining what the baseline is right now. The spending patterns are erratic. I think there's great caution among the contracting officers out there that we do business with day in and day out, which is our best indication of volatility. So I think to try and be predictive about a fourth quarter or an end of year, even, for the government where you normally see a flush, trying to be predictive about that, is extremely difficult. And I think it would be dangerous for anyone to try and define in any way what's going to happen. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : My last question. Mr. Kendall came out in the last few days and mentioned that they had done things to sort of get through Government 13 and that there are harder decisions to come. How would you interpret that as far as the flow of funding to the government services sector in general? John P. Jumper: Well, I think, well, Frank Kendall, I think, has been an outstanding spokesman for -- not only for the Pentagon and for government spending but for the rest of us in the industry. And I think what Frank is referring to are some of the things we talked about earlier. We've seen a pronounced 10% reduction in intelligence budgets. You've heard some of the agency leadership talking about that here just in the recent -- in recent weeks, yet the level of activity out there in the big world is anything but a level that would indicate a reduction in intelligence activity. So I think that there's some conflict here between what we're seeing out there in the world and the demands that we see being fairly well sustained on things like intelligence. Having said that, I do believe that the government is looking for continued efficiencies. And I think that we will see, as Frank said, a decrease in spending, delayed decisions, and I think this all adds to the confusion I was talking about earlier. Operator : And next is Ben Owens with Stifel, Nicolaus. Benjamin E. Owens - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : First off, on the construction project write-down you guys talked about, can you guys go into more detail there, maybe talk about what the size was and the reason for the write-down? Mark W. Sopp: This is Mark. The construction project predominantly refers to our Plainfield renewable plant under construction in the state of Connecticut. And it was, by itself, in the low teens in terms of the EAC adjustment for added costs to make sure we could reach our very important deliverable in the fall timeframe. And so we invested more, if you will, to make sure we hit schedule, which is very important on that program. Benjamin E. Owens - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : And then you talked about the reasons for the Reveal acquisition write-down, but can you maybe go into some more detail there and talk about the trends you've seen in the baggage scanner space? And are you seeing a work slowdown? Or are you losing market share? Could you go into some more detail there? K. Stuart Shea : Yes. Ben, this is Stu. First of all, I think we have a very strong safety and security business, which includes the Reveal product line. And we are seeing a lack of orders across the entire industry from TSA for the checked baggage scanning systems. TSA has about 2,000 explosives detection systems that have been installed since 2002, with a useful life of around 7 to 10 years. And they're hoping to extend that to 15 years and incorporate some newer technologies to include addressing homemade explosives and the 75% direct mask [ph]. So although TSA has the funding at this time, they're not purchasing any units until they reduce their inventory in the warehouse. And then they'll have to -- if you look at the mathematics of the number of units deployed, how old they are, they're going to have to incorporate additional units over time. So we look at the Reveal product line as a very solid product line, very capable, industry leading. And it really is about the slowness in the awards across the industry and not for our particular product line itself. Mark W. Sopp: And just to add to Stu's remarks. That business has been very successfully integrated with the rest of the security products business run by Alex Preston. And that business, Reveal, by itself, is profitable today, in large part, due to those efforts. The impairment was $30 million. That's about half of the intangible value for that acquisition, to put that into context, and entirely due to not necessarily the long-term prospects we see there but the slide to the right due to the procurement costs we see, as Stu mentioned, and because of that, appropriate to remove some of the valuation originally described in the acquisition. Operator : And our next question is from George Price with BB&T Capital Markets. George A. Price - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : I guess, first thing, just on the environment, obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty, but if I just kind of -- my feel of your comments just now, it seems that some of your peers may be discussing or suggesting a more modest impact from the budget environment in the sequester, almost like we've sort of seen the worst of it. And that's not my perception of what I'm hearing from you. And so I was wondering if you could maybe comment on that a little bit further and maybe in terms of how do you see this playing out over the next couple of quarters. When do you think the full impact of the sequester and the current environment is really going to be felt? John P. Jumper: Let me start. This is John. I think Frank Kendall's words are exactly right, and I think his caution is that we probably have not seen the full impact of sequestration yet, and I think we need to take that into consideration. As I said, this adds to the confusion. So I think there's probably more to come. How much is hard to say. But I think Frank was being open and honest when he said that there is more to come. Mark W. Sopp: I'll just add. The trailing outlays from either prior years or otherwise probably buffered some of the reduction in the recent few months across the industry. That will strip away. And the, as John said, full impact of sequestration is most likely ahead of us, and for that reason, we are more cautious in our guidance in the second half and taking it down accordingly. George A. Price - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay, I got you. And then just you talked about JLI and DGS taking revenue down by about $150 million year-over-year, and attributing much of the rest due to sequester and drawdown. I was wondering, in the press release, you threw out a couple other intel programs and a network operations management program that were also impacting revenue, when you discussed the segments. Are those in that $150 million? Or can you quantify them at all either as actual revenue or as a percent? And what I'm really trying to circle around in as much detail as possible is what can we attribute to the broader cuts and what can we attribute to things that have rolled off. Mark W. Sopp: I'll give that a shot, George. This is Mark. First, there are no programs that approach the size of JLI and DGS in terms of magnitude and impact on our year-over-year results. So those really dominate the landscape, those individual programs. As you know, those 2 programs were 2 of our 4 largest programs in the company that, for 2 different reasons, came to an end last year and we're seeing the effects of that in the year-over-year numbers this year. I'd say there was a collection of airborne ISR programs that came to natural end, associated with troupe reductions and so forth, in the Middle East. Those probably accounted for 3 to 4 percentage points of reduction in the national security sector. But outside of that, you really have a lot of smaller contracts, some coming into the mix, providing growth, and others moving away through the overall reductions we're seeing. So it's really a mixed bag after those 2, primarily. George A. Price - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay. And last one, real quick, on the EPS guidance. You talked through the write-downs, the incremental costs, volume in commercial health. I think you called that out, Mark, as $0.20 of impact to guidance. The upper end was taken down by $0.30. Is that -- or what are the additional factors there? Is that just uncertainty with respect to the environment moving? Just maybe call that out in a little bit more detail. Mark W. Sopp: Yes, the $0.20, George, is directly attributable to what I said in my early remarks, the charges we took in Q2, primarily, and the reduction in the revenue guidance for the rest of the year. So with respect to stripping off the top end, we no longer see the magnitude of possible upside that we had in our earlier guidance. If you'll remember, that was $10.7 billion. So we've taken that down pretty dramatically and narrowed the range on revenue and, therefore, narrowed the range on EPS. Operator : And our next question is from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I'd like to focus in on the commercial healthcare a little bit. It seems like, relative to last quarter, your expectations have changed quite a bit. And I know you gave some comments on it in your prepared remarks, it's just that it's a little hazier, but you still have good long-term expectations. But I was wondering if you could delve into that in a little bit more detail. Mark W. Sopp: Sure, Joe. It's Mark. Both the Vitalize and maxIT acquisitions came out of the gates very strong post acquisition, and we were speaking about those growth numbers over the past few quarters. As mentioned, we are now seeing the spillover effects from the surprise, if you will, that came with sequestration where the Medicare cuts that applied to hospitals were -- are taking billions of dollars of reimbursements out of the system pretty suddenly, and by surprise, and understandably, administrations of those hospitals have cut back their discretionary spending. That said, the same federal government has mandated the ICD-10 requirements and the Meaningful Use requirements and further stages after that, coupled with the ongoing development proving that there can be better clinical outcomes by use of EHR systems and the data exploitation opportunities that come with that. So we're very bullish on the long-term outlook for our commercial health business. We are even more bullish as we combine the technologies of the government business with the commercial group to see how they can benefit each other. And so with that, tier numbers speaking, the commercial health business starting off growing and then recent contraction will be about flat this year. We're optimistic that we'll return to growth next year, as those deadlines approach for Meaningful Use and ICD-10, and for all of the opportunities to improve clinical outcomes and administrative outcomes for hospitals in future years. Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Mark, were those businesses evaluated for impairment, as Reveal was? And can you just comment on how we should think about that going forward? Mark W. Sopp: Sure. All businesses are evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis. And there's about -- for your records, about $60 million of purchased intangibles related to our commercial health businesses that we acquired over the past couple of years, and then there's a larger goodwill number after that. But based on our projections, we are comfortable that those long-lived assets are not impaired. Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And just finally, on the strategy. I know we're going to learn much more next week in a lot more detail, but just on the strategy, the -- I think the premise -- part of the premise, as I understood it, is the separation here was to create a stable company that was pretty much all government. And that -- and then another one, that was more growth oriented, with a mix of commercial and government businesses that was more acquisitive. It seems like -- I know there's uncertainty in scanners and I know there's uncertainty but you're still bullish in commercial healthcare, but is there -- are we pulling in the horns a little bit on the growth ambitions for Leidos? Or am I not hearing that right? I guess, John, that question's to you. John P. Jumper: Joe, I think it's safe to say that we are still very bullish on expanding our commercial presence and for that to be a larger percentage of our business. As we go forward and we look at Leidos individually, our Health and Engineering will be about 1/3 of our company. And we do want to see that expand. Now when you balance that with the current dynamics of government budgets and what we're seeing, I must say it does introduce a certain amount of caution into how we move forward. But we want to get to a place where we're focused on profitability and running the businesses well. It's, I think, safe to say we'd like to really exploit our internal capacity to grow, to begin with. We don't see any large M&As on the horizon. We want to focus on that internal growth potential, but we do want to grow those commercial markets to take advantage of their growth potential. And I think that's what we're going to see. Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And then just one quick final one, a numbers question, Mark, back to you. Can you give us, on a combined basis, on a normalized basis, x all of the items that of course are coming through the system now, what you expect corporate costs to be for the 2 companies combined, and maybe broken up by company? Mark W. Sopp: Joe, we have not publicly provided a separate view of corporate costs before. If you're referring to dis-synergies perhaps, is that the nature of your question? Or can you be more specific? Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : No. Well, you're reporting in the segments, as I believe, they're going to be in the new companies, the 2 in Leidos and then the 1 in new SAIC. And corporate costs, there's just so many items in corporate costs as of -- of course, you're going through all of these efforts, the reorganization, everything else you're doing, but to arrive at a normal -- a normalized profitability estimate looking forward, I think corporate costs are a critical component, unless I'm not thinking about the model the right way. So I mean, you've taken so much cost out. You've provided the $350 million. You've provided the offsets, the dis-synergy offsets. But when you net all that out so we can come up with earnings estimates for a couple of years out, how do we think about the corporate cost? Mark W. Sopp: Okay, let me try to answer that, and I'll provide more color next week as well. But with respect to the corporate segment that we report, which does include some nonrecurring and special charges from time to time, particularly this year, but when you extract that out, they typically run between $5 million and $10 million per quarter, which reflects stock option expense and other expenses not allocable to the sectors. With the going-forward model, I would say, the combination of dis-synergies on one hand, offset by cuts on the other, I wouldn't expect a major change from that run rate on a consolidated basis across the 2 companies. And another way to think about that is the same cost categories dilute the segment margins by 10 to 20 basis points on an annual basis. Operator : Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : I just wanted to revisit some of the revenue synergy assumptions that you guys have been talking about for a while post split, the $1 billion or so over the subsequent 2 to 3 years. Is there any change at all in that thinking just given the fact that, as you guys alluded to, the end markets actually seem to be worsening rather than stabilizing? John P. Jumper: Well, let me give it -- try that, Jason. I think that, you balance the uncertainty of the revenue stream going forward with the situation of the world, and somehow, those don't comport very well right now. So I -- we continue to believe that, given the situation we're in globally, opportunities will continue to rise. You've heard me say it before in these earnings calls that we seem to be, as a nation, a lousy predictors of what's going to happen next. We don't ever seem to be able to get it right. And then, something always happens. So I think that given you balance the uncertainties of the world with actions that you see underway right now, even with the decision about Syria, all of these things lead me to believe that the revenue opportunities will continue to be there given the world we live in. K. Stuart Shea : Yes, Jason, this is Stu. Just to add to that comment : One of the things we've talked about a lot is the potential uplift from OCI reduction. And we've spent a lot of time evaluating the capability foothold that we do have relevant to all these new markets. We're making some key strategic hires to gain some customer intimacy into the markets. We're building the opportunity funnels and strategies that allow us to address the markets. And we're also preparing a plan with investments and capture strategies. And that's happening on both the Leidos in the new SAIC side. Obviously, at this point of kind of purgatory that we're in where -- we can't really fully explore that because of we're the -- we're still 1 company today. Until we're 2 companies, we can't really see the benefits of that. So we're doing a lot of prepositioning but expect to see some different outcomes in the future. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. I mean, is there any reason to believe that the $1 billion estimate is too aggressive? Or is it simply too soon to say? Mark W. Sopp: There's still a 10% growth in our addressable market. That has not changed. And so those revenue opportunities are still the same as we see it. The timeframe, given the environment we're in, could change since the procurement cycle, as we see it today, is lengthening. And I'll just further add to the remarks of John and Stu : As we evaluate those opportunities, we're going to be very profit-focused. And so chasing top line is nice, but they have to represent to us high-confidence profitable growth year-over-year in order to go after those. And that will be the lens through which we evaluate them. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. And just timing on when you now think the breakup will be consummated, when the split will be consummated. I mean, do you think it will end up falling in your fiscal Q3? Or is it more likely in the January quarter? John P. Jumper: Well, Jason, we can't be specific on that, but let me just say the plans are on-track. The transactional part of the stuff is largely done. We are going to have a board vote. And we're on track to complete it by the end of the FY, which is what our publicly announced schedule is. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. And just last one for Mark, on the separation-related costs. I know you mentioned that they're going to peak in Q3. Can you give us a general range, just to get everyone on the same page, as far as what people will be modeling for the quarter? Mark W. Sopp: Yes. So if you take the 158 estimate for the year, we're about 100-plus through that through Q2. I would expect a peak of much of the remaining 50 ballpark in Q3 and the trail-on in Q4 and be done as we enter fiscal '15. Operator : And next is James Friedman with SIG. James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : I just had one question, one housekeeping in nature. Mark, your 10-Q had referenced some of the changes to the Fairfax County, Virginia, facilities and the lease buyback there. I was trying to estimate the potential savings from those assumptions. I think it references $70 million. Could you walk us through some of the timing of that and if that estimate is about right? Mark W. Sopp: Look, I'll add just color and see if it addresses the question. So the Fairfax reference is the McLean headquarters property that we announced in July a sale transaction in, which is a bundled sale. And we recognized cash proceeds and a minor P&L consequence in Q2, cash proceeds meaning $85 million, and about a $2 million loss on that transaction at the end of the day. I think the -- and just importantly, that's just part of an overall real estate monetization plan to take cash out of the real estate holdings and put it back into either our business or our shareholders' pockets. The $70 million reference, I have to believe, relates to our estimate of leased exit costs that we would incur and report in this fiscal year as part of our overall separation activity. And so we are well on our way toward achieving that. That's still our estimate for the year, roughly. And so that contemplates shrinking our footprint significantly by 20%, 25% across both companies to become more efficient and more profitable. And the $70 million is the future lease expenses for those properties we will exit deliberately this fiscal year, the payback of which will be within 1 year. And so that's a significant margin-enhancement opportunity, particularly visible in fiscal '15 and beyond. Operator : Next is Robert Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Mark, you just noticed -- noted the profit focus for your growth lanes, but the impairments on the fixed-price development contracts suggest that perhaps pricing and competition may be partially at work here. So while you say your revenue opportunity remains intact for the commercial businesses, should be -- should competition ultimately change the margin or the net profit growth there? Or are you seeing greater competitive forces on pricing that maybe you expected at first, either Mark or Stu, on that one? Mark W. Sopp: Rob, Mark here. I think I would say that the contracts mentioned were bid some time ago and reflect the then-thinking in terms of priorities. What we are saying going forward is we will be very profit-focused for things we bid going forward, and very selective on that premise. There are, of course, pricing pressures today. And there are -- there will be cases where, given margin on a program may not be equivalent to the overall company margin. But if it produces or contributes to year-over-year profit dollar growth and has a favorable ROI and has low capital intensity, we'll probably do it because, as Stu mentioned in his remarks, we're focused on economic profit. And so year-over-year growth and capital efficiency is the name of the game going forward. That is the lens that we'll be focusing on as we conduct future bids. Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. Stu, is it fair to say that, today, given what's going on in the environment, though, that there are more people entering these growth lanes, and therefore, the competition and pricing is getting even more aggressive than what you might have bid a couple of years ago? K. Stuart Shea : Let me add a couple of comments. I think John wants to jump in on this also. But if you look at some of the markets that people are entering, let's talk about Health and Engineering, we've been in those businesses for 25 years, so there's a lot of people that are doing an attachment to their business, some more of an appliqu\u00e9, an add-on, whereas we really have it as a core fundamental part of our strategy and part of our business and has been for several years. And you'll certainly see a good part of that in Leidos going forward, with the Health and Engineering focus. I think that there is a continued sense of concern on the part of small businesses, it's their livelihood, to try to continue to keep their business. They're being very aggressive in the pricing. I think some of the big guys that are platform builders are also being very aggressive. So what Mark said, we look at pricing pressures all the time. We think part of that is been offset by our reduction in our wrap rate. I think part of our solutions focus and at least a good part of the company will offset that. We're very agile in our developments. We think we have the right solutions and we can build them generally faster than many others. And so a lot of our focus is on differentiating ourselves through our history, our legacy in the businesses, the unique intimacy that we have with our customers and our ability to develop solutions in a more rapid-solution approach. Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : So you're saying that what affected the contracts for which you wrote down in the quarter, you took write-downs in the quarter, that those things are not happening going forward. You're not seeing whatever pressures you saw when you priced those. Were you not reacting to them? K. Stuart Shea : Well, I think it's a mixed bag. I think, some of them, we priced very aggressively. And then I think some were priced appropriately, but we didn't necessarily have the right solution path going forward. So it depends on which program that we're referring to in a write-down. But it's a little bit of each is right, that there are some that are more technical oriented and there are some that are just resource constrained. So we had to do a write-down on both. John P. Jumper: And Robert, you're right when you say that there was a much different environment when those programs were bid several years ago. Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. And then, Stu, you mentioned the 25 watch list programs, and you talked about that 4 focused programs for this quarter came from that group. How -- in aggregate, how large are those 25 as a percentage, perhaps, of sales or margin? Mark W. Sopp: Rob, this is Mark. I'd say our top 25 represents maybe 20% of our total revenues, maybe 25%. And I think the top -- or the 25 in the watch list are a subset, not necessarily the largest. So I think it's within that range. Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. And then just a last thing. General Jumper, you've talked about some awards post quarter. It sounds like you've been fairly active. Should we be looking for -- what type of book-to-bill do you see here in the current quarter? It sounds like it'll be better than the first 2? John P. Jumper: Yes, let me... K. Stuart Shea : If I could jump on that one. First of all, I think our book-to-bill was low by historical standards, as we mentioned before. I think we had a pretty strong pipeline. We currently have $27 billion in submits that are outstanding waiting award. So if you assume a normative state last couple of years, you would expect the book-to-bill to rise. But once you add in the slowness in the award decisions, the doubling or 2.5x in terms of that timing for the award decisions, and then the protests that are happening, I think we may have hit a new normative level in the 0.7 range or so for at least a period of time. John P. Jumper: What's happened, the -- I think it's fair to say, is that all of our normal ways we calibrate, turning award wins into revenue, have been delayed. So the predictability is much more difficult than it's been in the past. K. Stuart Shea : Yes, one of the things that's happening now is that the customers are doling out much smaller increments of funding on a much shorter period of performance. So as opposed to getting a large hit, a large booking for a multiyear program, you're getting things by the drink. Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Would you say that a 0.7 normative rate, though, might suggest that the revenue guidance is a bit optimistic? K. Stuart Shea : I think, if you look at what we said before about the potential inclusion of a large $500 million win, we would have been at 0.95 if that was included. So we are getting some wins. We are getting the core business, but I'd -- we'd like to be above 1 all the time but we're just not there at this time, and very few people are. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions. I'll turn the call back to John Jumper for closing comments. John P. Jumper: Thank you very much. And let me just say that -- I'd like to take a moment to congratulate 2 members of our team. First, Debbie James is one of our sector presidents who's been leading our technical and engineering business and has been nominated by President Obama to become Secretary of the Air Force. If confirmed, this will continue Debbie's selfless commitment to answering the call of government service when asked. We also extend our congratulations to a member of our Board of Directors, France C\u00f3rdova. France recently stepped down from her position as President of Purdue University and has been nominated by President Obama to become Director of the National Science Foundation. All of us at SAIC are proud to embrace the caliber of people nominated to these positions of national importance. And we wish Debbie and France all the best going through their confirmation process. Thank you, all, very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the SAIC Conference Call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Leidos Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Sweeney, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Leidos. Sir, you may begin. John Sweeney : Thank you, Shauna, and good morning. I'd like to welcome you to our third quarter fiscal year 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me today are John Jumper, our Chairman and CEO; Stu Shea, our COO; and Mark Sopp, our CFO; and other members of our leadership team.  During the call, we will make forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding the company and our expectations about its future financial and operating performance. These statements are subject to a number of risks that could cause actual events to differ materially, and I refer you to our SEC filings for a discussion of these risks. In addition, these statements represent our views as of today. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our views to change. We may elect to update the forward-looking statements at some point in the future, but we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so.  I'd now like to turn the call over to John Jumper, our Chairman and CEO. John Jumper : Thank you, John, and welcome, everyone. On December 3, we provided third quarter fiscal year 2014 data that included revised earnings guidance. All of the information we are providing you today is consistent with that data. We have recently encountered a range of additional challenges that severely impacted our quarterly performance and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Stu and Mark will discuss the specifics, but let me provide an overview. We previously told you about the overall impact of the sequester. Negative impact intensified in the quarter, exacerbated by the government shutdown. Increasing impact of the sequester, which includes reductions in duration and scope of programs, is now starting to impact intelligence programs, which we previously believed to be less vulnerable to sequestration cuts. In addition, we continue to see a high level of protest affecting both the third and fourth quarters. In Health and Engineering, we had anticipated sequential flat performance in commercial health through fiscal year '14. We are now experiencing hospital IT budgets being further pressured by continuing declines in Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements and intensified by general turbulence associated with the standup of the Affordable Care Act registration process in October. The combined impacts resulted in a lowering of our forecast in November and triggered a write-down of intangible assets at the end of the quarter. Two of our energy-related design build projects, Plainfield and Gradient, had unanticipated bad debt charges. In October, we experienced a significant decline in collections from the government, driven by the government shutdown, our own planned IT shutdown to enable our separation and customer confusion driven by our name change. Combination of these factors resulted in a substantial change in our working capital usage, adversely impacting our operating cash flow in Q3 and extends into our forecast for the fourth quarter.  The guidance reductions provided in our preliminary release were driven by several factors that Mark will discuss. We developed our guidance through a diligent and rigorous process based on the best information available to us at the time, recognizing that our business and the markets in which we operate are fluid and often difficult to predict. Unfortunately, several of the factors that we did not expect to affect our financial performance did, in fact, have a negative impact. We have also announced that Joe Craver is stepping aside as President of our Health and Engineering business sector. The board and I agree that this sector will benefit from new leadership. I will be stepping in immediately as acting head of the sector while we launch a search for a new leader. We thank Joe for his 24 years of dedicated service to the company and wish him the best as he moves forward. Let me finish by providing a longer-term perspective. We serve markets that are large and critical to our nation and its way of life. Our 23,000 employee workforce dutifully serves the most demanding customers with innovative solutions and services, with a strong reputation for delivery in our 3 markets. We remain confident in the potential of our 3 core businesses, and that is supported by our strong bookings in the quarter.  Our management team recently presented our Board of Directors with a thorough review of our performance, as well as an update on our strategy. We are pleased to announce today that our Board of Directors has approved a $20 million share buyback authorization, representing almost 25% of our share count to facilitate the capital deployment strategy and priorities we discussed back in September.  At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to our President and COO, Stu Shea, for an update on our operational objectives and the strategies we're employing to achieve it. K. Shea: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. In our Q2 call, I shared with you our operating philosophies that we would be rolling out over the coming quarters to improve our performance. In short, they are : first, to assure you that we are going to stay laser-focused on our core businesses; second, that we would also be more active in the divestiture of nonstrategic or nonperforming businesses; third, that we would balance our historical emphasis on top line growth with a future focus on year-over-year improvement of economic profit; fourth, that we will would expand our culture of continuous improvement and operational efficiencies to continue to drive out costs; and finally, that we would be much more focused on deploying our excess cash to benefit our shareholders.  Let me give you a quick summary of how we're doing against these 5 objectives. To start, we have placed a lot of emphasis on expanding our business pipeline and in bidding and winning new work in our core markets. Despite the broader market challenges, our qualified pipeline currently stands at about $80 billion, much of it in the areas recently opened up through the removal of organizational conflict of interest and by aggressively positioning for work in our core markets. Our business development results in the quarter were significantly improved, delivering $3.1 billion in gross bookings. However, it's important to note that we are starting to see these new programs start slower and at a lower level than originally anticipated. In our national security segment, our largest single new award was a $467 million classified cyber intelligence program that we originally won back in Q2 but was protested by the incumbent. That protest was denied and the contract re-awarded to Leidos. The second major new award was a $440 million TSA integrated logistics support contract. Both of these awards were new wins for us in our core markets. We also won a $108 million extension of an existing classified cyber intelligence program. In addition, our in-theater airborne ISR business continues to prove its value to war fighters, with a follow-on $195 million award for continued support of our BuckEye platform.  In the engineering segment, we booked $118 million cost-reimbursable contract from LSB Industries to provide engineering procurement and construction services for the relocation of an ammonia plant and associated facilities. We are not involved in any financing elements of that contract. In the health business, we booked $178 million prime contract from the Defense Health Agency to implement a Nurse Advice Line supporting the Military Health System. Despite these and many other wins that led to strong quarterly bookings performance, the quarter also experienced significant de-bookings of $700 million, most of which had a more immediate impact to near-term revenues. Decisions by our customers to shorten multiyear programs, reduce FTEs on labor contracts, reduce product purchases and curtail or outright cancel programs contributed to that significant reduction in bookings. This led to a net bookings total of $2.4 billion in the quarter, which still produced a strong book-to-bill of 1.7. This brings our year-to-date book-to-bill rate to 1.0. We ended the quarter with almost $10 billion in total backlog, $3 billion of which is funded. As we noted in our Q2 call, we did not expect any major year-end flush of awards. Well, there wasn't. Unfortunately, several of our current programs that we fully expected to be extended at the turn of the government fiscal year were cut dramatically with little advanced notice. For example, the funding on one of our larger U.S. Army analytic programs, the distributed PED initiative, was cut by $92 million and reduced by 120 FTEs, where we expected continued staffing levels and associated revenues. This is the nature of today's uncertain national security market. The combination of all these factors has resulted in lower expected revenue in our fourth quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had over $14 billion in outstanding bids. That includes $8.5 billion in ID/IQ bids and $5.6 billion in definite-delivery bids. During the quarter, we won 8 programs valued at more than $100 million each. In Q4, we've added another -- an $800 million ID/IQ win at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and currently have over 150 opportunities in our pipeline with over $100 million in contract value each. With the average time from submission to award of $100 million programs averaging nearly twice as long as just a year ago, we are, however, realistic, in our view, of their potential contribution to our FY '14 revenues. As we've noted to you before, protests continue to dominate the acquisition process. We currently have 19 programs under protest, with a combined award value of almost $1.3 billion. On the second philosophy noted above, divestitures, we have continued the deliberate strategic review of our business portfolio. As part of that portfolio-shaping effort, we are focusing on our competitive position, the importance of the business area to our overarching strategy and the profit opportunity each business area contributes to our economic profit goals.  In the quarter, we have made some small divestitures. We sold our global antiterrorism assistance or GATA contract. We sold our stake at BPL Global. And we sold our commercial machine language translation business. These divestitures in aggregate had a small cash and net nonoperating P&L gain in the quarter. And finally, we have begun to look at strategic options for at least one other product line that is not core to our future. We expect that decision to be reflected in Q4. These portfolio-shaping efforts are not large, but like several other similar businesses retained by Leidos in the split, they were a management distraction and/or dilution to our earnings. Bottom line, this is a journey, and we have begun in earnest the process of honing our portfolio for the future. The third operational philosophy of proven profit focus is underway, and we have started our economic profit initiative across the company. While still in early stages, we believe this is focusing the company on value creation as we move forward. As you know, our focus on cost reduction has yielded over $200 million of improvement in annualized overhead and G&A costs. This has proven to be vitally important this year as we are operating well within our indirect pricing rates despite our labor base being down more significantly than we forecast. In addition, in September, we noted that we were planning to continue to reduce our indirect costs across the enterprise by an additional $50 million to $100 million by actions we plan to take this and next fiscal year. We have been very aggressive in that process. And since the creation of Leidos a little over 2 months ago, we have defined specific cost-reduction opportunities in that range. These items include elimination of consolidation of positions at the corporate and sector levels, further consolidation of services into our enterprise shared services, renegotiation of an extensive number of our third-party service contracts, consolidation or elimination of unneeded or underutilized IT services and centralization of travel and material purchases, just to name a few. Our success here will have lasting impact on our financial performance. The final area of operational focus was our desire to return significant value to our shareholders and more aggressively deploying excess cash. The announcement today of a broad stock buyback authorization for approximately 25% of our outstanding shares reaffirms our previously stated capital allocation priorities.  With that, I will turn the call over to Mark, who will discuss the financials for the quarter. Mark Sopp : Thanks very much, Stu. I'll turn your attention to the earnings presentation that you can find on our website to complement these remarks. Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 were $1 -- $1.42 billion, down 15% compared to prior year. On a sequential basis, revenues were down $46 million compared to the second quarter of this year, with the most significant delta being the ongoing adverse effects of contract reductions like the Joint Logistics contract, broad impacts from sequestration and reductions to commercial health revenues.  As you might recall, we took down guidance on our second quarter earnings report on September 4 to reflect our latest views on the business conditions at that time. As a result of our experience in the third quarter, what we now see and how our customers are responding to the budget and market conditions that they face, on December 3, we reduced expectations further for the year. We are now seeing more impacts from sequestration, including cuts in parts of our intelligence business which we previously thought were less vulnerable. In addition, market conditions for our commercial health business are softer than expected. Uncertainties have been introduced by concerns over the Affordable Care Act rollout, and just last week, another delay was announced for the deadline on Meaningful Use Stage 2 criteria.  While we believe health IT will be a longer-term growth market, we've seen these uncertainties delaying hospital IT investments, such as EHR projects and related enhancements. Our updated guidance reflects these recent developments.  On the profitability side, we had a number of specific items significantly impacting our third quarter results. Operating loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 was $7 million, down from operating income of $100 million in the third quarter of last year. The reduction in operating income was primarily attributable to $42 million of bad debt expense for receivables related to the Plainfield and Gradient energy and construction projects, $25 million of planned separation transaction and restructuring expenses, $11 million in IT infrastructure costs to enable our separation, $19 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to our commercial health business and $5 million in legal and regulatory expenses.  Diluted loss per share from continuing operations was $0.11, down from diluted income per share of $0.66 in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, driven by the operating income decline. The diluted share count was 84 million, up 1% from the 83 million in the third quarter of last year.  Moving on to cash flow. Operating cash flow was $48 million and $77 million for the 3 and 9 months ended October 31, respectively. This is below our expectations. In the press release last week, we reduced our cash flow guidance by $175 million, reflecting a reduction from $325 million to the new revised guidance of $150 million. This reduction is primarily due to a projected unfavorable variance in use of working capital, coupled with a reduction in net income as compared to our previous forecast. Specifically, our revised forecast uses $145 million more in working capital versus our previous forecast. Most of this increased use is in receivables. The bottom end of our EPS guidance range reflects about a $90 million reduction in net income, about $60 million of which is noncash from charges in Q3. Thus, $30 million of the reduction is real cash earnings. $145 million increase in working capital plus the $30 million reduction in lower cash earnings constitutes the $175 million reduction in projected operating cash flow.  Here's why we are seeing the increased uses of working capital. First, as planned, we've shut down our systems during Q3 for about 10 days to enable our separation and to set up the 2 companies. Our recovery and catching-up on the billings is taking some time, and we project that some of the ensuing collections are likely to spill over into next year. Second, we experienced payment delays from some customers due to the confusion over our name change from SAIC to Leidos. We're managing this on a day-to-day basis, but consequently, some collections have shifted out in time. And third, since the government shutdown in mid-October, we have seen a slower pace in collections from our U.S. government customer. In the current environment, we can't be sure the speed of collections will catch up in the remaining 1.5 months we have left in our fiscal year and have revised our cash flow estimates accordingly. This increased use of working capital is timing related, and we believe it is recoverable next fiscal year or possibly even sooner. Let me reframe fiscal '14 under more normal circumstances. This year's operating cash flow guidance is $150 million, which is depressed by the estimated working capital outflow of $140 million for the full year. Working capital flows should generally be 0 or better in a revenue-down year such as this year. With no changes in working capital, this year's operating cash flow would have been about $290 million. We've also had a number of discrete cash items this year that are nonrecurring. I'll just name a couple : about $20 million of cash losses related to Plainfield, including the accelerated interest that I'll cover in a moment; and $10 million in after-tax costs related to the separation. All of that would net to about $320 million, more indicative of normal cash flows.  Despite the issues we've seen this year, our business model still has strong cash flow dynamics. We have low capital intensity, with capital expenditures normally at or below 1% of revenues. We have no material pension obligations. And finally, Plainfield and Gradient are the last projects where we are involved in the financing. We've seized that activity well over a year ago. Based on our current capital structure, future operating cash flows should generally run 1.2 to 1.3x net income, plus or minus working capital changes or special items like asset sales. Now let me move over to some of the details on our operating segments performance in the third quarter. Health and Engineering revenues decreased $100 million or 20% year-over-year, primarily due to declining commercial health and in engineering services. We also experienced decreased unit deliveries and related maintenance of our nonintrusive inspection engineering products. Health and Engineering operating loss was $30 million for the quarter, driven by bad debt expense of a total of $43 million and an intangible impairment of $19 million. National Security Solutions revenues decreased $152 million or 13% year-over-year with an associated decrease in operating income of $12 million. The corporate operating segment had a loss of $42 million, which included planned separation transaction restructuring expenses of $25 million, $11 million to set up IT infrastructures of the 2 new companies and the remainder being normal un-allocable corporate costs.  Now let's shift gears to Plainfield for a couple of updates. In early October, we made the decision to proceed with a consensual foreclosure after the developer failed to meet its obligations in late September. We then commissioned the valuation study to determine the fair market value of the asset. At the same time, we had some cost overruns on the project and incremental closing costs related to the foreclosure. The value of the receivable adjusted for these additional costs was less than the estimated fair market value coming out of the valuation, resulting in the $33 million bad debt expense related to this project in the third quarter.  In taking ownership of the plant, we assumed $150 million of high-interest-rate debt that is due in the first half of next year. The debt includes a make-whole interest provision. We have negotiated an early payment and a discount to the make-whole and as a result, plan to pay that debt off this month, December. This will be a use of cash of about $165 million in December in our fourth quarter, which includes interest otherwise payable next fiscal year. Although uncertainty has remained, we still believe we will reach substantial completion of the Plainfield plant at December 31 of this year, less than a month from now. We have produced power at the designed level, and we have successfully connected to the grid. We expect to complete the final environmental test this week, which is the last item necessary to demonstrate substantial completion.  Finishing up, as of November 1, the company had $814 million of cash on the balance sheet, significantly above our minimum desired level of $250 million, enabling the capacity to announce the capital deployment authorization today.  With that, I'll turn it back over to John. John Jumper : Ladies and gentlemen, despite the challenging environment and our ongoing transition, we remain confident in our business that serves 3 enduring markets and confident in our employees who are dedicated to making Leidos a success. We built a strong cash flow-generating business, which we will continue to improve and optimize. Our capital deployment initiatives underscore the confidence we have in our firm commitment to drive shareholder value as we move forward. John? John Sweeney : Thanks, John, and we'd now like to open up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. Cai Von Rumohr : So can you give us a little more detail on Plainfield, you expect it to turn on by year-end, and your efforts to kind of sell the plant? Mark Sopp : Cai, this is Mark. Thanks for calling in today. We do plan to complete in December, as I just said. We're concurrently planning the materials that are appropriate for a selling process. As we indicated back in October, we plan to run the plant successfully for some period of time to demonstrate its success. After which, we expect to engage and hopefully complete the selling process sometime in the near future. Cai Von Rumohr : Okay. And it's basically producing or expected still to produce 37 megawatts? John Jumper : Cai, this is John Jumper. We -- yes, we've had it connected. We've had it up to speed, producing full power. As Stu mentioned in his remarks, we'll be doing the environmental test here in the next several days and hope to have that environmental testing complete at the end of the week, which is the last test we -- hurdle we have to pass. So everything seems to be on track for right now. K. Shea: Yes. Cai, Stu. We also have an experienced team overseeing the operation of the plant on an ongoing basis. We've contracted with NACE corporation to run the plant's daily operations. They are a highly respected experienced operator with 30 years experience doing these kinds of programs. They have a broad range of renewable technology projects, and they run 14 biomass plants, generating about 450 megawatts of power currently. Cai Von Rumohr : Okay. And then a quick one on the commercial health IT. How much were the sales down sequentially and maybe, how large were they, the size of the loss? And other companies in this space are not seeing the similar problems. Are you losing share? I mean, because Epic and Cerner have been gaining share in the space. Do you feel you're maintaining your share? John Jumper : I think, in the health, we have experienced a decline, and we did say earlier that we expected sequentially flat performance. The headwinds that, I think, we're experiencing are part of a market trend. We look at the competition, we see them, our direct competition, taking a similar hit to ours. But we were complicated by our own internal events, Cai, and that includes the melding of these 2 companies, maxIT and Vitalize, putting these 2 teams together, and we -- that was going on during the very worst of our impact from the market. So we see our direct competitors suffering somewhat from the same market trends. We -- I think we're impacted more because of the things that are now behind us that had to do with melding the 2 companies. Of note, we're looking at our new opportunity bookings for November, which were significantly up. And continuing an upward trend in December. We're not ready to say that this is an inflection point. We continue to anticipate headwinds in commercial health, but I think that we have gotten our own internal melding problems behind us. K. Shea: Yes. Cai, Stu. I think one of the other things you have to realize also is we're very different from companies like Cerner. They sell software. We do a lot of the post-sale integration. So our business is going to be a little bit following them. Operator : Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Jason Kupferberg : Just wanted to start with a high-level question. I mean, if we get a budget deal done in D.C. before the holidays, how much do you expect that would help the award and the funding environment and whole condition of sequestration for the duration of the government fiscal year? John Jumper : This is John Jumper. I -- first of all, it's hard to believe that we're going to see such a thing. But if we did, I think it would just provide a general lift and less confusion about the contracting situation we're in right now. Without the guidance that the government gives with these kinds of budget decisions, we're seeing, as Stu mentioned, our contracts being cut short, being reduced, being canceled all together, the total unexplainable behavior and unprecedented behavior we're seeing in contracting. So I think anything we would do that we would see that stabilizes the environment is going to help everyone and certainly help us out as well. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. And just a couple of questions regarding the upcoming year, building on some comments you've made in the past. I mean, first of all, with regard to the cash flow, Mark, all that detail was helpful. I mean, it sounds like what you're setting up for potentially is a very strong cash flow year in your fiscal '15, just given the pushout of some of the collections, so if you can comment on that. And then also, just comment on the 8%-plus operating margin target for fiscal '15 that I think you outlined at the analyst meeting a few months ago. Has anything changed to make you feel differently about that target? Mark Sopp : Jason, first, we're going to be providing our views on '15 in our March conference call. That's still ahead of us, and we're not going to provide any real quantitative numbers today with respect to that year. It will be interesting to see how the cards unfold in Washington in December and January to build that case. I will say, however, that when -- if our forecast is correct, that's quite a bit of drift up in days sales outstanding this year and the working capital, and we have every intention of restoring that to normative levels. And because of that, you're right, all of the things being equal, it should be a strong cash flow next year, as we revert to the norm in working capital uses. So answer to that is correct, and that is excluding extra things like should we have asset sales and so forth. But pure operating cash flow, you would generally lead to that conclusion. With respect to the 8%, again, not to give '15 forward views, but the elements that we described, the major elements in that build on September 11 are still intact. Operator : Our next question is from Joe Nadol of JPMorgan. Christopher Sands : It's actually Chris Sands on for Joe. Just general questions about how we should think about the broad outlook for revenue in the context of what you're expecting in Q4. Is it prudent to assume that could possibly be a run rate? Or can you point to discrete things that might improve that going forward? Mark Sopp : I'll start, and I think others may want to chime in. But first, Q4 is the one quarter in the year where we have less working days in our calendaring, plus we have more holidays. So that tends to be our lowest seasonal quarter of the year. So I would make an adjustment for that, and you can look at our history to probably get a pretty good ballpark of what that should be. I think all the rest is going to depend on the adjudication of our pipeline, which is significant in terms of outstanding awards and whether the sequestration and budgets stabilize or otherwise going forward. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Bill Loomis of Stifel. William Loomis : Can you just give us an update on the Gradient plant, where that stands and -- over the next couple of quarters? And I have a follow-up also. Mark Sopp : This is Mark. Gradient actually has 2 plants as originally envisioned. The first plant is very near completion and is expecting to produce power soon and provide revenues and cash flows soon. However, that plant, despite us delivering all of our deliverables as designed and on schedule, the geothermal production is not what was expected, which is more of an earth science issue. And because of that, the economics of that plant are not as robust as originally envisioned. With respect to our situation, we have $37 million of remaining receivables outstanding. We believe they are collectible. They are backed up by a number of elements to include partial guarantees from the developer. There's some money left on the construction loan, and we have some hard assets to sell related to the second plant, which was decided, after buying some equipment on our side, the developer decided to not proceed with that, given the issues with the first plant. And so that's the part of the receivable that we expect to collect through those means over the course of the next few months and be done with this project. William Loomis : Did you say $37 million? Mark Sopp : Yes, sir. William Loomis : And so that's all in a worst-case scenario? I know you think you'll get some recovery. But in a worst-case scenario, is that your ultimate liability? Or could it go further? Mark Sopp : I believe that's our ultimate exposure, $37 million. William Loomis : And whose -- in terms of the thermal work, I mean, was that your role to come up with that engineering and that science behind that? Or is there any liability behind the company that performed that analysis? Mark Sopp : It was another engineering company, not ours, not SAIC or Leidos that performed that work. So we do not have exposure on that front. William Loomis : Okay. And then that will be with Plainfield, Gradient and that's the extent of the risk on the E&C business, correct? Mark Sopp : Those are the 2 projects that had financing participation by us. John Jumper : That we're not doing anymore. William Loomis : Okay. And then the second thing, on the nonintrusive systems, was this because of Reveal or VACIS? Or can you just be a little more clear? And do you expect a big order? I know sometimes in the past you had a big quarter in the January quarter in that business. What's -- can you give some more details on that? Mark Sopp : We have some product that we had intended to shift to TSA that slipped to a variety of contracting methods, but we believe -- or issue. But we believe that is indeed a slip, so that's more on the Reveal side. That is Reveal's main customer. The rest of the VACIS business is pretty much tracking on schedule. And there are always episodic awards that we're working on to fuel the growth there, and there are a few on our pipeline today. William Loomis : So the fourth quarter, they're shipping -- they shifted here in the fourth quarter, so we'll see better sequential performance here in the fourth quarter? Mark Sopp : That is our forecast, but we have provided some risk in case that slips in our guidance. Operator : Our next question is from Arup Das of Loeb King Capital. Arup Das : Can you talk a little bit about the opportunity in OCI de-conflicted markets? I mean, you've indicated in the past that the total size of this market is $25 billion. But I was hoping we can get some insight into when we can start seeing some revenue benefit and how to think about this from a modeling perspective. Mark Sopp : Yes. Let me start on that. We really expect to see most of that benefit FY '17 and beyond. We -- what we're really focusing on today is identifying the opportunities, positioning for those opportunities through research and development and partnership, establishing our credentials and qualifications in doing so. We have an ever-increasing pipeline. We're getting more and more involved in those bids. But given the time that it takes for the gestation of those bids, we're looking several years out. I think we've been pretty consistent in saying that in the last few quarters. We do have multiple billions of dollars in our funnel today, and we have one rather significant bid that we're positioning for next fiscal year. It's a multiple billion dollars bid also. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Sonlin of Conning Assets. Stephen Sonlin : I was wondering, would you consider using additional debt to fund some of your shareholder return plans? Or are you only going to use the cash that's on hand? John Jumper : Our philosophy has been and remains, at this time, that we will use excess cash for deployments toward either buybacks and/or special dividends. So that is the case, and we do not envision, at this time using debt or incremental debt to fund that activity. Operator : I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sweeney for closing remarks. John Sweeney : Thank you, everybody, for joining us today. And we look forward to meeting with the investor community on our upcoming roadshows, and we look forward to updating you soon. Have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Leidos Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  I will now turn the call over to your host, John Sweeney, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. John Sweeney : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me today are John Jumper, our Chairman and CEO; and Mark Sopp, our CFO; and other members of the Leidos management team.  During the call, we will make forward-looking statements to assist you in the understanding of the company and our expectations about its future financial and operating performance. These statements are subject to a number of risks that could cause actual events to differ materially, and I refer you to the SEC filings for a discussion of these risks. In addition, the statements represent our views as of today. Subsequent events and developments could cause our views to change. We may elect to update the forward-looking statements at some point in the future, but we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so.  I'd now like to turn the call over to John Jumper, our Chairman and CEO. John Jumper : Thank you, John. As we look back at fiscal 2014 and into the future, it is clear that we continue to see pressure from our largest customers, including the Department of Defense, the federal government and, more recently, the intelligence community. The impact of sequestration and the resulting lack of clarity in committing funds to programs, delayed decisions and the high level of protest activity continue to weigh on our results. The results we are reporting today are consistent with the updated outlook that we shared with you in our December earnings call. Our outlook for fiscal year '15 envisions a continuation of these trends as budget outlays lag appropriations and uncertainty dominates significant decisions about the debt ceiling, complicated by the implementation of health care legislation.  Nevertheless, we remain positive about our prospects for the future, and we have good reason to be optimistic. Our strategy is designed to drive the real value of Leidos as a company that can continue to return substantial value to our shareholders. This strategy incorporates the following factors : first, we are focused on driving organic growth; second, we are capitalizing on new markets, where we have demonstrated capacity that were previously restricted by organizational conflicts of interest; third, we are identifying businesses that are not core to our strategy and appropriately narrowing our portfolio; fourth, we continue to focus on our low capital intensity to ensure continued strong cash generation; and finally, we are on a journey of continuous improvement to streamline processes and drive efficiencies. This philosophy is the new norm at Leidos.  We serve rich markets in national security, Health and Engineering. Our skills in these markets are valued by our customers and critical to all aspects of life, family, community, the nation and the world. The promise of Leidos is to leverage our technology skills to the benefit of all markets we serve with an efficient business model that emphasizes shareholder value. We continue to transfer technology across our 3 markets, as we discussed on the Investors' Day. One area where we are beginning to see strong potential is providing cybersecurity services to the Health and Engineering markets. Our combination of domain knowledge in Health and Engineering, together with our exceptionally deep end-to-end competency in cyber is beginning to pay off. Although still in the early stages, we are providing cyber support to 8 clients in the health and energy market. This technology sharing across markets is a key differentiator for us. Another area where we are leveraging technology is in smart grid. Leidos engineering recently received 3 awards in our Smart Grid as a Service offering, where small utilities can gain the benefits of digitized meters as a service rather than a capital investment. With these awards, Leidos will be providing Smart Grid as a Service to over 50,000 meters in Colorado and South Carolina. Leidos was recently named as Smart Grid Company to Watch by SmartGridNews.com. I'd also like to add the point that the separation we completed back in September was envisioned as a way to unlock value, and we believe we are on the right track. In addition to expanding our addressable market, we are unlocking value to our capital allocation program, and I'd like to remind all of you that over the past year, we have returned substantial capital to our shareholders in 3 ways : first, a recurring dividend currently carrying approximately 3% yield; a -- second, a roughly $350 million special dividend we paid in June of last year; and third, the $20 million share repurchase authorization announced last December, under which we've already executed a $300 million accelerated share repurchase. This repurchase constituted about 8% of float, and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders remains steadfast.  Turning now to our National Security Solutions segment. Revenues decreased $156 million or 14% over -- year-over-year in the fourth quarter. The revenue decline was primarily attributable to 3 factors : first, the drawdown of overseas military forces or OCO revenues of $65 million, including the Joint Logistics Integration, or JLI, program; second, completion of several intelligence contracts; and the remainder generally driven by the reduction of spending due to a declining U.S. government budget. Segment operating income increased by $1 million year-over-year, and operating margin was strong at 8.8% for the quarter. This was fueled by cost reductions, solid program performance and some favorable fee adjustments with offset -- which offset the overall impact of the revenue decline. As part of our portfolio-shaping initiatives, we have decided to sell CloudShield, our cyber hardware business. Our cyber strategy has evolved more towards the agility offered by software-based solutions as opposed to hardware. We believe that leveraging our strength as an agile software integrator and our deep domain knowledge of cybersecurity threats and response tools gives us the greatest opportunity to drive growth with government and commercial customers. Overall, we continue to make good progress in the cyber market, and we're awarded a new $80 million contract in Q4 with the intelligence community for cyber protection.  Our National Security Solutions new bookings for the quarter were $278 million, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.3 for the fourth quarter and 0.8 for the full fiscal year. Award activity out of the government was light in the fourth quarter compared to a strong book-to-bill of 1.8 we had in the third quarter. We continue to make progress in assessing markets previously restricted by organizational conflicts of interest, winning over $100 million of new contracts in command and control from the U.S. Army CECOM since the close of the fourth quarter. We were previously restricted from bidding on these types of programs before the separation from SAIC due to OCI limitations. These programs were identified before the split. So it's gratifying to see some early-stage progress in this area. In addition, the wins represent increases in addressable market share, and this was a driver around the separation to begin with. Lou von Thaer and his team are making good progress in continuing to develop the pipeline of new opportunities enabled from the separation. Our organic growth pursuits also includes some new and significant opportunities in the logistics and international areas. These opportunities have been carefully selected to leverage existing relationships and past performance credentials, where we can compete successfully and deliver confident returns.  Now on to Health and Engineering. Health and Engineering revenues decreased by $129 million or 27% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. The revenue contraction reflects 3 main drivers : first, the completion of 2 alternative energy power plant construction projects that reduced government engineering revenues; second, commercial health declines, partially driven by lower hospital IT spending, a function of lower Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements as a result of sequestration; and third, lower security product revenues mainly due to timing of shipments and the completion of large systems maintenance contracts. Health and Engineering operating income decreased $14 million in the fourth quarter, a result of lower revenue volume, charges of $4 million associated with legal settlement and transaction expenses and startup costs associated with the Plainfield biomass power plant of an additional $4 million.  Our Health and Engineering business has a segment book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 for the quarter and 0.9 for the full year. We had some good wins in the quarter, including a 4 -- a $242 million multiple award ID/IQ for the National Guard Bureau and 3 additional contracts with a total bid value of $83 million for LSB Industries. Our backlog was $1.85 billion, similar to Q3 levels, and an increase in funded backlog as a proportion of the total. Looking at our total company business development results, consolidated net bookings totaled $623 million in the fourth quarter and produced a book-to-bill ratio of 0.5. Our fourth quarter book-to-bill has historically been a lower level than the remainder of the year, but this year followed a very strong Q3. For the full fiscal year, our book-to-bill was 0.9, which is more indicative of a larger -- of a longer-term trend. We ended the quarter with a $9.3 billion in total backlog, $3 billion of which was funded. Before I turn the call over to Mark for his financial review, I'd like to take a minute to discuss 2 upcoming changes to management that we recently announced. The first is my own decision to retire from the CEO position. I came to this position to lead the company through the transformation we needed to configure ourselves for the future. With that separation complete, it's now time to transition to new leadership that can take Leidos to the next level of technical accomplishment and efficient execution. As we announced, I will continue in my role as Chairman of the Board and assist in the transition to the new CEO. The Board of Directors has initiated a formal search process that includes both internal and external candidates for the position. In the meantime, I remain in charge and fully engaged. We are pressing ahead with our schedule for strategy development in our initiatives for continued -- continuous improvement.  Another important transition that will be taking place in the next few days is with our President and COO, Stu Shea. Stu's superb work in leading and implementing the separation of former SAIC into Leidos and new SAIC is now complete. At the same time, his focus on improving the operational ecosystem of Leidos has produced clear benefits, which are embedded in the business. Consequently, Stu, the Board of Directors and I have mutually agreed that now is the time for Stu to pursue new interests beyond Leidos. The board and the entire management team recognizes Stu's valuable contribution to Leidos, and we all wish him well in his new endeavors.  With that, I'll now turn it over to Mark, who will discuss the financials and outline our expectations for fiscal 2015. Mark Sopp : Thank you, John. I'll call your attention to the Q4 earnings presentation on our website to augment my remarks. Earlier, John focused on the segments, so I'll cover the consolidated view.  As John indicated, fourth quarter results were consistent with the guidance set forth in our last earnings call in December. Consolidated revenues were $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter, which represented a decline of 18% year-over-year for the reasons John covered earlier. Our fourth quarter operating margin was 6.3%. This reflected some non-recurring items, including the last round of separation costs of $7 million. Excluding just the separation costs, the operating margin was 6.9% for Q4. Interest expense was $24 million in the quarter, higher than our norm of $20 million due to interest related to debt we assumed on Plainfield, which was retired as planned in the quarter. In addition, the $11 million of other expenses reflected the early extinguishment fees also related to retiring this debt. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.56 for Q4. Operating cash flows were strong at about $110 million for the fourth quarter. Days sales outstanding finished at 76 days. Financing outflows were significant as expected, with $300 million used from accelerated share repurchase and $150 million used to retire the Plainfield debt. With all of that, we exited fiscal '14 with $430 million of cash on hand, with sufficient excess cash to continue the deployment strategy John mentioned earlier.  On Slide 16 of our earnings presentation today, we are showing a reconciliation of our calculation of non-GAAP EPS. Non-GAAP EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding impairment charges, special charges related to Plainfield and costs related to the separation. We are doing this to provide more clarity and consistency in reporting our core ongoing results, and we will continue to do so going forward.  Moving on to guidance. For fiscal '15, which started on February 1, we will be providing annual guidance, updated as appropriate, on a quarterly basis. We will guide on revenues, non-GAAP EPS and operating cash flow. For fiscal '15, we expect revenues in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion, a contraction rate of 11% to 15%. This reflects ongoing reductions expected in discretionary Department of Defense outlays, which we believe is in the minus 10% range. We're also contemplating a more accelerated reduction in our support work for military and intelligence activities in the Middle East, exacerbated by the inability of the U.S. and Afghanistan to negotiate a security agreement. Our guidance contemplates roughly 4% to 6% points of revenue contraction from this area alone. For our commercial business areas, our guidance contemplates relatively flat revenues compared to our current Q4 run rates. In terms of timing from a sequential perspective, we expect the first quarter of fiscal '15 to be relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter just ended and fairly flat sequentially after that for the rest of the year. From a year-over-year perspective, this would result in a double-digit contraction rate in the first 2 quarters, with improvement as we move through the year primarily due to easing in prior-year comparisons. Our expectations for operating margin implied in our guidance range is in the low- to mid-7% range. While margins will benefit from portfolio changes and significant cost reductions, we need to see higher revenue volumes in order to confidently meet our 8% plus target. Plainfield is also restraining profitability. While the plant is expected to run cash positive, we expect to report operating losses in the first half of fiscal '15 due to heavy depreciation and start-up costs. Also, from a timing perspective, our higher-margin security products business will have lower sales at the start of the year, with more shipments weighted towards the third and fourth quarters. The second half increase is primarily related to a foreign government sale booked in fiscal '14. In addition, the benefit from our ongoing cost reductions are expected to increase as we move through fiscal '15. These factors will collectively drive a higher margin in the second half of the year compared to the first half.  As for other P&L items, in fiscal '15, we expect interest expense to be approximately $80 million for the year, evenly spread through the year at $20 million per quarter. All debt is at fixed rate and with no maturities for several years. We expect our effective tax rate to be about 36%, up compared to fiscal '14, which had benefited from tax deductions related to the special dividend. With that, we expect fiscal '15 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.55. Our guidance anticipates a $0.10 benefit from share buybacks that we currently expect to make during fiscal '15, continuing our stated capital deployment strategy. We'll share details on any specific completed buyback actions when appropriate.  For fiscal '15 operating cash flows, we are expecting at least $350 million. This contemplates reducing our DSOs to a more normative low 70s. Cash flow maximization is, of course, a high priority. Also, while Plainfield had a significant drag on operating cash flow in fiscal '14, the planned proceeds from the Treasury cash grant and/or from selling the plant in fiscal '15 will show up in cash flows from investing activities.  Finishing up on dividends. Last week, our board approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share to a record date of April 15 and a payment date of April 30.  Now back over to John for his closing remarks. John Jumper : Thank you, Mark. Now that the separation is behind us, we are working on getting out the Leidos name, and our branding efforts are continuing to gain momentum. We recently announced that we are the presenting sponsor of D.C. United, the most storied franchise in Major League Soccer. The Leidos logo is now prominently featured on the front of the team's jersey, displayed throughout the stadium and all of the team's marketing and media properties. The surge in the sport's popularity offered a unique opportunity for Leidos to reach a diverse and growing fan base and to build brand recognition, ultimately helping to drive our business forward. I believe that Leidos, with its team of remarkable employees, is well positioned to face the uncertainties of FY '15. We have a better understanding of where challenges are in the current government budget environment, as well as our commercial markets, and the steps we need to take to maximize the opportunities for Leidos. We are a solid cash flow generator, and we remain steadfast in our commitment to return value to shareholders.  Now I'll turn it back over to John Sweeney for your questions. John Sweeney : Thanks, John. Now operator, we'd like to open for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen. Cai Von Rumohr : So John, with the CEO search, what is your plan to stay on? What -- how long do you intend to remain as Chairman? And how, also, are you dealing with the plan to kind of find a new exec to run HECS? John Jumper : Cai, excellent question. I need to make sure that you understand and everybody understands that we're -- I'm fully in charge here and we'll continue to be fully in charge. My intention is to stay in place until a successor is chosen. The board has a formal search going on that includes both internal and external candidates. And as you know, I plan to stay on as Chairman of the Board, help with the transition, and I'll stay as long as I am needed. So there is not going to be any leadership vacuum as we press on forward. We're dealing with the continuous improvement, we're dealing with the strategy and implementation, and we're making sure that the right leadership is in place and in charge. Cai Von Rumohr : Okay. And then maybe if you could give us some additional color on some of the moving parts at HECS, specifically the rollout of order trends in commercial health, IT, the outlook going forward for the VACIS products business, those key drivers? John Jumper : Well, I think, Cai, that we're taking the steps to move forward. The leadership, first of all, in Health and Engineering remains the same. So Steve Comber is in place, in charge of the health business as the Group President, as he's always been; Jim Moos, who's the Group President of the engineering business, as he's always been. In the security products business, we're -- got a new foreign order that we have received, that we think will increase our revenues as the year goes on. The -- and the other part of the security products business, we completed a maintenance contract in Iraq that was successfully completed. And the thing that's still pending that we've talked to you about before is the TSA product orders, which are still pending. TSA has not moved on that, but as we've said before, there's about 2,000 machines out there that we know that TSA has to replace at some time, and we're well positioned to be very competitive for that. So that's, I think, a snapshot going forward. Cai Von Rumohr : Terrific. And just one last one. Could you give us some color on what you're seeing in terms of potential bookings and the potential pattern of bookings over the next couple of months in the NSS space? John Jumper : Let me let Lou Von Thaer, who's here with us, handling that sector, President, answer that Cai. Lou Von Thaer : Cai, so over the next few months, I think we have to understand these things have been very spotty. While we are seeing some increased attention from our customers and talking about restarting some of the programs that have been slowed down, we really haven't seen RFPs come out yet for those. It's going to take some time for the DoD and intel communities to gear back up to let in some of these contracts. We did have a good first month and -- of the new year, and we will continue to keep a close eye on where the backlogs and bookings build. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Robert Spingarn : John, forgive me for asking the question in this way, but when a company changes management, often it does that before restructures and updates its strategy, and Leidos -- I guess what parent SAIC or predecessor SAIC has kind of gone it in the opposite direction. And we still see pressure from a combination of, let's call it, end-market softness, both on the NSS and on the HECS side, restructuring, maybe executions at play here as well. And this doesn't seem to have bottomed yet. And then with new leadership coming in, why wouldn't this process of, let's call it, strategic disruption continue further into the future if that new leadership wants to reevaluate things? John Jumper : Well, Robert, first of all -- I think first of all, my -- it was my decision to retire and to turn the -- transition the company into new leadership that can, I think, continue to drive efficiency and performance to the next level. And I think that in the Health and Engineering sector, I think that the move we made there has actually resulted in better leadership, and we're starting to see signs of better performance there. In Stu's case, it was just a mutual decision. We've been through a heck of a lot with this separation. We've had a lot of restructuring, as you say, a lot of management attention to the restructuring. And to me, the timing seems right to make these -- get these changes behind us, get us out of the way. We've got the configuration of the company the right way and just to take advantage of this time to configure ourselves for the future. And that's what's led to these decisions. Robert Spingarn : So should I take from that that your selection of incoming -- of an incoming CEO, that that person will essentially buy into what you have here and will not be expected to make changes themselves? John Jumper : Well, we are not going to preempt any decisions that a new CEO might want to make, for sure, but I will say that we are on a course with the strategy, and we have a strategy development process that is in works. It's in the -- it's being built right now and certainly, a new leadership will have a say in that. But we've also got the Board of Directors involved, and we have the rest of the management team involved in this. So you never take away the ability of whoever might be in charge to alter those things, but essentially, we have policies in place that the board has been a part of. And while there could be some change, we expect to be at least somewhat consistent in that going forward. Robert Spingarn : Okay. And then a more specific question, either for Lou or for Mark. But you did have nice margins at NSS, and I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the mix there and how maybe some of the fall-off in the Middle East business or something else is at work, and how we might think about the 2 large segments -- this part, I guess, is for Mark. But from a segment perspective, how should we think about your guidance for fiscal '15? Lou Von Thaer : Well, Robert, I'll start with that. This is Lou. From an NSS side, we had a very strong quarter, and I think it's related to a couple of items. One is, I think, we've gotten a few of the program execution challenges that we had a couple of quarters ago behind us. The team is really starting to come together and hit on all cylinders and perform much better. We also had some onetime issues that -- some onetime write-ups that helped us in the quarter to raise the earnings a little bit higher than probably where normal points are. We had talked, back in the Investor Day, about an 8% return going forward on NSS, and I think we still see that going forward at a segment level as we look at the mix and as we look at the programs and capabilities that we have right now on the portfolio and also with the cost-cutting. We're going to continue cost-cutting through the year and expect our returns to improve slightly as we walk through the year to get to around that 8% number. The biggest challenge we have is that number would probably be higher, but we are seeing the volumes come down, as you've heard in Mark's guidance, and that's going to continue to put some pressure, but I believe we can keep up with it and be close to that 8% range. Mark Sopp : And Rob, on the Health and Engineering side, well, that's been more volatile, as one might expect, than lose national security business in the fourth quarter. HECS did 5.4% margin. They had about 300 basis points of erosion from legal costs and Plainfield set-up costs and some low utilization in the health area. So that brings them above 8% if you adjust for those, well above 8% in the quarter. That's overall low utilization and, as John said, pretty low security product shipments in the fourth quarter as well, which we expect to see really start to build in the second half of '15. So provided we keep our utilization in check and avoid some of the non-recurring items, both legally, Plainfield setup, et cetera, well positioned for the segment for HECS to do 8% and above going forward, with the attendant risk that come with that on volume, and that's why we set the guidance, we think, at an appropriate conservative level. Robert Spingarn : And just on that $5 billion, how should that shake out the 2 segments? Mark Sopp : It's $3.5 billion plus on the NSS side and $1.5 billion, ballpark, for HES. Robert Spingarn : So this last quarter is really a trough there in that sense, hopefully, at -- in -- at HEC in terms of the run rate? Mark Sopp : Well, we are expecting lift from some of the design -- well, not design build, but the LSB program is the major driver for growth there. The fourth quarter is also again with holidays and so forth, a pretty low number for the labor-oriented health business, and we certainly are hoping to see some improvement there as well to get through '15. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Amit Singh : This is Amit Singh for Jason. Just wondering if you could talk about the cash flows. I believe last quarter, you said that you expect fiscal '15 to be sort of a catch-up in payments here because of the government shutdown last year and all the delayed payments. So as we look through your guidance for the year, are you -- is that catch-up in payment happening? And then previously, you had provided the $400 million plus per year of guidance. So if you look beyond fiscal '15, is that still achievable? Mark Sopp : Thanks, Amit. This is Mark here. Sorry for my voice. With respect to recovery of the working capital outflows from '14, our guidance for '15 -- well, first of all, let me say that we covered about $40 million of that $100 million plus from '14 in our fourth quarter. So we did a little bit better on DSOs than our guidance for '14 had anticipated. So some of that is behind us in the Treasury to be deployed. For '15, we're expecting at least a $50 million recovery of that implied in our guidance. We certainly will aim to do more and continue to strive to have our DSOs march downward, but in light of providing guidance, we make sure -- to make sure we can hit, we've applied $50 million and we'll keep going after that. With respect to the $400 million provided at the IR Day, the bottom line is the volumes we now see in the business are substantially less than what we were envisioning on that date. We point to the intelligence business. We thought we'd be more resilient in our mindset at that point, what we saw in late September, October. And as Lou said here today, there seemed just as many cuts there in intelligence as we are for overall defense. We also have to be more cautious on the overseas activities funded by OCO accounts for the reasons set forth earlier in our remarks. And so the volumes themselves comprise about a $75 million reduction in both revenues and margins from the number implied in that $400 million. So that will take some time to recover in the years ahead, but the ultimate cash flow metrics of the company in terms of capital intensity and so forth remain the same, and it's really about improving the volumes and the margins going forward. Amit Singh : Okay, great. And just a quick update, and I know you spoke earlier of -- about this on the call. The revenue synergies that are originally planned before the split, the $1 billion between the original SAIC and Leidos, is there any update on the time line for that? I know it started off as 3 year-ish. So where do you think and how long do you think it's going to take to realize those synergies? Lou Von Thaer : So this is Lou, Amit. I'll take that one. I can't speak for the synergies on the new SAIC side, but on our side, we are starting to see some benefits from that. We're clearly bidding more work. John talked earlier of a couple of wins that we had in the last quarter that contribute to that. I'd really rather not give details because it's a little hard to predict right now, but we do have some OCI uplift in the plan for 2015. We expect that to grow through the next few years. I think, realistically, a 2-year plan to have $1 billion, this is probably too optimistic though, and we're going to see a little bit slower growth in that. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Christopher Sands : It's actually Chris Sands on for Joe. I wanted to follow up on Cai's question about the components of Health and Engineering, specifically the scanners. Even with the second half pick-up, do you still think that will be a year-over-year headwind? Mark Sopp : Could you clarify revenue question, margin question, please? Christopher Sands : Well, the first part was revenue, and then I wanted to follow up with margin as well. Do you see contraction on the scanners year-over-year? Mark Sopp : I'll start with that one. Maybe John will augment, but generally speaking, with the international order we have, that business is relatively flat from a revenue perspective, full year-over-year. Although as I tried to say a moment ago, the fourth quarter by itself that we're coming off of was pretty low relative to the full year run rate we expect for '15, and therefore, some marginal lift as we move forward. The overall margins of that business are very strong -- remains strong. The mix has changed a little bit. It's a little bit more product-oriented versus maintenance from the completion of the maintenance activities in the Middle East, and that has had a slight erosion of margins amidst a very favorable overall story relative to the portfolio. So the business still contributes in a very strong fashion to the margin performance of the company, and that will remain in '15. Christopher Sands : Great. And then on commercial health, will -- what kind of margin pickup do you envision year-over-year there, if any? Mark Sopp : From a year-over-year perspective, we are expecting margin improvement. We did incur some integration costs for maxIT and Vitalize in the predominant first half of the year, and we continue to take cost out through a variety of efforts during '14. And so assuming a stable business, hopefully a growing business, we would expect margins to improve meaningfully year-over-year as a result of the synergies of the 2 being together and the cost reductions we've made. John Jumper : Let me add to that by saying that in addition to the turbulence of the separation of the company and at the same time we were doing the integration of maxIT and Vitalize, it's the same time that the market was hit with a significant down cycle. So we are through the integration anxieties of maxIT and Vitalize. We have a team in place that is, I think, very well prepared to deal with the market realities. And so this just adds to what Mark was saying about the fact that we're seeing good signs that that commercial health business is stabilizing, and we're optimistic in the overall health business about our prospects for being competitive on this new Department of Defense contract to replace their electronic health care records system, being a multibillion opportunity. We think we're very well positioned with our combination of federal and commercial health expertise there. So that just adds to Mark's remarks. Christopher Sands : And do you have a sense of timing for when that award may come? John Jumper : The -- I don't think that the award is going to be in this FY. I think we've got a -- RFIs that roll out in 3 phases, but I don't know if there's a date set for the award or not. We can get back to you on that. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Bill Loomis with Stifel. William Loomis : Just going back to the commercial health care business. What gives you confidence? It sounds like that's bottoming, but, of course, obviously, you thought the same last September. What's -- in terms -- as regards to specific hospital agreements or specific awards you can to talk to about, why you feel comfortable that business is turning -- or bottoming, I should say? John Jumper : Well, I think stabilizing is the right word to use. That's the way we're thinking about it. I think it's mainly because we have the right team in place. We've got a lot of new members in the -- on the commercial health side. And the way they measure progress in that business, it's a very short cycle. A lot of that business is very short cycle. So they measure opportunities and win rate. So we have increasing funnel of opportunities and an increasing win rate at the same time that's taking place right now. Again, I don't want to be overly opportunistic on this, but this is contributing to our belief that the situation is stabilizing. We've got good partnership in Canada with the win there that is really a part of a hospital system rather than a single hospital itself. And we've still got the same large bucket of individual hospitals as the customer set that we had from the beginning, and that's a fairly large number, and then these pending regulatory events that go along with Affordable Care Act that we think is going to add to our prospects as well. So it all sort of adds up and is the reason for us to be mildly optimistic at this point. William Loomis : Okay. But there's still not -- it's not like you have -- like in the government business, longer-term visibility. It's taking that kind of month-by-month on that? John Jumper : Yes, actually, that's correct. We're continuing with what we said that we expect to see some of these headwinds that we saw in the third and fourth quarter carry into the first part of this fiscal year and -- but performance-wise, these are good signs that I'm talking about. William Loomis : Well, on the commercial energy business, what's been the new contracts out? You mentioned smart grid, but in terms of the larger dollar programs, what has been the success here since you've decided not to do fixed-price build and construct? How many cost-type wins have you had since you made that decision? John Jumper : Yes, Bill, well, I think you emphasized the point that we're not using the balance sheet to finance these things anymore. That's a major point, but the major one is this contract we have with LSB that I think it's about $85 million that we've been awarded so far, with prospects of significantly more. So that's the one that -- that's the big one that we have right now. We were able to use the credentials that we've -- that we wanted to be able to use in some of the previous projects that we had to put those to work, and I think that's the kind of thing that we want more of in the future. William Loomis : And just to be clear on Plainfield, can you tell us how much -- when do you -- what the sale process that is, maybe a pretty big range, what the cash proceeds could be in timing on when you sell that plant? John Jumper : Let me let Mark address that. Mark Sopp : Well, as we said all along, we want to prove successful plant operations for a sustainable period of time to put us in the position to maximize value for shareholders, and so that will be some time ahead of us. And we'll monitor that when we feel that condition has been set. With respect to the overall value, the carrying value on the books is roughly $275 million, of which the Treasury cash grant is roughly $70 million of that amount. So the net of that is, in essence, the carrying value that we have to achieve, and we're going to do everything we can with respect to the plant operations and the selling process to make sure we maximize value for shareholders at the end of the day. William Loomis : Could it be a fiscal '15 event? Mark Sopp : I would say it's possible, but I would not bank it on it at this point given the selling process could take some time and they've got Hart-Scott-Rodino involved and all of that as well, so if possible, but also do consider it could easily leak into fiscal '16. William Loomis : Okay. And just one real quick one. The $243 million National Guard contract win, ID/IQ, did you include that value impact in your contract awards? John Jumper : Good question, just a second. I do not think we did. Yes. I don't think we did, no. Operator : I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to John Sweeney for closing remarks. John Sweeney : Thank you, everybody, for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you as we move through fiscal '15. Thank you, and have a good day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect, and everyone, have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  I will now turn the call over to your host, John Sweeney, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. John Sweeney : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our first quarter fiscal 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today are John Jumper, our Chairman and CEO; and Mark Sopp, our CFO; and other members of the Leidos management team.  During the call, we'll make forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding the company and our expectations about its future financial and operating performance. These statements are subject to a number of risks that could cause actual events to differ materially, and I refer you to our SEC filings for a discussion of these risks. In addition, statements represent our views as of today. Subsequent events and developments could cause our view to change. We may elect to update the forward-looking statements at some point in the future, but we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so.  I'd now like to turn the call over to John Jumper, our Chairman and CEO. John Jumper : Thank you, John. Our first quarter results for fiscal year '15 and our second full quarterly reports since the separation reflect the continuing challenges we face in our various markets while also demonstrating some positive results from our actions to improve operational performance. We continue to make meaningful progress on mitigating the impact of government spending levels and shedding impediments to our future growth. We are cautiously optimistic about recent contract activity in some segments of the federal market, federal health in particular. However, our outlook and our experience in defense and intelligence budgets show outlays continuing to decrease through the government's fiscal year '15. We also believe that dramatic differences and priorities between political parties may result in another continuing resolution in the upcoming new government fiscal year, which starts October 1 of this year. Leidos continues to take actions necessary to become more competitive in both federal and commercial markets. I remain convinced that we're doing a good job, improving upon these areas within our control and that we are extracting the value we envisioned in the separation.  We saw our National Security Sector operating income improved, as well as an increase in the sector's funded backlog. And we continued on our journey to shape and optimize our portfolio, completing the sale of CounterBomber, our third divestiture in recent months. We also had success in our efforts to access markets that were either partially or fully conflicted before the separation, seeing strong new awards amounting to more than $400 million in airborne systems, command and control, and logistics. In addition, we have taken initial steps to build our international presence with both government and commercial business where we see demand for our demonstrated solutions. These steps are being taken in a small number of countries, where we have existing footprint, relationships and past performance credentials.  In the area of capital deployment, we substantially completed a $200 million accelerated share repurchase program announced in March. As we have said, our goal is to avoid building excess cash in our balance sheet as we move forward. In the last 6 months, we have returned over $0.5 billion through our share repurchase program, and this represents about 17% of our current market cap. Our cash generation is typically lower in the first quarter, as our results show. That said, cash generation remains a clear priority for Leidos, and we remain committed to utilizing our expected strong cash flows to drive value for our shareholders.  Now turning to our National Security Sector. Revenues decreased by $133 million, or 12% year-over-year, in the first quarter of FY '15. This represents a slight improvement in the rate of decline compared to the fourth quarter of last year. About $78 million of the decline was due to the continued reduction of U.S. overseas war-related, or OCO, business. We continue to expect that OCO-related revenues will be about $400 million in fiscal 2015, down from close to $750 million in fiscal 2014. We believe that we will eventually be able to turn about half of the remaining business into programs of record. It is our expectation that we continue to see a moderation in the rate of decline for our National Security Sector revenues as we move through the remainder of the fiscal 2015, mainly driven by easing comparisons. Our National Security Sector operating income increased by $6 million to $77 million in the first quarter of FY '15. Our operating income margin was 8.2% for the quarter, up 160 basis points compared to the prior year. The improved margin performance reflects the ongoing impact of our cost reduction initiatives and solid program execution.  I am pleased to note that these initiatives more than offset the overall impact of revenue decline.  National Security Sector net bookings for the quarter were $474 million, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of just over 0.5. Our funded backlog increased by 6% year-over-year and grew 7% on a sequential basis. One notable recent win was the Combatant Craft Medium contract, a specialized vessel for the U.S. Special Operations Command. We have been pursuing this program for several years, winning an aggressive competition to develop and field initial units using our vessel design and unique capabilities and leveraging the commercial shipbuilding supplier base. This win further solidifies our competitiveness in the DoD solutions space. Now on to Health and Engineering. Health and Engineering revenues decreased by $141 million, or 27% year-over-year. The revenue contraction reflects 4 main factors : first, the completion of 2 alternative energy power plant construction projects, Plainfield and Gradient, which boosted revenues by $63 million in the prior-year period; second, the timing of security product shipments. In the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we had a relatively low level of shipments due to the completion of a large international systems maintenance contract last year and due to our schedule for delivery of new security product shipments, which are concentrated in the remaining quarters of this year. Third, while we saw a sequential improvement in our commercial health revenues for the first quarter, we experienced a decline on a year-over-year basis. And finally, we had fewer new starts in our design-build engineering business. Overall, we believe our Health and Engineering revenues will build modestly as we move through the rest of the year, driven largely by higher levels of security product deliveries.  Health and Engineering operating income decreased $10 million in the first quarter, a result of the lower revenue volume, the low volume of security product deliveries and operating losses associated with the Plainfield biomass power plant. Excluding any unforeseen items, we would anticipate our sector operating income to increase as we move through the rest of the year, driven primarily by the expected increased volume in security product shipments in the remaining quarters and an improvement in the results from Plainfield operations.  Our Health and Engineering business had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0. Total backlog for this sector was $1.85 billion, up 5% compared to the prior year, while the funding backlog was $1.12 billion, up slightly year-over-year.  Looking at our total company business development results, consolidated net bookings totaled $857 million for the first quarter and produced a book-to-bill ratio of 0.65. We ended the quarter with $8.8 billion in total backlog, $3.1 billion of which was funded. Total company backlog was down 6% year-over-year, while funded backlog was up 5% over that period. The value of bids outstanding at the first -- at the end of the first quarter was $11.9 billion. Finally, before I turn the call over to Mark, I'd like to give you a quick update on the board's ongoing CEO search. We have identified a number of excellent candidates, both internal and external. The board is devoting considerable attention to the interview process, and I am optimistic that we'll be in a position to conclude the process in the near future.  With that, I'll now turn it over to Mark, who will discuss the financials and the outlook for the rest of the year. Mark Sopp : Great. Thank you, John. Consolidated revenues were $1.3 billion for the first quarter, which represented a decline of 17% year-over-year and consistent with our expectations. Operating income margin was 6.7%. This is below our full year expectation of a low- to mid-7% range due to a higher-than-anticipated loss on our Plainfield energy plant operations and the timing of severance- and regulatory-related charges in our corporate sector. At the same time, I'd like to highlight progress on improving our margin profile. Our National Security Sector posted a margin of 8.2% in Q1, benefiting from strong program execution, and we generally expect this level of performance throughout the year. Our Health and Engineering Sector operating income margin was 6.6% in Q1, depressed by the Plainfield results and by low sales volume of our higher-margin security products, as John said. We expect improvement in these 2 areas for the rest of the year. These factors together drove operating income of $89 million for Q1 and a year-over-year improvement of 17% despite a reduction in revenues.  Interest expense was $20 million in the quarter, tracking to our expected normalized level for the year. Our share buybacks reduced our diluted shares outstanding to 78 million, down from 84 million in the fourth quarter of last year. This should adjust down to 75 million to 76 million in Q2 as we get a full quarter's benefit from the $200 million buyback we launched in March. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.59 for the first quarter, and our non-GAAP EPS was $0.60 per share, which excludes $1 million of separation and restructuring expenses stemming from an adjustment to a reserve for facilities' lease terminations.  Operating cash flow was negative $8 million in Q1. The first quarter, as John said, is typically the low point for cash flow generation as we have one extra payroll cycle, and we also pay all annual incentives in the first quarter. We exited the quarter with $183 million of cash on hand.  Now moving on to guidance. Today, we are reaffirming our fiscal '15 guidance for all measures, revenues, non-GAAP diluted EPS and operating cash flow, as we laid out on our last earnings call in March. Our fiscal '15 revenue expectation continues to be in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. In terms of timing, from a sequential perspective, we expect revenues in the remaining quarters to be modestly below the result in Q1. This is primarily driven by ongoing reductions in revenues from our support of overseas contingency operations, OCO, and overall DoD and intelligence community budget cuts. Our expectation for operating margin implied in our guidance range continues to be in the low- to mid-7% range. We expect operating losses from Plainfield to be reduced in Q2 and contribute modestly to profitability in the second half. I will note we anticipate Plainfield to contribute positively to operating cash flow for the year due to favorable tax benefits associated with the biomass plant. Also, as noted earlier, our higher-margin security products business is scheduled to ramp up in the remaining quarters. In addition, we expect to benefit from further cost reductions. These factors are expected collectively to drive higher margin for the remaining quarters compared to Q1.  As for other P&L items, there are also no changes to our original guidance. We continue to expect interest expense to be approximately $80 million for the year and our effective tax rate to be roughly 36%. With that, we expect fiscal '15 non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.55. Our guidance does not include the impact of any potential future share repurchases in the year.  For fiscal '15 operating cash flows, we expect at least $350 million. This contemplates recovery from working capital outflows in Q1 and further working capital reductions of $50 million, as we set forth in our original guidance, as we work through the rest of the year. In addition to our operating cash flow outlook for the rest of the year, we anticipate that the proceeds from the Plainfield cash grant will be received in the latter half of fiscal '15, showing up in cash flows from investing activities and further adding to our cash deployment potential. Finishing up on the topic of capital deployment, our strategy is unchanged. As a reminder, our first priority on the deployment front is to maintain or increase our regular quarterly dividend. For excess cash, which we define as amounts above $200 million of cash on hand, our strategy is to deploy it to maximize shareholder returns. Given our $350 million operating cash flow outlook and the expected net inflows from investing activities, we anticipate generating significant, deployable excess cash as we progress through the year.  Now I'll turn it back over to John for his closing remarks. John Jumper : Thank you, Mark. As we report our second full quarter of performance under the Leidos banner, I have watched a resilient management team and a talented team of employees take on multiple challenges, sequestration, government shutdown, a new company name and significant structural change. I am confident we are positioned better than ever to take on the uncertainties of our environment and to deliver to our shareholders the value that was envisioned when we created Leidos.  Now let me turn the mic back over to John for your questions. John Sweeney : Thank you. Operator, we'd now like to open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen. Cai Von Rumohr : Could you give us a little color on the tone of bookings at NSS? Some of your peers have indicated they've started to see a pickup. And maybe quantify for us -- you were down $78 million in OCO volume, how big was it in that first quarter? John Jumper : Cai, this is John Jumper. We've got Lou Von Thaer here with us today as part of the management team. So I'm going to let him field that question. Lou Von Thaer : Cai, so we -- $78 million was our first quarter impact on order -- on revenues being down from the actual OCO. A lot of this comes with timing, and if you look at our submittals for the quarter, they were a little bit lower in the first quarter. But in the next couple of quarters, we have a couple billion-dollar-plus bids that we expect to go out that have been delayed. These things will all settle out in time, and we actually expect to see our submittal numbers increase quite a bit. If you look back over the last couple of years, with the government budget challenges, we've seen most of the awards come through in what would be our third quarter, and we anticipate that will happen again this year. Cai Von Rumohr : And then to my first question, the other question about the level of OCO revenues in the first quarter? Mark Sopp : Cai, this is Mark. We're still on pace to have roughly $400 million for the year. It will modestly decline as we move through the year with some scheduled ramp-downs, but that overall $400 million expectation for the year is unchanged from our previous discussions. John Jumper : Yes. I think it's pretty linear, Cai, but that's with some noise on it. Cai Von Rumohr : Got it. And then the last one, maybe you could update us in the commercial health IT area, how that did, what the order looks like, and whether we're starting to see any pickup there. John Jumper : Cai, this is John Jumper. I think we're encouraged about commercial health, but we've had some ups and downs. As you know, the Meaningful Use in the ICD-10 decisions have been pushed out to the right again. So this has not had the impact that we saw previously with those decisions, but still, it's room for caution. So it's still too early to -- I think, to call a turnaround in that business, although we have seen some improvement. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Jason Kupferberg : I just wanted to start with a -- kind of a high-level question. I'm trying to sort through the implications of what's happening kind of on the OCO side with a troop drawdown versus what's happening with kind of broader sequestration. Can you just kind of parse those for us and help us understand if you think that things have kind of bottomed out or not purely from kind of a sequestration standpoint? Or is there still another leg to go there? John Jumper : Let me start out with sort of a budget outlook from a strategic level. I think that -- I think it's encouraging that we have a budget agreement, but I think if you look closely at the lag of outlays, actual government outlays, I think that we are in for continued pressure and declines at least through the government fiscal '15. And so I think that pressure continues, and we're probably less optimistic than others about that situation. With regard to the impact of the OCO, I think we are going to see the continuing troop drawdowns, but it is unclear how the impact this is going to have on businesses like ours in that environment. We -- you know that we are looking forward to continuing reductions, but I think the final impact is difficult to predict. I'm going to let Lou comment a little bit more on that. Lou Von Thaer : Yes, I think John got that just right. The only other piece I would add is within the overall government DoD budgets, if you look at the procurement and RDT&E sections of those budgets, they're under even more pressure because personnel costs, facilities costs, a lot of the non- or less-controllable costs continue to increase for the Department amidst the declines. And as a result, while we look forward to being more optimistic, we see more pressure on these budgets for a couple more years. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. And then going back to your comment earlier, I think you said you derived about $11.9 billion in bids outstanding as of the end of the quarter. What percent of those would you estimate could be decisioned by the end of the government fiscal year, as well as by the end of the Leidos fiscal year? John Jumper : Well, let me start. I'm going to say that one of the characteristics of the situation we're in is that decisions, in general, are being pushed to the right. So I've mentioned this on previous calls that the delays in decisions are the things that are probably one of the most harmful aspects of sequestration, and quite frankly, we don't see much improvement in that. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. So no specific percentage that we should be thinking of as parse? John Jumper : I think it would be disingenuous of us to try and parse any answer to you on that. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, okay. And then just last one, which sort of ties into this prior question, but as you think about the prospect for government flush in September, compared to what we saw or, for that matter, did not see last year, I mean, are you expecting it to be similarly tepid? Or could it be less tepid than it was last year? John Jumper : Well, again, I think we're under a new set of rules as we try to figure out the real impact of sequestration, the delayed decisions, the delay in RFP, et cetera, all of the push to the right. It's difficult to say. I can only say that there's no reason to believe it won't look like last year. We don't see anything, quite frankly, that much different in the current environment. So while I think it's impossible to predict, I'd say that the logic would tell us it would look very similar to last year here in the sort of sequestration [ph] ecosystem that we're in -- we find ourselves in right now. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Jose Caiado De Sousa : This is actually Joe on for Rob. Mark, you noted that Q1 is typically the low point for cash flow generation, and I just wanted to ask how should we think about the cadence for cash flow in the remaining 3 quarters and how you kind of get to the $350 million level that you're guiding to. Mark Sopp : Okay. Thanks, Joe. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we had an extra payroll and incentives in Q1. So those incentives won't happen again for the rest of the year. So you'll see improvement in the out quarters from that alone relative to Q1. We do have an extra payroll again in Q3, and so there will be a little bit of pressure there. So all other things being equal, I'd expect Q2 and Q4 to be better. We do expect to see DSO reduction over the course of the year. I expect that to be somewhat gradual, but specific initiatives and catalysts for that are well in mind and are of very, very high priority. So it will build over the course of the year, and there will be quite a bit in Q4. So it will come down to the wire, but I can assure you this team is laser-focused on it, and we're confident in our outlook. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Christopher Sands : It's actually Chris Sands on for Joe. I just wanted to follow up on the commercial health-care outlook. I know you said it remains uncertain, but can you say that it was profitable in Q1 and what your expectation for the full year is? John Jumper : Mark? Mark Sopp : Commercial health was profitable in Q1. It actually had a healthy margin. So we were really pleased to see that in both the absolute and relative to recent quarters. General outlook is relatively flat on the top line given the pipeline we see and the uncertainty that John referred to earlier. We expect to be profitable for the year. Margins will move around a little bit with timing of investments and bids and things like that. And so we're expecting to be, for the year, well above last year, which was not a great year. I would not say our margins are going to be optimized this year for that business. We still are making investments, and we don't quite have the volume we'd like to see to really get to what you might expect for a commercial consulting business. So we've got a ways to go there, but at least we're in the black relative to recent quarters and we're pleased to see that progress. And hats off to the team for their progress there. Christopher Sands : And so is that low- to mid-single digits? Is that reasonable for what you're expecting this year? Mark Sopp : It's more in the mid, maybe a little plus. Christopher Sands : Okay. And then when you said flat for the rest of the year, did you mean relative to Q1 on the top line? Mark Sopp : I missed that question. I'm sorry, Chris. Christopher Sands : When you said flat for the remainder of the year, did you mean relative to Q1 on the top line? Mark Sopp : Basically, give or take a little bit, it's sequentially flat, going out, is our current view. Christopher Sands : Okay. And then switching over to the federal health outlook. John, in your prepared remarks, I believe you said that you'd seen some positive indicators there. Can you give us an update on the outlook there and potentially in the near-term opportunities you're going after? John Jumper : Yes. One of the favorable elements of the federal budget is there's been a considerable uptick in contracting activity in the federal health side. As you know, we have coming up this competition for the defense health medical records, the DHMSM contract, which is the digitization -- re-digitization, actually, of the Department of Defense electronic health-care records system. It's a system that we've been actually running for -- we've won the competition, and we've been running it for some 25 years. So I think this is going to be an excellent opportunity that combines the best of commercial and federal -- or commercial efficiencies to the end of the federal space. So we think we're well positioned there, and again, I think the outlook here is very positive. Christopher Sands : What's the timing on the DHMSM contract? John Jumper : Well, they just released the final section of the RFP. So as I will refer back to my conversation previously about delayed decisions, I'm not going to predict when we might actually have a bid on this, but I think it's going to be in the months to come. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Loomis with Stifel. William Loomis : Mark, you mentioned, on NSS, the margins will be sustained, but when I back out the project adjustment, I get 100 basis points lower if I just take that off the operating income. So when you say that, do you expect additional project write-ups or that write-up to get offset by cost reductions kind of keeping that low-8s-type operating margin through the year in NSS? Mark Sopp : We are looking at low-8s going forward, and I think that our performance on projects is reflected in some of those write-ups. I think the team has done a marvelous job at stabilizing and improving our performance on our programs across the board. And so the write-ups do reflect that, but they also reflect the ongoing cost reductions that Lou and his team have engineered into the business. And cost reductions work their way favorably into contract adjustments, and there's an element of recurring nature in that. In addition to that, we do have some higher-margin specific projects that are either under our belt or within our visibility that also should fuel some improvement in the out quarters. So it's a combination of strong program performance on past and ongoing cost reductions and also some mix improvements going forward that are real drivers for our expected modest improvement moving forward. William Loomis : Okay, great. And then on the -- that you said -- mentioned Plainfield cash grant, can you get into that a little more? And how much of that -- is that part of your operating cash flow guidance, what the amount is, and what that comes from? Mark Sopp : So the Plainfield Treasury cash grant is not part of our operating cash flow guidance because it will be a receipt into the investing activities category, and we expect it will offset our CapEx. And that is why I said we expect net inflows from investing activities for the year fueling more capital deployment opportunity. We filed our Treasury grant application early in the fiscal year, and it's going through its normal process. We are having dialogue with the Treasury Department now, which I would categorize as normal. And with that, we expect to receive proceeds in the second half of the year, as I said earlier. And we've said before that that's nominally a $70 million number, which is part of the overall carrying value of the plant, which is at $275 million. William Loomis : Any update on your potential sale of that? John Jumper : Well, we, as you know, we've -- as we said, we filed for the cash grant. We are working on the performance parameters of the plant, and so we plan to get the plant up into fully operational mode and do everything we can to maximize the value to our shareholders. Mark Sopp : I'll just clarify. It's operational today. John Jumper : Yes. Mark Sopp : It's -- we're working on optimizing its performance. And once we have that well under our belt, it's when we can be better positioned to access the market to maximize shareholder value in a monetizing transaction. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Edward Caso with Wells Fargo Securities. Edward Caso : I was curious in your thoughts of a recent commentary from President Obama, maybe a change in strategy here and how that might impact areas that you're targeting going forward? John Jumper : Which comments, Ed? Edward Caso : Primarily the ones at the naval -- West Point. John Jumper : The -- talking about the global strategy? Edward Caso : Yes. John Jumper : Well, I think you're putting me on the spot here because the commentary on that speech is -- in many cases, has been rather critical. But I think that where that speech left us is sort of back in the middle. I mean, the President talked about sort of extremes of possibilities but left us in the middle with regard to -- and the things that actually have been said before with regard to using allies and others to help us out in our global posturing. I don't think there's anything here that we see is going to affect, at the boots on the ground level, the activities that we see in the future. I think when you break that down to what we do in intelligence, what we do in cyber, what we do in other areas of national security, I just don't see how that -- anything he said makes a difference in what we do. I think, if anything, it puts additional pressure on being able to quickly respond and to be agile to a rapidly changing situation in the world. And, of course, as you know, Ed, that's our forte in this company. That's what we do. So we're ready for whatever does take place. Edward Caso : And any thoughts on the turmoil over at the VA? Do you think that has the chance? And obviously, VA is important to the federal health opportunity, whether that may cause some delays in any of these contract awards? John Jumper : Well, we are -- first of all, let me say we're not involved in any of the major work that goes on over there. We do have some minor positions, and we're very proud of that, working with our veterans. But I think that what we're seeing in the VA is unique to the VA. I think it doesn't take away from the requirement to move out. As a matter of fact, it probably amplifies the requirement to move out with the Department of Defense electronic health-care digitization program, as envisioned. And it sort of amplifies that sense of urgency to be able to take advantage of our technology to be able to do these functions that are still surprisingly being done manually in many areas of what we assume to be a technically proficient market, but we're not there yet. So I think it amplifies that requirement, Ed. Edward Caso : It seems that Congress is more than willing to use the OCO budget to do things that maybe aren't quite OCO work. Does this give you an added level of comfort that change will be more gradual? Lou Von Thaer : Yes, this is Lou Von Thaer. And yes, I think we will see some of that. I think some of the places where we believe we'll be able to transition some of our OCO work into programs of record, I think, in transition through this, already some of those assets are being used in other continents today at small levels. And we think this will -- this -- I -- we think it supports our strategy. And the recent announcements that the President made on when we would potentially end the conflicts in Afghanistan, I think, are pretty consistent with our expectations of the plan that we have laid out. John Jumper : And, Ed, this isn't new. I mean, we've seen this before with the OCO budgets not always being entirely focused on OCO activity. Edward Caso : Last question, pricing, sort of maybe a combination of pricing ad recompetes in the forward 12 months of your -- how much exposure do you have on recompetes? Sort of what's the win rate been recently? And what kind of pricing both on takeaway and on recompete activity are you seeing? Lou Von Thaer : So this is Lou. I'll take that one as well. So we're obviously seeing a very challenging pricing environment. At the same time, our recompetes are at about a normal level for us. We usually run about 20% of the business or so that we recompete for each year. Prices are tight right row, which is why we are being very aggressive in the cost-cutting activities that we're continuing to do, and quite frankly, our win rates have been great lately. Our win rate, actually, for the National Security Sector was up in the mid-60s, which is our highest in the last 5 quarters over the last quarters. These things are all kind of cyclical and ebb and flow. We believe we're still very competitive, and we believe we're continuing to rapidly adjust to these pressures. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Loomis with Stifel. William Loomis : Just a couple more. First, on the book-to-bill on Health and Engineering 1.0, so you highlighted 2 of the wins that totaled about $27 million, but what was the bulk of the rest of those to get to that 1.0? Mark Sopp : Bill, it's Mark. Okay, this -- there is no one big one that dominates the landscape there other than the ones you mentioned and maybe some other announcements that are -- that we've announced over the course of the quarter. But the health business is very fast churned, and so that isn't surprising to consistently run at 1.0. And we improved sequentially in revenues, and so that went in the right direction. It's really a lot of activity, fast churn all over the place, in both the federal engineering, commercial engineering and commercial health and federal health areas. So I can't point to anything that you would recognize that moves the needle there. William Loomis : Okay. And then on cash use, you said excess cash is over $200 million. You have $1.3 billion in debt. What are your plans? It kind of sounds like you are leaning more towards special dividends or something of that nature, but what are your views on acquisition opportunities as well? John Jumper : Bill, this is John. We -- the strategy remains the same. The priorities remain the same, and so I think the board, as I said earlier, considers these things at every meeting. We have a meeting coming up again. So there's no reason to believe that there's going to be a change in the strategy that you've seen in the past. William Loomis : So you would be comfortable if you've paid out all your cash? And your $200 million in cash, you've got $1.3 billion in debt. You would be comfortable leveraging up, potentially, several hundred million to go for an acquisition or... John Jumper : This is something the board considers every quarter. So I'm not going to be predictive in any way, Bill. William Loomis : Okay. But you don't want to prioritize where the deployment would go at this time? John Jumper : Well, we said that our regular dividend is the highest priority. We said that. We've laid out the other options that are considered duly on a quarterly basis. Operator : I'm showing no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to John Sweeney for closing remarks. John Sweeney : Thank you very much, everybody, for joining us today. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we move through the rest of the year. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect, and, everyone, have a great day.",

I would like to thank the Board of Directors for my recent appointment. As some of you already know, my last position was at Boeing, where I ran the Network and Space Systems Group. So I'm no stranger to the defense and intelligence market. And in addition, I've experienced running businesses that served civil and commercial clients. I'm excited to be here. This is a company with a long tradition of leadership and developing technology based solutions to solve important complex problem. We do well in large complicated spaces that require us to understand regulation and to be able to navigate detailed and intricate procurement processes. A Competitive advantage of this firm is our high degree of customer intimacy, a fact that I find alive and well in the seven weeks I have been here. This morning, we announced our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. Despite the one time non-cash accounting charges recorded in the second quarter associated with the impairment of prior acquisition, goodwill and intangibles Leidos delivered underlying solid financial results most notably driven by our National Security and Federal Health businesses. Revenue declines moderated from down 18% year-over-year in the first quarter to down 10% year-over-year in the second quarter. Non-GAAP EPS excluding the goodwill and intangible charges increased 15% compared to the prior year and was reported at $0.61 per share. Cash flow from operations improved significantly from Q1 to $124 million and our overall cash position at the end of the quarter exceeded $350 million bolstered by the receipt of an $80 million cash grant payment for Plainfield. In the second quarter, we experienced a deterioration in revenue and in the sales pipeline for our Commercial Health and our Commercial Engineering businesses, which caused us to reappraise the competitive market and the long-term forecast for both of these businesses. This resulted in a lower earnings outlook and subsequent formulaic reduction in the accounting valuation of goodwill and intangibles in our health and engineering businesses. When we determined that the accounting value doesn't support the goodwill and intangibles on our balance sheet, we are compelled by accounting rules to take an impairment charge and reduce these account balances. This is what we did in taking the $486 million non-cash impairment charge to our goodwill and the $24 million impairment charge to our intangibles in the quarter. Reduced health and engineering performance and further delays at Plainfield are the primary reasons for lowering our 2015 guidance for earnings and cash. Leidos guidance is now revenue unchanged at $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. Non-GAAP earnings lower the $2.10 to $2.30 per share and cash flow from operations lower to at or above $300 million approximately in line with the reduction in earnings. Leidos National Security Sector, an attractive business with a solid foundation, good earnings and cash flow characteristics performed well in the quarter. NSS revenue declined by $94 million or approximately 9% year-over-year with the majority of the decline due to the continued reductions of the U.S. Overseas Contingent Operations or OCO revenues. Excluding the OCO decline, NSS revenues were down only about 2%. National Security Sector operating income performance continued to improve increased by $6 million year-over-year and delivering a sector operating income margin of 8.4%. NSS net bookings for the quarter were $550 million resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.6. Some notable wins include the $250 million National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration IDIQ contract to improve hydrographic surveying services. A $25 million IDIQ contract to provide systems, engineering, technical and management support services for the U.S. Navy Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Atlantic and other contracts for the U.S. National Security and Intelligence client totaling $445 million. Moving to the Health and Engineering sector. I would like to start by saying that the goodwill and intangible charges do not in anyway affect the enthusiasm we have for being in these two markets. Longer term that is one that is seeing increased government involvement and is starting to require the big data and analytic capabilities that we currently provide to the intelligence and defense customers. This is a market where Leidos has significant opportunities that we are committed to competing and growing in this market. In the quarter, our Federal Health business performed well and we continue to be a partner with the Department of Defense in delivering electronic health records to our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. In Engineering, there are attractive elements in this business as well. Security products for example as successfully expanded to an international presence with a high proportion of recurring revenues and strong profitability. Our energy projects, financial consulting practice is among the industries most admired. As we have highlighted in our prior releases, other businesses like renewable energy projects are weaker and will be a smaller part of our engineering business in the future. Health and Engineering sector revenue decreased $64 million or 14% year-over-year primarily reflecting the completion of two energy design build inspection project in fiscal 2014 and lower sales volume in our commercial health business. Excluding the intangible and goodwill impairment, health and engineering operating income margin was 7.3% and this includes $9 million of operating loss on Plainfield or about 2 percentage points of margin erosion in the quarter. As I mentioned, Plainfield experienced extended shutdown in the quarter. We took advantage of this stoppage to upgrade equipment and improve a number of processes. As a result of the stoppage, Leidos received very little revenue from the power plant in the period and therefore our operating losses were higher than we anticipated. The Health and Engineering sector had a book-to-bill ratio of 0.9. Some notable wins include Center for Disease Control and Prevention, a $44 million single-award task order to provide development, support and maintenance of the National Healthcare Safety Network, a prime contract by Ameren Illinois to implement business and residential energy efficiency program. This single-award time and material contract as a three-year period of performance and a total contract value of $55 million and the U.S. Army Armament Research Development and Engineering Center and IDIQ contract with a total value of $300 million. Looking at our consolidated business development results across both sectors. Net bookings totaled $889 million for the second quarter and produced a book-to-bill ratio of 0.7. We ended the quarter with $8.4 billion in total backlog, $2.9 billion of which was funded. The value of bids outstanding at the end of the second quarter was $12.1 billion. I've been the CEO of Leidos for just over a month now during which time; I'd begun an in-depth review of each of our operations. I want you to know that each review is progressing thoughtfully and with deep rigor. While this review is ongoing, there are few things that I would note. First, the strategy that was laid out by the Board is sound and my job is to fine tune it, so that we improve our execution and therefore our return. Second, we need to ensure that we have the right cost structure so that we can compete in the marketplace. Third, we need to make sure that our portfolio is optimized to perform. And finally, our capital deployment strategy continues to prioritize maintaining the dividend, maintaining the appropriate level of financial leverage, investing organically for the future and providing attractive shareholder return. In summary, notwithstanding our disappointment over the goodwill and intangible impairment charge, the operating performance of our core business showed signs of improvement in the quarter and we believe represents a solid base from which to execute and succeed. I'm completely committed to Leidos productivity and growth and to the people that make it happen everyday. With that, I will turn it over to Mark for more details on the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2015. Mark Sopp : Great, thank you, Roger. I would like to start out by providing a little more color on the non-cash impairment charges relating to goodwill and intangible asset this quarter. I will first talk about the Commercial Health impairments since that was roughly three quarters of the goodwill and intangible impairment charges. As we have indicated on our previous calls, while our Federal Health business continues to perform well, we have experienced more challenges in our commercial Electronic Health Records business or EHR. This has included the effects of several legislative changes and delays for ICD-10 and Meaningful Use 2 requirements which has changed priorities for hospital IT spending. In addition, government cuts in Medicare and Medicaid funding to hospitals has adversely impacted funds available for IT projects like EHR. We previously believed these factors would subside and our Commercial Health business would restore to a high growth market over the long-term. After recent developments, business results were significantly short of our expectations in the second quarter causing us to reexamine both our short-term and our long-term view. Our updated projections now contemplate continued short-term contraction with a more modest growth and margin profile over the longer term. Let me cover some of these recent developments. First, a number of large EHR project opportunities in our forecast did not materialize in Q2. Second, we experienced a significant decline in pipeline over the past couple of months. Part of this is explained by yet more recent delays in ICD-10 and Meaningful Use 2 requirements. There is now greater uncertainty over whether these requirements will stimulate spending levels as previously expected. Also continued overall stress in hospital IT budgets appears to be constraining our pipeline as well. Third, we were unable to secure extensions or adjacent projects for a number of EHR consulting engagements which ended during Q2. We see some customers reprioritizing budgets away from ongoing EHR projects for other needs that they have. And fourth, we are seeing increased competitive pressures in the EHR staff augmentation and consulting space manifesting in greater price sensitivity and the need for improved marketing effectiveness. A combination of these factors caused a substantial reduction in our billable workforce in the quarter with little visibility for restoration in the short-term. Consequently, we felt it appropriate to reassess the fair market value of our health business. This reassessment resulted in a non-cash customer relationship intangible asset impairment of $24 million and a non-cash goodwill impairment of $369 million all coming from acquisitions made in 2011 and 2012. We also took a non-cash goodwill impairment charge in our Engineering business this quarter. This stem from underperforming business performance in Q2 in our Commercial Engineering business and as a result reduced short-term and long-term expectations most significantly from our design-build business within engineering. The impairment also reflects a recent reduction in our scope of services to a key utility client. With respect to design build over the past year, we have seen revenue reductions stemming from the completion of several large design-build projects focused on renewable energy power production. Our strategy was to leverage our role on those renewable projects into engineering design, technology and consulting projects in adjacent energy markets. We are now seeing this transition take longer and with less output compared to our previous estimate. Specifically, we have seen low success in new opportunity pipeline conversion so far this fiscal year even as our overall pipeline has continued to expand. Second, we see higher price competition where larger competitors have a scale advantage, exacerbated by recent consolidation in the industry. Third, we've encountered customer delays and cancellations due to capital expenditure tightening, mergers and priority shifts. With those developments, we reassess the fair value of our Engineering business. This reassessment resulted in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $117 million. In context, the total value of the goodwill and intangible impairment charges represent about half of the value of the intangible value held in the ATS sector. The two business areas driving us impairment, Commercial Health and our Commercial Engineering business comprise about 15% of our total revenues. Our longer term outlook anticipates lower Commercial Health and Engineering growth, continued investments to improve our competitiveness and consequently a more muted profitability compared to our previous view. Now, I'd like to turn the attention to our second quarter fiscal 2015 results, highlights of which were strong margins in our National Security Sector or NSS and also cash flow generation. If you refer to slide eight of the earnings call presentation that is available on our Web site, as always, you'll see the consolidated revenues were $1.3 billion or down about 10% year-over-year. Excluding the intangible and goodwill write-downs, Leidos operating income margin was 7.7% for Q2. This was favorably affected by the 8.4% operating margin in NSS offset by the $9 million operating loss, on Plainfield within the Health and Engineering sector, which eroded overall consolidated operating margin by 60 basis points. Interest expense was $20 million in the quarter, tracking to our expected normalized level for the year and our weighted average shares outstanding was $74 million. But the tax rate, the vast majority of the impairments were non-deductible, thus there was little tax benefit associated with the write-down. The effective tax rate removing the effect of the impairments was 42% in the quarter. This reflects an unfavorable discrete item in Q2, reflecting a reduction in tax benefits on the manufacturers deduction coming from losses on Plainfield. On a full-year basis, our effective tax rate excluding the effect of the goodwill impairments is now expected to be roughly 37%, an increase of approximately 1% compared to the expectation we discussed in our last earnings call. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was a loss driven by the impairment charges $5.93 for Q2 and our non-GAAP EPS excluding the impairment charges was $0.61 per share on the higher tax rate. Cash flow generation was a highlight in the second quarter. Operating cash flows came in at $124 million; in addition investing cash flows were a net positive of $68 million driven by the receipt of the U.S. Treasury grant of $80 million for the Plainfield energy plants. This cash flow generation lifted our cash balance to roughly $360 million at the end of the quarter. Now, moving on to guidance, as Roger said earlier, today we are reaffirming our fiscal 2015 revenue guidance of between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion. We're decreasing our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance for fiscal 2015 to the range of $2.10 to $ 2.30 per share, down from the previous guidance of $2.35 to $2.55. This reduction of $ 0.25 or about 10% is primarily driven by higher projected operating losses for Plainfield than previously anticipated and lower operating income projected from our Commercial Health, Commercial Engineering businesses for the reasons discussed earlier. We're also reducing our operating cash flow guidance attendant for the reduced expected cash earnings from Plainfield Commercial Health and Engineering plus a little slippage in working capital reduction. Our updated fiscal 2015 guidance is now at $300 million or more down from our previous guidance of $350 million or more. In terms of timing from a sequential perspective, we expect revenues in the remaining quarters to be modestly below our results in Q2. This is primarily driven by ongoing reductions for our support of overseas contingency operations in our National Security Sector and decreased expected revenues in the commercial areas within Health and Engineering. Now, I will turn the call back to Roger for his closing remarks. Roger Krone : Thank you, Mark. I want to express my gratitude to our employees for sharing this journey with me as we guide Leidos to be a more profitable and consistent value creator. I had the pleasure of visiting half dozen sites and continue to be impressed with our people and their passion and commitment to our customers. We have a very talented employee base and incredible technical capabilities. Although, given the realities of the government budget and the competitive commercial landscape, our near-term future entails some difficult decisions and lots of hard work. It is my job to make our people and our capabilities to exceed for our employees, our customers, our shareholders and the communities in which we operate. Finally, I would like to express my appreciation to our Chairman, John Jumper for navigating Leidos through the recent split and serving as a strong example of leadership. I look forward to working with him to deliver on the promise of Leidos. And now, I will turn it back to John Sweeney for Q&A. John Sweeney : Operator, we would now like to take questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Edward Caso of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Edward Caso - Wells Fargo : Hi. Thank you. My first question, it revolves around the pace of award activity in the federal government, if you can give us any insights as to what you are seeing and in particular where do you think the government will actually spend their full government 2014 budget? Thanks. Roger Krone : Yes, Ed. Hi, thanks. It's great to talk to you again. Of course, we are all looking at what's going on in the federal government space with congress either back or on their way back, we expect a short session. My prediction will be, we will get a continuing resolution which will probably get us through December and then after election they will come back, they may kick that down the road on another CR into the spring. We are seeing customers spend their current obligations. We have been able to bridge through some of the recent issues by having the customers spend prior on obligated balances but a lot of that is out of the pipeline now and they are spending at about the budget level. We have seen in the past couple of years a little bit of an upswing at the end of the fiscal year. We are seeing probably a little less of that this year. And then in the overall market although there are still awards, we continue to see not so much cancellations but delays; delays because of protest and delays of just getting awards through the PBBs system. Edward Caso - Wells Fargo : Great. My other question is last quarter the comfort level with cash was lowered from $250 million to $200 million sort of the number we would expect that you would distribute cash at that level. Has that changed, or are you sort of in a holding pattern as you evaluate here as \u2013 given your recent arrival, any thoughts on sort of what a base cash level would be? Roger Krone : Yes. Ed thanks. And obviously this quarter we are significantly above that in the $360 million balance or so. I haven't actually spent a lot of time to decide whether $200 million or $250 million is the right number. The good news about this company especially as our markets have moderated a bit, we tend to generate significant cash and so cash flow generation is sort of not on the top of the list. I suspect \u2013 but I know we have confirmed the $200 million, but I suspect for the near term we will carry significantly more than $200 million just because of the way cash has been coming in. Our capital structure which I mentioned a little bit in my prepared remarks continues to be about the same as it was before, our philosophy around capital structure. Edward Caso - Wells Fargo : Great. Thank you and welcome aboard. Roger Krone : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Yes. Thank you very much. So could you give us some color in terms of \u2013 and what you have in terms of recompetes coming up and what you have been seeing in terms of pricing recompetes that you\u2019ve won and perhaps takeaways from other companies? Thank you. Roger Krone : Well, great question, Cai. I would tell you the one that is in the forefront of my thinking and where I spend my time. As you know, we are the prime on the military health system program on the federal health side. The government has taken a lot of programs in DoD and consolidated them into a program called the Defense Health Modernization System and the RFP for that program is now out on the street. And that's the implementation across DoD of an EHR, EMR system. And we are teamed with Accenture and Cerner in our offering, by the way that RFP came out either on time or slightly early. It's run by its own PEO now and we expect at least a procurement part of the process to proceed on schedule with proposals due in October and probably preliminary awards in the spring and then we will see how things go after that. You asked a second question which is how we see pricing in some of the recompetes and you are asking this across both the Leidos business and in my former position, the government is recompeting to try to drive more value out of their budget dollar. And companies can respond in one of two ways. They can get their cost down and hold their margin or they can sacrifice margin. Our plan is to get our cost down and part of the discussion I had in my prepared remarks were we are in the midst of top to bottom cost scrub to try to understand where we need to position the cost structure of this company to be competitive to win the recompetes. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Thank you. And as a result of ISIS, have you seen any signs of potential change in demand in the NSS space? Roger Krone : Let's see. I'm trying to think how I can answer that in a white world type answer. I would tell you not anything that moves the needle at this point. Have we had conversations about certain systems that we have that would provide value in the war on terror? Yes, I think we have seen increased conversations about some of our capabilities. But to tell you that you can see it in the bottom \u2013 the top line or the bottom line numbers at this point, I can't say that. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Okay. And the last question is your coming in and you seem to be fairly cautious on capital deployment. John Jumper came in and really was pretty aggressive in terms of dividends for shareholders. What is your thought, is this just a temporary period that you are taking to kind of assess things and that you would kind of go back to the big focus on special cash dividends and deployment to shareholders and share buybacks or what's your longer term thought on capital deployment? Thank you. Roger Krone : Yes. Well, Cai, you know, we as management along with the Board, we look at our capital structure every quarter. And we just sit with the Board last week and for this quarter, we are comfortable with our cash deployment strategy, which is to reaffirm the dividend, right, to look at leverage on the balance sheet and make sure we have the appropriate mix of debt and equity. The one thing which I'm not sure that I heard John articulate quite as well and you'll hear from me is I want to make sure that we're appropriately investing organically in the business because that's what we're all here to do, which is to run a healthy business and to grow and that also means when it's appropriate to actually look at the M&A pipeline and I'm not telling you we are moving aggressively in that direction, but I will affirm we keep an active pipeline, so we're always looking in the marketplace. And then with true excess cash, our commitment continues to be strong to return that to shareholders. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Thank you very much. Roger Krone : Thanks Cai. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Nadol of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Chris Sands - JPMorgan: Hi, good morning, guys. It's actually Chris on for Joe. Roger, wanting to follow up on your comment on M&A. Mark, you'd mentioned that scale specifically was a competitive issue in Engineering business. So are those commercial businesses areas where we could see continued inorganic investment? Roger Krone : Chris, great question. So we have had some discussion about small to mid-size bolt-on acquisitions in the engineering marketplace, but it's against a landscape of where do we want to compete. In my list of priorities, significant M&A and engineering is not near the top. My management team and engineering would like to see it higher. I'm not there yet. I'm trying to better understand where are competitive advantages in engineering and how we segment the market to find leadership positions. And we have some significant leadership positions in engineering. I'm just not comfortable with that business yet to make a commitment to M&A. Chris Sands - JPMorgan: Okay. And then you'd mentioned that one of the key strategy was optimizing the portfolio, could that potentially mean divestitures? Roger Krone : Yes, it does. And although we didn't announce it, our partners did. We actually sold two small businesses in the period, a waste management business and another disaster recovery business for about cash proceeds of about $20 million. And at that level, we will continue to be buyers and sellers of businesses as we simplify our portfolio and segment our markets and look for those leadership positions. Chris Sands - JPMorgan: But nothing larger, you don't expect? Roger Krone : I have nothing larger in the pipeline that I'm actively considering. As they say never say never but that is not the emphasis that I and the leadership team have at this time. Chris Sands - JPMorgan: Great. And then one for, Mark. Could you say what the loss in the second half embedded in guidance from Commercial Health and Engineering is for Plainfield? Mark Sopp : We have a reduction from our first half pace, but I did not say that there was a loss in the second half for those two businesses, but their performances depressed from the first half. It's clearly an area where we are going to strive to do better. Plainfield, as we, I think, alluded to earlier, was down for a while in Q2. We've taken advantage of that improve its performance, so we're expecting actually in that case an improvement in performance in the second half versus the first. So the takeaway is from those three areas less profit collectively than the first half, but not necessarily in a loss position. Chris Sands - JPMorgan: Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies & Company. Your line is open. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company: Thanks, good morning. Welcome, Roger. Just wanted to see if you have a view at this point on some of the longer-term financial targets that have been presented at the analyst meeting last year. So specifically thinking about the low-single-digit kind of revenue growth target for fiscal 2016 into 2017 and 8% plus operating margins. I understand you're taking kind of a reduced longer-term view on the Commercial Health and Engineering business. So does that affect how investors should be thinking about the post fiscal 2015 growth potential organically of the company? Roger Krone : Jason, I appreciate the comment. As you know, we only have guidance out there past 2015, so I want to be careful not to extend the current guidance. But as a point of strategy and philosophy, I don't see any reason why this company can't grow in the middle single-digits and having now gone through every operating unit and almost every contract and look at the new bids, 8% op income is certainly achievable by this company. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company: Okay. It's very helpful. And just to pick up on one of the earlier comments, I think you'd said in the NSS business x [OCOs] (ph) you were down 2% this quarter. How did that compare to what that same metrics would have been last quarter and you think that figure can turn positive, exiting this year just based on how the year-over-year comps perhaps, play out? Roger Krone : Okay. So I'm looking at Mark on quarter-to-quarter. Let me talk for a minute then I'll ask Mark to confirm the numbers. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company: Okay. Roger Krone : First of all, after the OCO adjustment down 2%, that's for me, I view that almost as flat, right, that's within our estimating year. And although you saw our summits number, we're actually going to have a significant increase in summits in the current quarter, in the third quarter although many of those won't come home until fourth quarter or even next year. But there is quite a bit in the pipeline and if we win at our historic rate, we will see a pickup in third quarter and whether that actually gets us to quarter-over-quarter growth, I'll let Mark comment on that. Mark Sopp : Yes, Jason. I would say that the OCO reductions, we do expect to continue although eventually slow in pace as we described at our Investor Day last year, that really is running on the same track that we had then described with some contracts like JLI having their anniversary in terms of reductions in Q3, Q4 of this year. So the headwind does dissipate to some degree, but that said, we still see contraction in the defense outlays in the addressable markets we serve. So we would expect absent or x OCO is still some contraction in the short-term, which Lou and team are certainly focused on finding adjacent markets, plus the previously restricted markets C2, airborne, maritime, command and control work to offset that and provide a growth opportunity in the longer term and that's where our focus is. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company: Okay. And just last one for me. Curious, Roger, if you have a view on kind of the revenue synergy, part of the story here, obviously that was part of the rationale for the split and there were some numbers provided at the time in terms of targets, which I think have been softened to some extent since then. But just qualitatively, how are you feeling about the revenue synergy opportunities, obviously understanding, you're trying to execute against those in a very difficult end market? Roger Krone : Yes, Jason, thanks, good question. So I went looking for that early. The environment I come from really has one company feel. And hat's I think \u2013 a fertile ground here for me to drive the feeling of one Leidos. And although we've got some really great examples of working across the company like Smart Grid as a service and some of our cyber offerings. We also see the potential to do a lot more. And when I meet with Mike Pasqua and Lou and we talk about how we can help across the businesses, we're just finding almost unlimited opportunities to do some really neat things and create some new products and bring those to market. So the good news is, understand the promise at the split, some good work has been done, but what I'm excited about is, I think there is a lot more that we can do and we're already talking about how we can organize better to capture those cross linkages between our businesses. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company: Okay. Very good. Thanks for the comments. Roger Krone : Thanks, Jason. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Bill Loomis of Stifel. Your line is open. Bill Loomis - Stifel: Hi, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Roger. Welcome aboard. Roger Krone : Thanks. Bill Loomis - Stifel: Just can you refresh us how much OCO is still in the business in terms of percent of revenue in the quarterly reported plus in the fiscal 2015 guidance overall? Roger Krone : We're going to think out loud a little bit as Mark and I are jotting some numbers down. Mark Sopp : Roger, OCO was $73 million, the $94 million decline in NSS in the quarter. Roger Krone : Okay. Bill Loomis - Stifel Nicolaus : And then just roughly as a \u2013 in total OCO revenues in fiscal 2015, can you give a percent there or dollar amount? Roger Krone : Have we got shot? John Thomas : Yes. What we said historically and I don't think we've had a change in our perspective is that we've had about $750 million in OCO revenues. We told you that last year, we told you that's going to wind down to about $400 million, $450 million this year. And then longer term, we're going to convert some of those contracts of record. So I think what we said and I'm not sure if we're reaffirming, but roughly about $200 million or so maybe a little more in terms of converting to programs of record in the long run. Roger Krone : Yes, and John, let me elaborate on that a little bit. What we've seen the customers do is to push OCO dollars into the base budget. And we have had a fair amount of luck in following those programs into the base budget. What we're all waiting is for the President to come out with his strategy on the fight on terror. And if you were online this morning, you probably heard that he is asking for a $5 billion counterterrorism fund. And we're yet understand whether that will be called OCO or base budget or it will have a new name. But a lot of the products and services that we provide are well aligned with fighting the world on terror. And we look at this as an opportunity to grow our business. Bill Loomis - Stifel: Okay. So just to be clear, you had $750 million in OCO in fiscal 2014, you're still expecting $400 million to $450 million in OCO revenues in fiscal 2015, is that right, John? Is that what you were saying? John Thomas : Correct. Roger Krone : That's correct. Bill Loomis - Stifel Nicolaus : And then book-to-bill 0.6 in NSS, do you think \u2013 I know some of the federal \u2013 other federal peers had a higher figure in the quarter, it's not the same quarter, you 30 days different, but do you still feel confident that based on the $12 billion in bids submitted that you could see a pretty substantial increase in the book-to-bill in your October quarter? Roger Krone : Yes. As you know, our third quarter is always our strongest quarter in the federal space. We can look into the pipeline and if we win at our historic rate, we should have a very strong third quarter. Bill Loomis - Stifel: And final one on guidance. Why is revenue unchanged? So you explained the lowering of margins, excluding the write-down because of the Plainfield delays and the slower, a lot more investment in health, in particular, in engineering, but revenues which did better as a percent in the quarter, but the revenues are unchanged. Why \u2013 is the health and engineering \u2013 I guess, what I'm trying to ask is, if we just look at NSS and maybe the federal portion of the health. What would you be doing with guidance? Is the lowering of the margins since you're keeping revenues unchanged strictly due to the commercial side and if we just looked at the federal business, which makes up obviously the bulk of your revenues that wouldn't have been unchanged given the performance in the quarter? Roger Krone : Yes, let me start out the answer, and then I'll let Mark give you the details. But I think you've got to get that right, which is obviously our Commercial Health and Engineering in Q3 and Q4 is below what we had expected and given that we have confirmed our revenue number, it's pretty easy to see that we feel better about our federal business. And in fact, that's \u2013 if you look at our internal plan that's what you would see. And that really speaks to the value that we bring to that customer. Let me turn it over to Mark, if he wants to add some detail. Mark Sopp : I\u2019ll confirm both of you that that is indeed correct. Federal is modestly outperforming our original expectations and that is offsetting what we're seeing on the commercial side. But the commercial side is all fixed price and very sensitive to economies of scale from a profit perspective, plus Plainfield which has very little revenue and bottom line impacts, when we shut down are the reasons why revenue is the same attributed to federal strength and margins lower attributed to our reductions in commercial volume. Bill Loomis - Stifel: And just one more on NSS margin, 8.4 in the quarter very strong, you talked about that you seem to imply some non-recurring contract write-ups in the quarter. What would be a sustained rate and assess and what was kind of one-time write-ups if you will benefits in the quarter? Mark Sopp : We still believe our sustainable margin for that business is 8% plus it does have some volatility with contract adjustments. However, historically we have had net write-ups in that business. If you look at multiple years and certainly so far this year there are award for true-ups there. And strong performance on fixed price programs which Lou and his team has done really good work out over the past 6 to 12 months. So we generally expect to see that condition in the positive territory over a long period of time. And that's our fundamental premise but notwithstanding 8% is our target in that area with the volatility we have in contract adjustments from time-to-time. Bill Loomis - Stifel: Okay. Okay. Thank you. Roger Krone : Welcome, thanks. Operator : Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions in queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to John Sweeney for any further remarks. John Sweeney : Thank you very much everybody. And it was a pleasure having you today on our earnings conference call and we look forward to updating you as we move through the rest of fiscal 2015. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Morgan Securities Inc. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Inc. Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Leidos\u2019 Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host Kelly Hernandez Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kelly P. Hernandez:  Thank you Stephanie and good morning everyone. I would like you to welcome you to our third quarter fiscal 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our CEO and Mark Sopp, our CFO and other members of the Leidos management team. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter ending October 31, 2014. Roger Krone will lead off the call with comments on the market environment and our Company\u2019s strategy. Mark will follow with the discussion of our financial performance for the third quarter and our expectations for the future. After these remarks from Roger and Mark, we\u2019ll open the call for your questions. During the call, we\u2019ll make forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding the Company and our expectations about future financial and operating performance. These statements are subject to a number of risks that could cause actual events to differ materially and I refer you to our SEC filings for a discussion of these risks. In addition, statements represent our views as of today, subsequent events and developments could cause our view to change. We may elect to update the forward-looking statements at some point in the future, but we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. Furthermore, during this call we\u2019ll discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in the press release that we issued this morning and is also available and supplemental information on our Investors Relations website. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Roger Krone. Roger A. Krone: Thank you, Kelly and good morning everyone. First, let me start by formally introducing you to Kelly. Kelly joined us earlier this year and now leads our Investor Relations function as Vice President. Kelly has experience in a variety of roles in the investment community, including as a lead portfolio manager. I\u2019m confident you\u2019ll find her experience in these areas valuable and I know she is looking forward to meeting many of you in the near future. John Sweeney is leaving Leidos after serving us well through the separation and the challenging times we have had since then. We wish all the best for John and his continued success. On to the quarter. This morning, we announced our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2015. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with the progress we have made and I view this quarter as a step in the right direction for Leidos. Third quarter revenue of $1.3 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65 reflected strong operations. Most notably during the quarter we generated solid cash flow from operations totaling $179 million. I want to thank our employees for their hard work which helped us achieve that. We saw year-over-year improvements in non-GAAP earnings per share adjusted operating margin and operating cash flow. These highlights demonstrate our commitment to improving internal operations and enhancing efficiency to maximize shareholder value even in the face of continued pressure from an unpredictable Washington. Despite the change in control of the Senate that occurred with the recent elections I don\u2019t anticipate much of an improvement in collaboration on the hill. We expect a continuing resolution for government fiscal year 2015 with funding levels remaining near fiscal year 2014 give or take a little. We do not think there will be any big changes; however, we do expect some relief from sequestration in government fiscal year 2016. The overlap of our third quarter with the end of the government fiscal year led to an increased level of awards in the month of September. A couple of the notable wins in the quarter were national security and intelligence clients awarded Leidos $626 million of contracts if all of the options are exercised. Though this specific nature of these contracts are classified they all encompass machine critical services that help to counter global threats and strengthen the National Security. Also we had a solid win in our engineering business from Magellan Midstream Partners to provide engineering procurement and construction services or condensates order at their Corpus Christi, Texas terminal. This win is a direct result of our technical excellence and full service design build capability. Although the pace of awards did pickup in the month of September the budget flush was not at the level of prior years. Some of this is Washington related, but some of this is Leidos related. Although we had a strong level of summits in the third quarter our 0.9 book-to-bill was not as strong as it could be.  : I am confident that with Michael\u2019s leadership we are in a path to increase our capture rates and enhance our new business performance. As I told you on the last call one of the key competitive advantages of Leidos is our high degree of customer intimacy and one of my main objectives is to streamline our organization to ensure that our customer relationships remained strong. And that our culture and the focus of our employees remain centered on our customers success. So with that backdrop, let me now give you an update on my priorities and strategy for Leidos now that I have a few more months under my belt. As I said on the last call fundamentally the Board\u2019s strategy for Leidos is sound. We remain committed to leveraging our 45 years of expertise gained from working with top government agencies in complex technical areas and strategically taking that expertise into the commercial marketplace. My job is to drive the company to better execute this strategy and we will move hurdles and obstacles to our success. After connecting assessments of our operations and capabilities improving business development was at the top of my list of priorities. And as I said the addition of Michael Leiter to our executive team to drive this effort will help position us well for future increased capture and customer success. My next priority is to streamline our organization and reduce our cost profile. We are on track with the cost reduction commitments we discussed previously and are extending the scale and scope of those reductions into the next fiscal year. These additional cost cutting initiatives are centered on extracting process efficiencies and reducing indirect costs. While we won\u2019t share with you the specific dollar targets for this additional scope we are confident these actions will help us win more business more profitably over time. Please note as I said with business development many of these improvements will not show up in our P&L overnight, but rather they will benefit us as they move through a course of our 12 to 18 months sale pipeline. Thirdly on portfolio shaping. We are world class in our ability to provide our defense, intelligence, and national security clients with groundbreaking technical capabilities. Our strength in tight times with our customers have only increased over our 40-year legacy. Within Health and Engineering sector, we are providing unique capabilities to government and commercial clients. It is our strong commitment to our customers and our deep technical capabilities that enable us to win contract renewals time and time again. So the large majority of what we're doing, we're doing very well and we remain committed to continuing to do those things well. I have however identified a subset of our portfolio that is not a natural fit for the business model we aspire to. It is my objective to methodically extract the maximum value for these components overtime. Some of these are shorter term in nature and we're in active discussions with perspective buyers, others will take considerably longer and require strategic review of all options to ensure we are doing the best we can for our shareholders, employees and customers. I will refrain from presenting a specific timeline on these initiatives as maximizing value for these assets is more important. However, know that this is a top priority for me and my team and it is my intention to focus the company around our core competencies sooner rather than later. We sold two of these small businesses in the quarter. Finally on capital structure and capital deployment, while we were disappointed with the downgrade of our credit rating from Moody's, we did buyback $105 million of our debt below par, getting us a gain in the quarter and more importantly a long-term benefit through the reduced interest expense. Mark will detail more of our capital structure actions in a few moments. Driven by the strong cash flow I highlighted and net of the debt buybacks, we exited the quarter with a very healthy $418 million cash balance. I know capital deployment continues to be a topic of interest for the investor community and therefore I want to remind you that our capital deployment priorities remain as they always have, with paying our dividend at the top of the list. Beyond the dividend, usage for cash are, investing for future growth, managing our financial leverage consistent with being considered investment grade and returning value to our shareholders. As I have said previously we haven\u2019t ruled out M&A, but big M&A is pretty far down our list. In conclusion, I am proud of all that our employees have accomplished during the quarter and I\u2019m excited by what lies ahead.  With that let me hand the call over to Mark Sopp, Leidos\u2019 Chief Financial Officer for more details on the quarter and our outlook. Mark W. Sopp: Thank you, Roger and thanks to all of you for joining us on today\u2019s call. We had a strong quarter on many fronts and I\u2019m pleased to report increased margins, earnings, working capital efficiency and cash flow generation on a year-over-year basis. These improvements are all in the face of continue albeit moderating revenue declines driven by distressed federal government spending environment. Consolidated revenues were $1.3 billion for the third quarter, which represents a decline of 9.8% year-over-year, slightly better than our expectations and driven by better than expected performance from our Health and Engineering sector. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7% also better than expected with $89 million of operating income in the quarter up 25% year-over-year driven by continued solid performance by our National Security sector and better than expected performance from Health and Engineering. Interest expense was $18 million below our typical run rate of $20 million a quarter driven by two items. First as Roger said, during the quarter we repurchased a $105 million of our outstanding debt at below par and second, we also entered into interest rate swap agreements for $450 million of our fixed rate debt maturing in year 2020, effectively converting a portion of our debt to variable rate debt tied to the LIBOR rate? Both of these are expected to drive reduced net interest expense as along as interest rates remain low. Our effective tax rate was below our normative rate due to favorable resolution of reserved items. Non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.65 per share as detailed on Slide 15 and 16 of our investor presentation available on our website. This excludes the impact of $17 million of impairment charges incurred in the Health and Engineering sector which I\u2019ll cover in a moment. Operating cash flow $179 million was a highlight in the quarter. I would like to add to Roger\u2019s remarks my commendations to the team on a job well-done here particularly in a quarter with an extra payroll cycle. We had referenced unfavorable cash flow timing items in prior quarters, in this quarter we saw a recovery from many of those issues with billing and collection efficiencies being the most significant positive driver. We certainly have more work ahead of us to deliver further improvements in this area, but we\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made thus far. We exited Q3 with a healthy cash balance of $418 million and that\u2019s after $105 million of debt buybacks we executed during the quarter. As for deployment of excess cash balances we always review all options with our Board every quarter and paying our regular dividend remains the top priority. Beyond this, share repurchases, M&A and financial leverage management are always options we review and prioritize with the Board each quarter. Shifting to business development results, consolidated net bookings totaled $1.2 billion in the third quarter, for a book-to-bill ratio of 0.9. We ended the quarter with $8.3 billion in total backlog which is down 16% year-over-year. Funded backlog of $2.7 billion was down 10% over the prior year, but still represents over six-months of forward revenue coverage. The value of bids outstanding at the end of the third quarter increased nicely up 34% sequentially to $16.2 billion, this primarily reflects a material increase in the value of bids in our National Security sector. Now let me select sector results for Q3. First, National Security revenues decreased year-over-year by $105 million or 10%, about half of the decline was due to continued reduction in U.S. overseas war related or OCO business. Balance of the revenue decline was driven by overall reductions in Defense and U.S. Government spending. We continue to expect that OCO related revenues will be in the $400 million to $450 million range this fiscal year and that we will eventually be able to turn about half of the remaining business into programs of record in the future. Operating margins in our National Security sector increased 140 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting an operating income increase of $6 million. This reflects ongoing cost reductions across this sector, but also solid program execution. I am pleased to note that these factors more than offset the overall profit impact from the revenue decline. National Security sector net bookings in the quarter were $830 million resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of just over 0.9. Total backlog in this sector was $6.5 billion down 19% compared to the prior year and funded backlog was $1.6 billion down 18% year-over-year. As Roger said we are disappointed by these results and we are making operational and organizational changes to improve the outcome. Looking forward however the value of outstanding submitted bids in the sector at the end of the third quarter increased more than 40% sequentially to $13.9 billion. This included the impact of a few large opportunities recently submitted. Now on to Health and Engineering. Health and Engineering revenues decreased to $33 million or 8% year-over-year. The revenue declines in this sector have moderated quite a bit over the course of this year. The highlight has been strong contribution from our federal health business with a revenue and profitability profile better than our expectations. From a year-over-year perspective the revenue contraction reflects lower sales volume in our commercial health and security products businesses. We were disappointed in particular with a further slip of product deliveries in our security products business, but this remains mostly tied to logistics and administrative delays with one large contract in the Middle East. The timing of the resolution of this delay is uncertain. And we accordingly are being cautious in our expectations on this program in the short-term particularly as it applies to our guidance from the balance of this fiscal year. GAAP operating margins in the Health and Engineering sector include $70 million of impairment charges during the quarter are roughly 450 basis points of margin impact. $40 million of the impairment relates to intangible assets acquired as part of the fiscal 2011 Reveal acquisition. This impairment resulted from the transportation security administrations recent industry announcement detailing lower expected procurements of inspection scanning systems over the next few years. Additionally we incurred a $3 million impairment for intangible assets associated with fuel supply contracts for the Plainfield Renewable Energy plant. When excluding the effect of these impairments profitability improved in Health and Engineering sector compared to the prior year quarter. This improvement was driven mostly by cost reductions, but it\u2019s still depressed by operating losses on the Plainfield power plant which amounted to $6 million in Q3 or about 160 basis points of margin impact. Our health and engineering business had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 in the quarter. Total backlog was 1.8 billion down 3% year-over-year, while funded backlog for the sector was $1.1 billion up 7% compared to the prior year. The value of bids outstanding in health and engineering at the end of the third quarter was roughly comparable to the Q2 level at $2.2 billion. While we did submit the large DoD healthcare management system modernization IDIQ bid this quarter consistent with our past practices we only included the portion related to define task orders in our outstanding submittal number. As such this IDIQ submission did not materially impact our outstanding submittal number for the quarter. Overall, we view these quarters moderating revenue declines and better than expected profitability when excluding the impairments as a step in the right direction for the Health and Engineering sector. That said we still have a long runway of operational improvements we must make ahead of us. In the subsequent positive impacts on the P&L that we expect will be more evident in the medium to longer term timeframe rather than the near-term. Now let me move on to guidance, we expect to deliver fiscal 2015 revenues in the upper half of our guided range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. Our non-GAAP earnings per share we also expect to come in within the upper half of our guided range of $2.10 to $2.30. From an operational perspective we expect our businesses to perform generally inline with seasonal patterns for the top line, which we suggest a slight sequential downtick from Q3 due to holiday impacts on our billable hours. On the margin line we expect our businesses could experience a slightly greater decline than typical seasonality would suggest as some of the margin strength in Q3 such as positive contract adjustments and certain lower indirect expenses are not expected to recur in the fourth quarter. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance also includes the possibility of certain discreet expenses and investments during the fourth quarter to continue to improve our cost competitiveness and also potential continued performance headwinds and certain parts of the business. Much of this is expected to be reflected in the corporate segment, so you can expect an uptick in cost in that area in Q4 relative to Q3. All these items impact us in the near-term from an expense standpoint. In aggregate they drive longer-term savings allowing us to further optimize our cost structure and better positioned us to win business and grow. For fiscal 2015 operating cash flow, we expect to come in comfortably above $300 million, particularly given the strong performance we had this quarter. We expect interest expense would be added a $16 million quarterly run rate now driven by the debt transactions discussed a momentum ago. In conclusion, I\u2019m pleased with the performance in the quarter with the year-over-year improved results in operating margin, earnings per share and most significantly in our ability to generate over two times our net income in cash from operations during the quarter. A job well-done by our employees and certainly a step in the right direction for the company. With that operator, let\u2019s open it up, so we can take some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Edward Caso with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Edward S. Caso:  Hi, good morning. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about what\u2019s going on in the government sector your National Security sector as far as award decision, since you straddled the end of the government year did the award decision continue over that period and are you still seeing it continue and also maybe a little bit on pricing on recompetes and within that win rates. Thanks. Roger A. Krone: Thanks Ed and good morning. Yes although we didn\u2019t see a big rush at the end of the fiscal year, I think we\u2019ve seen steady progress in awards and usually we see quite a bit that stacks up kind of at the end of September, I think this year we\u2019ve just seen them kind of rollout maybe four, six, eight weeks late, but still a fairly consistent and you\u2019ve seen from us in the last week or two some announcements of some wins in the government sector one from NIH and one more in Lou Von Thaer\u2019s business. And then on pricing we've all been doing this a long time, we always say when there is a downturn in the market we see pressure on pricing, but also in the upturn of the market I see pressure on pricing. There is always a value decision by our customer and we need to provide best value for those price tags we acceptable offers when we bid and I would tell you, I don\u2019t think its any different than what we've seen in the past, but as I said in my remarks we continue to focus on affordability and making sure we provide best value to the customer. Edward S. Caso:  My follow-up question is on contract duration, it seemed like for a long time with the budget uncertainty that clients had done a lot of bridges and extensions. Are you seeing them now going with longer-term contracts? Thank you. Roger A. Krone: Well, we\u2019re still seeing some bridges and extensions as programs of records are taking time to get through the PBBs system. I think overall if you asked for a trend, we would say the contracts are probably a little shorter and therefore probably the average duration our backlog is probably tightening up a little bit from where it has been historically and I think that\u2019s really the customers look at the budget uncertainty and when we talk to senior level customers, they don\u2019t want to tie-up a large part of their acquisition budget over the long-term, because they don\u2019t see top line growth and they want more budget flexibility out in the future. Edward S. Caso: Thank you. Roger A. Krone: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you very much. So a quick follow-up, you mentioned some bids that you have got after a quarter. I assume the NIH was after the reported quarter and also the NATO bid, could you indicate any others that you\u2019ve got received since then? Roger A. Krone: I\u2019m thinking. There are actually a list in the press release, I think of four or five that are in the press release. Cai von Rumohr : Those are since the quarter or are those were in the quarter that\u2019s was on.... Roger A. Krone: NATO is since the quarter, NIH is since the quarter and I\u2019m looking at Mark we're just scratching our heads. Mark W. Sopp: That we announced, I think you covered the two big ones since the quarter on tie. Cai von Rumohr : Okay and then on cash deployment your cash flow was better than expected, it looks like it\u2019s good going forward. And yet you seem I guess John Jumper was more for a kind of buyback stock, you are not doing that kind of how should I read that, you are retiring the debt obviously to maintain the investment grade, but in terms of actually spending some of this money when might you do it, because it looks like you got a lot with more to come with portfolio shaping. Roger A. Krone: And Cai appreciate your observation, people have asked me what are some of the positive surprises that you\u2019ve had since come into Leidos. And one of those is the strong cash flow generation that we\u2019ve demonstrated and so it\u2019s a nice problem to have and you know our answer is we sit down with the board every quarter and we talk about cash flow and cash deployment and based upon those discussions we make decisions, what we are going to do with our cash. As you know we still have authorization from the board to buyback stock, you can probably guess we still have room on the debt side and we will be meeting with the board this quarter to have those discussions again. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Your line is open. Jason Kupferberg : Hey guys just wanted to ask a question to start on a book-to-bill I mean we tend to look at it on a trailing 12-month basis just given all the seasonality and lumpiness in the metric and I think it came in on an LTM basis around 0.7 or so for this quarter, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d like to see it a bit closer to one and now with the new head of biz there I\u2019m sure you will move in that direction, but how would you encourage us to think about that metric going forward. I mean is 1.0 a realistic target, let\u2019s say over the next 12 months or so? Or you guys would obviously say there is some limitations in the end market itself. Mark W. Sopp: Jason thanks. By the way it is an area that we are spending a lot of time both in Mike Pasqua\u2019s area and Lou\u2019s and I will tell you that Mike has hit the ground running and I think he is already making an impact. That being said we all know the time constant in this industry is months and in some acquisitions it\u2019s year\u2019s. That with the issues that we see on the hill it is going to take time. So 1.0 are better in the long-term is certainly what we aspire to, but to say that we are going to get there in the next quarter or the quarter after. I\u2019d love to see it and we do have some large bids outstanding if we\u2019re fortunate we win one of the big ones we could have a nice quarter, but the way to think about it from a run rate standpoint is we are still a quarter or two away from really being where we need to be externally focused on the customer and back winning our fair share. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, understood. And just given your discussion earlier around some of the potential divestitures I certainly understand that common thing on timing, but can you give us any rough sort of aggregate size of these potential divestitures in terms of what their current annualized revenue run rate is just so we can roughly get a sense for how big of pie we are looking at here? Roger A. Krone:  I think you\u2019ll understand my answer is no I\u2019m not going to give you a specific size or a piece of the business we are looking at. Although I\u2019ll tell you is that we are not looking at changing the complexion of the company. Right, so we are very comfortable\u2026 Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Roger A. Krone: In the markets where we currently play, we just want to make sure from a natural owners standpoint or does that fit our capital structure doest it fit our expectation on return and so I like to call portfolio tweaking. So these are smaller moves like the ones we completed in the quarter especially if the management attention is disproportionately higher than the return that we get from the business, it doesn\u2019t make sense, I don\u2019t want my team focus on some small businesses, because they are in more difficult markets and so we think it more of it\u2019s a portfolio cleanup and then it is a major repositioning of Leidos. Jason Kupferberg : And just last one from Mark should we expect anymore impairment charges anywhere in Q4? Mark W. Sopp: Granted we\u2019ve got our fair share of them recently. And sometimes external events like we had in the third quarter require us under the accounting rules to re-admire our outlook and sometimes that has the consequence of an impairment. So we do our annual testing in Q4, we\u2019ve disclosed that, so that\u2019s ahead of us. So I\u2019ll point your attention to that, but we are just calling them as we see them each quarter and trying to focus on running the business as best we can. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, thank you guys. Roger A. Krone: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Joseph B. Nadol: Thanks, good morning. Roger, just wanted to come back again to the business development issue that you\u2019ve highlighted, you seem to note that you talked about the cost cuts right after that discussion I think in your prepared remarks and that to me indicated maybe you think the cost competitive is maybe the biggest obstacle to winning, is that the way - is that what you are seeing? Roger A. Krone: Joe, clearly that\u2019s our component and I would love to be able to tell you that we are a single product company and therefore one move would solve our book-to-bill issues. We have a portfolio of businesses and we run from very complicated, very sophisticated front-end R&D all the way to service in O&M business. By the way a cost reduction and reduction in our overhead in G&A benefits us across the board, but its more important and what we call our GST or MSG business where we\u2019re performing service work and those contracts tend to be lowest-price technically acceptable and its much harder to differentiate yourself based upon your technical capability in those marketplaces, those tend to be more cost sensitive. So but cost reduction being more efficient reducing layers getting our processes inline benefits all of our businesses, including those in the HES sector. Joseph B. Nadol: Okay are there - when you look at - if you would breakdown the government segment anyway you want to do whether by capability or customer. Could you maybe given us the higher level sense of where the bookings are better and where really you have struggled a bit more? Roger A. Krone: Let\u2019s see, we don\u2019t guide below the government sector, but let me just pull off of my last comment and say I think people have viewed our company as a technical leader and our I think long-term competitive advantage is stronger where we have deeper technical content and by the way I think we find it less crowded there as well. As we move down into the services world we see a more crowded field and people who don\u2019t have the R&D spend that we do. And I think if you could look at couple of layers in our organizations you would see our win rate commensurate with those comments. Joseph B. Nadol: Okay that\u2019s helpful. And just a couple of little ones, may be for Mark just on numbers and updates. I don\u2019t know if you are willing Mark you just pointed to give us a better sense of sizing the security products business where we are in terms of sales and margins roughly just after some of the items you guys have detailed here this morning. And then any update you can give on Plainfield, you still lost $6 million this quarter, how do you go about getting this off to your balance sheet? Roger A. Krone: With respect to any individual components we're trying to get away from providing a lot of that but that business is not very different in size than its recent history, it has remained our most profitable business and while we have had this disappointing news from TSA we are very optimistic in the outlook of that business and of its team, they\u2019ve been quite agile in expanding their products sales globally despite some of the downticks from Military sales and TSA\u2019s pause. So feel good about that still with respect to Plainfield, as we've consistently articulated we had a pretty significant down time in Q2, we took advantage of that to make some investments, we believe those helped us although we did have a mechanical failure in Q3 we've since recovered from that, we did improve performance albeit its still a loss in Q3 and we're off to a good start performance wise in Q4 and I hope to continue that trend and move towards monetizing that asset as soon as possible. Joseph B. Nadol: Okay. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Bill Loomis with Stifel. Your line is open. William R. Loomis: Hi, thank you. Roger on the awards on NSS specifically the 0.9 book-to-bill, how much of that was the awards that you\u2019re bidding just slipped out of the quarter versus actual losses in the quarter? Roger A. Krone: Great question. Of course it\u2019s always a mix, there are a couple of bids that if they had occurred in the quarter they obviously would have overcome the book-to-bill. Yes, I think it is a mix, part of my concern is there were bids, I thought we would be more competitive on that I thought we should win and some of those happened in the quarter, but there is always sliding to the right in the government space, I mean that\u2019s even in good times with peer review and some of the issues that you\u2019ve got in the Pentagon with - you\u2019re always expect some of that to move to the right, but I\u2019d tell you it\u2019s a balance between the two. William R. Loomis: And within NSS just looking at the intelligent agency business and taking Military out, what would you - what comments can you give about the business climate there in terms of what's going on, any potential reorgs impacting you within the agencies, are you seeing programs moving forward, things of that nature? Roger A. Krone: Yes, I would remark and maybe reflect that the intelligence community is probably the most consistent, most solid, because of what's going on in the world today, there is a need for the products and services and capability that those agencies provide although they are subject to the overall reduction in the budget. Frankly, the committees of Congress that affect them tend to meet in secret. It was actually great bipartisan cooperation in [indiscernible] and they actually get work done which is a terrific thing and then that rolls back to the agencies and the agencies move forward with their procurements. I\u2019ve remarked before is that of all the customers in the DoD government space we like the intelligence community and they have a mission and an urgent need and they continue to move forward their procurements and they\u2019ve been a very solid customer for us. I\u2019m very pleased that we have a large part of our portfolio in that space. William R. Loomis:  And just a couple of quick ones just on Plainfield if you have no mechanical failures in fourth quarter will it be profitable? And then second on security products, Mark how much of the security products is in the guidance is that Middle East order in the guidance or no? Roger A. Krone: Yes, let me talk to Plainfield for a second and Mark can follow-up. So you are asking me to predict what\u2019s going to happen in Plainfield over the next quarter. William R. Loomis: No, no. Roger A. Krone: That\u2019s okay, Bill something I\u2019ve been here for five months and I have found I\u2019m yet unable to do that. We certainly have a scenario where we can get Plainfield to breakeven. We have a planned outage of five or six days to do some upgrades as we get Plainfield operating at its design capacity. I think our goal will be to breakeven. Again I\u2019m trying not to forecast Plainfield. I think that\u2019s at the top of the range. I could see as probably maybe missing that by a few million just given whether and our history in Plainfield is we just - we don\u2019t operate three or four months without some infant mortality issue coming up to bite us which is, why we are being relatively conservative in our discussions with the Plainfield? The good news though and by the way I know you\u2019ve heard a lot of our development and issues relative to the Plainfield I want to highlight the team that\u2019s been working that Jim Moos and [indiscernible] that we have demonstrated our design capability, in fact we\u2019ve exceeded it over an extended period of time, when we have our mechanicals right the plant has been running extremely well. You saw we took an impairment against the supply contracts and that\u2019s because we really wanted to renegotiate the quality of the C&D that we\u2019re burning. I think we\u2019ve gotten our way through that and as an engineer and I\u2019ve gotten a chance to go up to the plant and spend some considerable time there. It is an amazing design effort and it\u2019s a fairly efficient biomass power plant and we get it running on all C&D and keep its reliability where it should be relative to design. It\u2019s a fairly profitable operation going forward. Although as I also said owning and operating a biomass fuel plant for Leidos is just not something in our long-term vision. Mark. Mark W. Sopp: And Bill nothing to on my part to add to Plainfield, but on security products our guidance does accommodate a full slip to the right for that Middle East order and given where we are in the quarter I would say that\u2019s the most likely outcome and that\u2019s why the guidance is set at such. William R. Loomis: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes the Q&A session. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Kelly Hernandez for closing remarks. Kelly P. Hernandez: Thank you Stephanie and thank you everyone for joining us on our earnings call today. We\u2019ll look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect and everyone have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to hand the conference over to Ms. Kelly Hernandez, Vice President, Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Kelly Hernandez : Thank you, Sayed [ph], and good morning everyone. I would like you to welcome you to our fourth quarter and full year fiscal '15 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; and Mark Sopp, our Chief Financial Officer, and other members of the Leidos management team. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter and the full year ending January 30, 2015. Roger Krone will lead off the call with comments on the market environment and our company's strategy. Mark will follow with the discussion of our financial performance for the fourth quarter and our expectations for the future. After these remarks from Roger and Mark, we'll open the call for your questions. During the call, we'll make forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding the company and our expectations about future financial and operating performance. These statements are subject to a number of risks that could cause actual events to differ materially, and I refer you to our SEC filings for a discussion of these risks. In addition, statements represent our views as of today, subsequent events and developments could cause our view to change. We may elect to update the forward-looking statements at some point in the future, but we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. Furthermore, during this call we'll discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in the press release that we issued this morning, and is also available in the supplemental information on our Investors Relations Web site. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone. Roger Krone : Thank you, Kelly, and thank you all for joining us this morning for our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 earnings conference call. I'm pleased to report that we delivered revenue, earnings, and cash flow at or above the high-end of our guided ranges for the fiscal year. We were also able to deliver another strong quarter of operating cash flow, resulting in nearly 400 million of cash being generated from continuing operations during the fiscal year. For the full fiscal year, we were able to improve non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations on a year-on-year basis, despite revenue declines. The efforts of our employees, who are delivering results for our customers enabled us to benefit from solid program execution and improved core operations in multiple business areas. At the same time, we have continued our commitment to optimizing our cost structure. Overall, as I look back upon fiscal 2015, I'm encouraged by the broader indications from our key markets, and in particular, that government budgets seem to be bottoming by the good progress we have made in our portfolio optimization efforts, as I'll update you momentarily, and by the fact that we've hired world-class talent in the various levels of the company, and have already begun to see the positive impacts of their skills and leadership. With increasing uncertainties in the global threat situation, I am confident that Leidos' core capabilities position us very well to make a difference, help protect our nation, and help our customers succeed in their missions. Our strengths in C4ISR, cyber, data analytics, systems engineering, and agile software development are founded on decades of experience built with our National Security clients, yet applicable to all the markets that we serve, including health and engineering. As to the fourth quarter, revenue of $1.2 billion came in roughly as expected, reflecting continued OCO revenue declines. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.69, driven by a strong operational performance in both sectors, including growth in our federal health and engineering businesses, and tax benefits which we realized during the quarter. We generated solid cash flow from continuing operations during the quarter of $102 million, bringing our full year total to $396 million, or roughly double our non-GAAP income from continuing operations. This is one of the great features of our business model, but also reflects a lot of hard work done by one of our Lean Six Sigma teams this year. Our book-to-bill, particularly in the National Security Sector, although up from year ago levels was lower than we would like it to be. Beyond the gradual improvements we anticipate as our initiatives bear fruit, we do expect a material increase in our book-to-bill in the second quarter. I'm extremely proud of our recent successes in expanding our penetration into new markets. As we announced in February, we were selected as the preferred bidder by the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense on a comprehensive effort to transform their material storage and distribution network. The scope of this engagement encompasses information systems, business process optimization, streamlining, enhancing, and optimizing storage and distribution networks, and demand planning and forecasting. This requires that we leverage all of our key capabilities to be successful, and we are pleased that the customer has entrusted us to deliver this solution for them, as we have done in other engagements for the U.S. DoD, and NATO. I am proud of our employees for making this happen, and especially proud that this was truly a collaborative team effort companywide. We are in the middle of contract negotiations with our customer on this, and expect that we will sign the final agreement in the coming weeks, at which point we can recognize this in our backlog and book-to-bill; so stay tuned. Beyond this, a few other notable wins in the quarter were $237 million of contracts awarded by the U.S. National Security and Intelligence clients for mission critical services that help to counter global threats and strengthen national security. And a $77 million single award fixed-price contract by NATO's communications and information agency to provide systems engineering and integration support for the Ballistic Missile Defense Program Office [ph], and a win in our Health and Engineering Sector, notable as a great example of the success we have had in applying our core capabilities born in our National Security Sector, in this case cyber into the health market. Under this prime contract win awarded by Trinity Health for managed security services, Leidos will provide vulnerability scanning, and continuous monitoring and management of critical assets within Trinity Health's infrastructure. This work combines the company's cyber security expertise, and deep domain knowledge of healthcare IT to create a solution that mitigates the risk of potential and undetected security threats in a fully integrated healthcare system. Moving on to portfolio shaping; for those of you keeping track, our portfolio optimization efforts during the fiscal year resulted in the sale of our waste water business, our disaster recovery business, and most recently, of CloudShield. We also entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of our Plainfield Renewable Energy facility, and we expect this transaction to close in the coming months. Mark will provide you with more details on this transaction in his remarks. Overall, these moves help us focus on our core competencies, and on maximizing shareholder value. As we move into 2015, our top three priorities are people; we are committed to hiring the best talent to lead our businesses and drive business development. Innovation; our innovative technology and collaboration across the enterprise will continue to enable us to win new business. Cost; we will continue to streamline our organization and reduce our cost profile through the implementation of Lean Six Sigma, and other tactics. We started the New Year with a healthy cash balance of $423 [ph] million, and the same priorities for cash deployments are as we have articulated before. First, the top priority is maintaining our dividend. Beyond that, uses for cash are investing for future growth, managing our financial leverage in a manner consistent with being investment grade, and returning excess cash and value to our shareholders, all of which we discuss with our Board every quarter. I know the M&A activity in our space has heated up recently, and we have evaluated the major transactions that have occurred. None of these targets were a good fit for Leidos, but we will continue to evaluate a healthy deal pipeline going forward. Lastly, I'd like to take a moment to personally thank John Jumper for his service as Chairman of our Board of Directors, and for his dedication to our company. John was immensely helpful during my transition into the CEO role, and over the past few months. I know that he will continue to add value as a member of our Board. I see the consolidation of the roles of Chairman and CEO as a way to streamline our operations, and also to provide us with some cost savings. I look forward to serving the company in this new capacity as we continue to lead the company towards greater success. And with that, let me hand the call over to Mark Sopp, Leidos' Chief Financial Officer, for more details on the quarter and our outlook. Mark Sopp : Great. Thank you, Roger, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. We had positive developments on many fronts in the fourth quarter as we continue to execute on our plan. This included some financial highlights that I'll hit in a moment, and also furthering our portfolio optimizations in the areas of real estate, as well as through the sale of CloudShield, and more recently, a definitive sales agreement entered into for Plainfield. Consolidated revenues were $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter, which represents a decline of 9% year-over-year, in line with our expectations, the pace of which has moderated over the course of the year. Non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter of $79 million was better than expected, driven by core operations in both sectors, including growth in our federal health and engineering businesses. Our effective tax rate was below our normative rate, which reflects the positive impact of the R&D tax credit, which was enacted into legislation recently, and retroactively applied for the full year. We also benefited from other tax planning initiatives during the quarter, which further reduced our tax rate and should benefit cash flows over the longer term. Non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.69 per share as detailed on Slide 16 and 17 of the Investor Presentation on our Web site, and was better than expected, primarily driven by the stronger core operations I just mentioned and the lower tax rates. Our non-GAAP operating income and diluted earnings per share primarily exclude the impact of a $40 million impairment charge incurred in our Health and Engineering Sector, which I'll cover in a moment. Operating cash flow from continuing operations of 102 million was a highlight in the fourth quarter. This was driven by further reductions in working capital, particularly DSOs, which declined three days during the quarter down to 70 days. We also had unexpected continuation of advanced payments on a couple of contracts, which we continue to believe will burn down in the coming quarters; more on this later. Overall for the year, cash flow from operations as Roger said was $396 million, which reflected a significant reduction in working capital, and was a great achievement by our team. We exited the year with a healthy cash balance of 443 million. This is after spending a 175 million on debt and buybacks during the year, including 73 million which we transacted during the fourth quarter. As for deployment of excess cash balances, paying our regular dividend remains our top priority. Beyond this, share repurchases, M&A, and financial leverage management are always options we review and prioritize with the Board each quarter. Shifting to our business development results, we had a light quarter on consolidated net bookings, which totaled $631 million in the fourth quarter for a book-to-bill ratio of 0.54. For the year, consolidated net bookings were 3.6 billion resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.7. We ended the quarter with $7.8 billion in total backlog, which is down 16% year-over-year, and funded backlog of $2.7 billion, down 11% year-over-year. This funded backlog level still represents over six months of forward revenue coverage. I will point out these book-to-bill and backlog numbers do not include any impact from the U.K. or United Kingdom LCST contract, on which we were selected as preferred bidder as announced in February. As we move forward in our discussions with the Ministry of Defense, we'll be able to better scope the impact of this to our financials. When that contract is signed, we do expect a meaningful increase in our book-to-bill and backlog metrics. The value of bids outstanding at the end of the fourth quarter increased slightly quarter-over-quarter to 16.4 billion. We expect this will decline noticeable once the LCST contract is formally signed, and we can move that bid out of outstanding and into backlog. Turning now to select sector results for Q4; first, in our National Security Sector, revenues decreased year-over-year by $123 million or 13%. Roughly two-thirds of this decline was due to the continued reduction in U.S. overseas war-related or Overseas Contingency Operations funded business, otherwise known as OCO. The balance of the revenue decline was driven by overall reductions in Defense and U.S. Government spending. When adjusting for our OCO decline, our National Security Sector revenues contracted approximately 5% during the quarter, roughly at the same pace it had all year. We've come a long way in absorbing the OCO declines having had more than 1 billion in OCO exposure at its peak. It is important to note that the bulk of this decline is now in the rearview mirror at this point. For the year, we saw OCO revenues at roughly 400 million generally in line with our guided levels. On to profitability, operating margins in our National Security Sector decreased in Q4 to 7.2% from 8.8% in the prior year. The 7.2% margin reflects roughly 50 basis points of margin decline driven by real estate exit costs incurred in the quarter as we right-sized our facilities' infrastructure to lower forward costs. The balance in the decline was driven by a decrease in net favorable changes in contract estimates from the prior year. On to Health and Engineering, revenues for Q4 increased by $9 million or 3% year-over-year. After continued moderating revenue declines throughout the year, we are pleased to have seen growth this quarter. This revenue growth reflects increased sales in the Engineering and Federal Health businesses, where we are beginning to enjoy the ramp up of some of our recent contract wins. Commercial Health contracted as expected, which partially offset this pick-up. GAAP operating margins for the Health and Engineering Sector were negative 4.7%, impacted significantly by Plainfield operating losses, and the impairment during the quarter. As Roger indicated, we have signed a definitive sales agreement on Plainfield and expect to close on this transaction in the middle of the year. As a result of adjusting the book value down to the anticipated sales price, we incurred a $40 million impairment on the book value of this asset. Additionally, Plainfield incurred $6 million of operating losses during the fourth quarter. The combination of these two elements contributed to 13 percentage points of margin erosion without which margins in the Health and Engineering Sector would have been 8.2% during the quarter, or an improvement of a 180 basis points versus the prior year period. This core improvement reflects the revenue growth in our Federal Health and Engineering businesses. Clearly the Plainfield project has had adverse impacts to our financials. The sales agreement turns the plant over to an owner of several power plants. The deal includes approximately $30 million of cash at closing, and a secured note of roughly $80 million. Plainfield will not qualify as a discontinued operation for Leidos. Accordingly, operating results will remain in our reported results from continuing operations until the transaction closes, which again we expect roughly in the middle of the year. While we are disappointed with the further impairment to the value embedded in the sales price, we do believe for many reasons that accepting this offer was the best course of action for the company and our shareholders. Before I get to guidance, I want to mention that in addition to our results, this morning we announced the Board of Directors has approved a change to our fiscal year to more closely align with the calendar year. Rather than ending on the Friday closest to the end of January, our fiscal year will now end on the Friday closest to the end of December. We believe this change will benefit the investment community, this will improve the efficiency of numerous internal processes, and most importantly this will improve our ability to engage with our investors throughout the course of the year. We have posted a supplementary set of financials on our Investor Relations Web site to assist you in this transition, which provides a historical guide for modeling purposes. With that said, the guidance we are providing today is for the full 12-month period of January 3, 2015 to January 1, 2016, which will be referred to as calendar 2015. We plan to report the first calendar quarter ended April 3, 2015 and early May. Embodied within our guidance ranges are assumptions of modest revenue, earnings, and working capital effects from the LCST contract, which we anticipate will impact the second half of the year. Although the contract is yet to be definitized, we were selected as the sole preferred winner, and the U.K. equivalent of what we know in the U.S. as a \"Protest phase\" has expired without incident. As such, we have enough confidence to embed an initial ramp of this project into our guidance for the full year. While it is too early to provide any potential revenue ranges associated with the full scope of this contract, we can say that we intend to partially recognize revenue on a net accounting basis since one element of the scope of this work is to procure materials as an agent for the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense. With that for calendar 2015 we expect revenues in the range of 4.6 to $5.0 billion. While we see an improvement in the budget environment, we expect the discretionary Department of Defense outlays will continue their downward trajectory throughout this calendar year due to the lag effect from prior year budget reductions. The expected impact on that contributes to our overall outlook for the year. We expect OCO revenues to come in at roughly $200 million for calendar 2015. The $200 million year-over-year decline in our OCO revenues from last year accounts for more than two-thirds of the revenue decline reflected in the midpoint of our 2015 guidance range. For non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, we expect a range of $2.20 to $2.45. Operationally, we are factoring in a slight downtick in margins in our National Security Sector due to project churn combined with greater investment in R&D, and in our business development function to increase our pipeline and our capture success. Within Health and Engineering, we expect an improvement in margins driven by increased contributions from security products, and a lower level of operating losses from Plainfield. Embedded within our guidance are expected continuing losses from Plainfield operations during the first half of the year, prior to the expected closing date of the sale. This translates to $0.10 of earnings per share loss embodied in our calendar 2015 guidance of $2.20 to $2.45. We expect interest expense will run at a $16 million per quarter level, lower than the prior year due largely to the debt buybacks transacted over the course of the last 12 months. We also expect a 35% effective tax rate for the year. We expect to generate at or above $200 million in operating cash flow during calendar 2015. The step-down from the year we just reported is primarily attributable to three elements; first, we expect reported DSOs to be relatively flat for the forward 12 months, having benefited from reductions we've seen this past year. However, we expect some advance payments to burn off in calendar 2015, reflecting a working capital headwind. Second, we expect lower cash profits; and third, approximately $30 million in estimated working capital investment associated with the ramp up of the LCST contract. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, we realize the shift in our fiscal year requires many to update their models to reflect the new year-end. To that end, we see no material change in the quarterly seasonality of our business. The cash flows or annual 401(k) contribution which occurs in January will now shift from previously being in Q4 to Q1, and this has a roughly $30 million impact. In conclusion, I'm pleased with the performance in the quarter and encourage that through our portfolio rationalization actions, and the diligent customer-centric efforts of our employees, we are positioning Liedos for profitable growth in the future. With that, operator, let's open it up, so we can take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : Yes, thank you very much. And two questions; maybe you could quantify what you have embedded for the U.K. logistics contract, and secondly, give us an update on where we are with the DHMSM bid? Roger Krone : Hey, good morning, Cai. This is Roger. I'll talk a little bit about U.K., and then I'll challenge Mark to not answer the question, but -- so we're in negotiations with the U.K., and literally, as we speak we're at table over. And until we definitize, and we have -- if you will, we get clearance from the customer, there's really not much that we can say. And there has been a fair amount of press about the size of the contract. It is large. So you have to think when we sign it will be in the billions, not in the hundreds of millions. But we're just not at a point where, for that discrete contract we're willing to talk about what's in there. You're familiar I think with how we all do our planning, which is we take a probability weight of pool of contracts, and we try to estimate with some degree of accuracy what the probability of any one of those occurring, and then we'll put them into a basked, and we add them up; and some perform better and some perform less. So what we tried to do with LCST is to put our guidance together based upon the broad range of outcomes that could come out of negotiation, so that we had enough breadth in the guidance that we could support it whether we sign LCST early, and we get started early, or if it's in prolonged negotiations and takes a while longer, that our guidance would still be solid. So let me look at Mark on LCST, and then I'll come back and bring you up to speed on DHMSM. Mark Sopp : All I'll add to that, Cai, is that we said in our prepared remarks that we do expect a modest impact to revenues and earnings, but not significant, and we do have a plan to achieve our guidance without LCST. I did quantify that we expect an outflow of up to $30 million, or working capital outflows related to the LCST ramp up. And that was important to do because we are explaining a decrease in operating cash flows year-over-year that's pretty significant, and that's a meaningful portion. So we wanted to clarify that. But otherwise, we're sticking to modest for the earnings and revenue impacts at this point. Roger Krone : Okay. On DHMSM, and for everybody else on the call, that's the re-compete of the DHA electronic healthcare records system, Defense Health Management Systems Modernization, I think is what it stands for. So we have submitted. We've been found to be in the acceptable range. So we've been down-selected, and we believe that there are three, but we can't confirm that; three companies that are still involved. We have gone through a series of face to face meetings with the customers, not exactly orals in the traditional ways, but we had submitted questions, they have submitted questions to us. And so this was a chance to expedite the process and get to an understanding of just a whole host of issues. It's a really broad reaching program, and they range from cyber to fielding, and compatibility, and the ability to be interoperable. So we've had I think three or four of those face to face meetings. I think there's one more scheduled, and then there is expected to be a call for something called an IPR, which will be another roll-up of the proposal, and the cost proposal. And so we'll take into account the input we got from the customer to update our proposal. And then there might be a short face to face session after IPR, which we expect will lead to either a final price revision or best and final offer, which could be, given the end of March. And that could be something we submit, maybe mid-May. Again, we're all speculating there. And then it probably would take another 45 to 90 days to evaluate. So that means an award in the latter part of the summer. And then after the award, it's anyone's speculation where it goes from there. It's an important contract to our customer, an important contract to the companies that are bidding. And we are intensely aware of the tendency of companies to protest. So if that happens you'd add another 99 days on the back of the award. And that gets you almost to the end of the year. So from our standpoint, we like where we are, we had great conversations with the customers, but we're not looking for an impact to our financials in calendar year '15, from DHMSM. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you. And a last one, your $200 million of cash flow looks a little bit light, even if we include the $30 million from the U.K. contract. Where is that $30 million? Is that in inventory? What are you assuming for DSOs, and how come that number isn't a little bit stronger? Mark Sopp : Sure. The $30 million for LCST is primarily funds expected to be tied up in receivables, to some degree inventory, but mostly receivables due to a projected ramp up in the second half of the year, and toward the end of the second half particularly. With respect to the other elements of the $200 million cash flow, I will say that we finished the year very strong in DSOs for fiscal '15 at 70 days, better than we expected. We generally expect that to be stable over the course of the year, so no further improvement on that front. So that's a headwind relative to fiscal '15 reported results. A second, as I've said earlier, we had benefited from advanced payments on the order of $40 million plus. Over the course of fiscal '15, we need to be prepared to either work that off or pay that off in calendar '15. And our guidance reflects a full effect of that. And then one thing I didn't mention in particular is because of the dual nature of counting January 2015 as a month twice, both for fiscal '15, and again for calendar '15. We actually have an extra tax payment in the calendar '15 year, which is about a $25 million impact. So when you add all those up, you've got cash earnings of ballpark $275 million for calendar '15, you've got LCST negative 30, you've got cash taxes of 25, and that accounts for some of your deterioration against cash earnings down to the guided level of 200 plus. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you very much. Roger Krone : Thanks, Cai. Operator : And our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Amit Singh : Hi, guys. This is Amit Singh for Jason. Just wanted to quickly start with the guidance; I want to get a feel of how much visibility do you have on the -- let's say, the midpoint of your guidance which is projecting a decline of 6% year-on-year. If I look at against the book-to-bill for calendar '15, it is 0.7, and then the U.K. LCST contract, it seems like it's going to be -- if it gets signed up, it's going to be towards the end of the year. Just wanted to get a sense of how comfortable you are with the guidance. Mark Sopp : I'll start, and ask Roger to finish up, but I will say our confidence is strong coming into the year from a revenue coverage perspective. As it pertains to opening backlog, our coverage is about 70% to 75% of our midpoint, and our range is covered in opening backlog. And while the funded was down year-over-year, it is well north of six months of forward revenue coverage, which is generally a healthy metric. So this is why we of course have confidence in the revenue range we've provided. Roger Krone : Yes, and I'll just add then a little bit of my color. So, this -- I'm sure everybody recalls, I came in, in July, and we addressed an impairment, and we lowered guidance shortly after I arrived. And I think I'm acutely aware that in that year we had touched guidance prior to my arriving. And so, I've benefited now by going through our annual planning process and participating in the building of what we call \"Our annual operating plan.\" So that gives me high confidence in the numbers that we generated, which we used to measure our performance for what we're now calling calendar year '15, which is by the way I think what the rest of the world calls the year that we're in. And so as we created guidance, my goal is to accurately and appropriately reflect where the management team thinks that we will end the year, and then gave it enough bandwidth that we can pretty much keep our guidance where it is for the year with an eye to some foreseeable things that might be on the upside and the downside. So we wanted to have high confidence in our guidance, and to give you numbers that at least where we stand today, we think can stand up for the year, given in the last fiscal year. I think we touched guidance either twice or three times. So I prefer to give you a little broader band, and then allow the guidance to stand for the year, and that's really where we really positioned ourselves. Amit Singh : All right, great. And then quickly on margins; I believe calendar '15 operating margins were around 7.5%. What are you expecting for now that the fiscal '15? Mark Sopp : I think what I would say is we finished on a non-GAAP basis. Fiscal '15, the year we just reported in the low 7% range, and generally, we expect that to be flat in the forward year calendar '15 with two main elements. We expect improved profitability from the Health and Engineering Sector in large part from the absence of Plainfield for the full year as I articulated earlier, and also a bump up in volume and security products that helps HES year-over-year on an apples-to\u2013apples basis. And on the other side, we see volume decline and a slight margin decline in our larger National Security Solutions business due to projection, lower fee rates in some areas, and also some increased investment in business development in IR&D [ph]. So, those two are largely offsets year-over-year; therefore, a flat margin story year-over-year. Roger Krone : I just want to -- if you will, further emphasize that we are continuing our cost reduction program and continuing takeout and leaning of the organization. But for us, given where we've been w book-to-bill, and our first priority is to invest in the business and to reestablish growth, and although we have seen people in the sector take all of their cost savings and drop it to the bottom line is this management team has made a commitment to increase our investment in both internal research and development in bidding proposal. And so, we don't see the margin move that you might expect given what we talked about relative to cost reductions, and that's because as you see in our book-to-bill we've got to fill the pipeline and we've got to lean move forward on winning new business. Amit Singh : Okay. And just quickly one last one from me; Mark, you're planning to retire at the end of this year. So I mean what is the -- how is the transition plan going and the search for the new candidate? Roger Krone : This is Roger. Although Mark is involved in the process, let me answer that question; so, we have met with a first round of external candidates. There are a couple of internal candidates as well. We have sort of done, if you will, very short interviews with about half a dozen people. We are going to circle the wagons as a team and considering the internal candidates as well, probably shorten that list and then starting maybe as early as next week, bringing back a couple of the preferred candidates, and then including our internal candidates. And then make some decisions going forward about where we want to be. So we're not going to put a specific date when we'll have a replacement -- although you can't replace Mark Sopp to have someone to follow Mark Sopp, but we are pleased with the process, and frankly unpleased with the strong interest that we've had by many, many people in coming to Leidos and helping us grow the company. Amit Singh : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Raviv from Citi. Your line is up. Please go ahead. Jon Raviv : Hey, good morning guys. Mark, I was wondering if you could qualify or clarify on the advance payments. Does the guidance assume all of that $40 million benefit burn off in 2015? Mark Sopp : Yes, it does Jon. Jon Raviv : Okay. Roger Krone : And Jon, I'm sure you understand this. So it's a contract, it's under -- it's not been definitized. When we definitize it, we are likely to get the payment back. So think of it as it's a swing. So we are $40 million last year that was high, and then it comes out of this year. So that's an $80 million swing from year-to-year, which I think helps explains why we were over last year although -- we are always thrilled to have money in the bank, but we just assume to get this contract definitized, and move forward with that particular customer. Jon Raviv : Fair enough. And then with that, the guidance implies somewhere in the range of 130% to 150% operating cash flow conversion. Is that the right number to think about going forward? You mentioned tax planning perhaps benefiting over the long term. Is there any kind of upside to that conversion number? And then on a related note, what is the CapEx plan? Mark Sopp : On the tax question, I would say that the benefits that I referred to will be lumpy and largely pertaining to future capital gain transactions. And so I would not point to that as a ongoing, recurring, and stable benefit in our operating cash flows going forward. And I would say our normative rate going forward is nominally 37%-38%. I mentioned 35% for calendar '15, and one of the reasons for that is that we had benefits in the fourth quarter of fiscal '15 just reported and in January as a month in particular. And so the fourth -- I'm sorry, the first quarter of calendar '15 will actually show an effective rate of probably sub-30% from the January 2015 effect and then we'll normalize out to 37%-38% thereafter. So that's something worth mentioning. In terms of overall cash conversion, I would say that once you did make your own view in terms of our cash earnings or our net income, and you add back your depreciation, amortization and stock comp which is 95 to 100 million per year at the current pace, that's a fair model for operating cash flows going forward. And you have to adjust for working capital changes as we guide you. Finally on CapEx, we just finished the year at $30 million, which is well under 1% of revenues, and I don't expect a major change to that statistic going forward. Jon Raviv : Great. And then a quick one for Roger, if I may; can you characterize the competition that you highlighted at NSS and its impact on award sales margins? Is it large companies, small, public, private, commercial companies, government-related companies? And then from your perspective, what has changed over the last year and how do we turn this ship around in terms of the NSS competitiveness? Roger Krone : Okay. Let's see how I can do that question justice. So, by the way, I would say on the competitive side I don't see much new. I mean it is depending upon which line of business; whether you're in SRG or ISG or GSG, at the big end we see the big platform players, we tend to compete with the big five primes for some of the work that we do. In the National Security space or in the Intel space kind of in the middle, it's sort of everybody from bigs to little. And then in the services space, it's some other large companies, but more people in the mid tiers. I would also characterize I don't see a lot of new entrants. You don't see people getting into the National Security business. And relative to competitive, I mean we still see the effects of lowest technically acceptable, and we still see cost as a major differentiator. But I can't sit here and tell you that our biggest problem is always cost, it's making sure that we are close to the customer, we understand your requirements, we have a disciplined process as we go through the acquisition cycle from your requirements, identification to draft RFPs, RFPs proposals, and negotiations. And part of it, and I said this is in prior calls, is we just to get everybody back focused externally and close to the customer. We went through the processes of splitting the company, and that by its nature drives people to think about what's going on inside the company. And I think we have already made significant progress in getting our Presidents and our Ops Managers and our Business Development team to start thinking externally and start thinking about growth and where our customer is going. Unfortunately, and I've said this in prior calls, the time constant in that government National Security business runs 12 to 18 months. So we could fix everything instantly. Last quarter when Mike Leiter arrived, and we wouldn't see the result for 12 to 18 months. So it's going to take some time although LCST is going to probably make our numbers look pretty good for calendar year '15. We know that that is a single event, and we want to get our number of things that we bid and our win rate back where they have been historically for the company. Jon Raviv : Thank you. Roger Krone : Yes. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Edward Caso from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Edward Caso : Thank you. I was wondering if you could grab your crystal ball and [technical difficulty]\u2026 Roger Krone : Ed, we are not hearing you clearly. Edward Caso : [Technical difficulty] resolution with the budget number somewhere in between, the thoughts on I guess the latest proposal is stuffing money into Overseas Contingency Operations for the $290 billion. If you could share your crystal ball with us [technical difficulty]\u2026 Roger Krone : Ed, we heard at the beginning, \"Share our crystal ball,\" and then we heard the last sentence, which was, \"Share our crystal ball [technical difficulty]\u2026 Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, please standby. Again, ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the technical difficulties. Please standby. Again, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience. Please continue to standby. Pardon me ma'am, you are back into your conference call. And we do have a question from Bill Loomis from Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Bill Loomis : Hey, did Ed drop off, or is Ed still on. Operator : Mr. Loomis, your line is open. Please proceed with your question. Bill Loomis : Okay. I think Ed was asking about what the budget outlook for fiscal '16 and the fact the House and Senate wants to put some -- Republicans want to put more of the defense budget into OCO, how that will play out, so I'll ask Ed's question for him before I go onto mine. Roger Krone : Bill, you are so kind; and we apologize for dropping the link. We're actually been talking to you on a cell phone, so -- by the way, my crystal ball is probably about as good as anybody's on the Beltway. And I'll tell you my personal view is I'm more optimistic than most that I find in Washington that with the House and the Senate in the same party, and frankly with Ash Carter being a steady hand in charge of the department, that we will see if you add the base budget and OCO, and couple of the other related defense budgets, we think we will see an increase. But I think the way the game will be played as we view sequestration is they will take a sequestration down there in the base budget, and then they will use the OCO account to frankly do the right thing, which is to spend the money where the money needs to be spent, which by the way we are in areas that we're very excited about C4SR and cyber, supporting troops in the AOR and what have you. And then, we get this budget done, and then we're off into the presidential politics of what will happen the year after and there will probably a lot of rhetoric. But again as I said before, in both years we are hoping that we will actually see an approach bill and authorizations bill and that Congress will want to get something passed or they send something over to the White House. So they can get a home and start to do the early campaign. So we're relatively optimistic about what's going to happen. We will see it in the OCO account. I think they are going to expand the definition of OCO a little bit. All that being said, we are talking about a budget, and Mark made a comment in his statements about outlays, and let's remember that from budget to outlays could be a year and a half, could be longer as it works its ways through the PBBS system. So I think its good news on the horizon. It will take a while for it to filter through, relative to top line growth for us. Thank you. You got a question of your own, I'm sure. Bill Loomis : Yes. So just commercial healthcare; what can you tell us about that business in terms of what the size is now? Obviously it was down in the quarter. Will that trend continue? Is it profitable, and just if you can just be specific on that? Roger Krone : Yes, well, of course we won't guide below the sector level, but I'll just give you some qualitative thoughts. It is down from where it was when I arrived. I'd tell you, I think the business is stable, there's actually some very, very, nice pieces in our commercial health business that point to the strength of our offering, certainly doing implementation of EHR/EMRs and to do Go-Live. So we're pleased with that. What my job really is to find the follow-on leader for that business and to grow, not just our EMR/EHR implementation business, but to roll some of Lou Von Thaer's cyber offerings into our commercial health business, and then to go and grow beyond simple implementation, and do optimization, integration, and interoperability as our commercial providers deal with what now looks to be like a pretty near-term ICD-10 conversion, and then the folks who are still dealing with Meaningful Use-2. The learning for me was, compared to what we have in the National Security side, the commercial health business is a much shorter cycle, and so if we take our eye off the ball, the revenue goes down faster than it does in National Security. But the good news is as we rebuild our relationships with the major providers and reinvigorates their sales force and our consultants, the business can also come back faster. And I think we're being very balanced in how commercial health rolls into overall trends, but I'm still very enthusiastic about the business. I think healthcare is a great place for us to be as a company, and it does leverage our core capabilities. And actually I'd be more optimistic than parts of my team about the year that we'll have in commercial health. Bill Loomis : Is it still declining through the year in all of 2015 and is it profitable, is it earning above or below overall margins, corporate average margins? Roger Krone : Yes. By its nature, it's a profitable business because of the way our sales model works. We put a consultant in and then we've got earnings on top of the consultant. So it's not like a product business where you have the cost of the product and what you could sell it for. We actually go in and we get compensated for the consultant that we put in, and then we add our fee to that, so it's always profitable. But as we build our plan, we expect commercial health in the plan and the guidance to decline in the year. I'm challenging the team to do better than that, but as we built our guidance and our mix, we have commercial health continuing to decline, and as we all remember that is the situation we found ourselves with back in the summer when we impaired the acquisition of Vitalize and maxIT. Bill Loomis : Thank you. Roger Krone : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Kelly Hernandez. Kelly Hernandez : Thank you, Sayed [ph], and thank you everyone for joining us on our earnings call today. Sorry about the technical difficulties. We look forward seeing with you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes our program. You may all disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

Reagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Analysts : Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC William Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Amit Singh - Jefferies LLC Lucy Guo - Cowen & Co. LLC Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Leidos First Quarter 2016 Earnings Results. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kelly P. Hernandez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Hernandez. You may now begin. Kelly P. Hernandez - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; and Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the Leidos management team. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter ending April 1, 2016. Roger Krone will lead off the call with comments on the market environment and our company strategies. Jim will follow with a discussion of our financial performance and our expectations for the future. After these remarks from Roger and Jim, we'll open the call for your questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, during the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in the press release that we issued this morning and is also available in the presentation slides provided on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.leidos.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone. Roger A. Krone - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Kelly, and thank you all for joining us this morning for our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. During the first quarter of 2016, we continued to focus on optimizing the Leidos business platform, the people, the capabilities, and the cost structure, in preparations for the integration of Lockheed Martin's IS&GS business after the transaction is closed. We believe that this focus and the application of our platform to the combined business will enable us to deliver competitively priced, innovative solutions to a broader set of customers and deliver value to our shareholders. From a people perspective, we continue to add key talent throughout the organization, adding diversity of thought, background and expertise, while optimizing the structure to enable us to operate in a lean and agile manner. These efforts in a combination with the reduction of a layer of management, we indicated previously, resulted in several additions to the executive leadership team during the quarter, including Michele Brown as Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, Bettina Welsh as Chief Audit Executive, John Fratamico as Group President of Surveillance & Reconnaissance, and Mary Craft as Group President of Global Services. We've also asked Mike Leiter to lead our Integration Management Office supporting the merger. Tom Dove has been named our Head of Strategy & Business Development and is also a new addition to the executive leadership team. Tom has been with the company for 16 years and has over 30 years of experience in both government and industry. Tom served in the Navy for 25 years in many capacities, including as an Intelligence Officer. Upon his retirement as a Navy Captain in 2000, Tom joined the company and has since held positions in business development, program management and line management. I'm confident that the additional perspectives that all of these leaders bring to the organization will drive positive impacts for our employees and our customers. On capabilities, we continue our investment in internal R&D, enabling us to stay at the forefront of technological innovation in our key addressable markets through our five core capabilities : C4ISR, cybersecurity, systems engineering, large-scale agile software development and data analytics. And, finally, from a cost structure standpoint, as previously mentioned, during the quarter, we announced the divestiture of our design build or heavy construction engineering business through a sales transaction to Haskell. We believe the transaction not only unlocks value for Leidos, but also enables the business to prosper further in the hands of a leading engineering procurement and construction firm. The divestiture allows us to better focus our engineering efforts in the utility, engineering, manufacturing and broader infrastructure markets. We have accordingly renamed the sector as the Health and Infrastructure Sector. With the successful close of this transaction, which occurred on April 15, the significant actions planned for our portfolio optimization program have concluded. We routinely reevaluate our business. So, there could be actions in the future, but there is nothing further of a material level contemplated at this time. Jim will give you more details on the financial impact of the divestitures shortly. We also continue to make good progress on the proposed combination with Lockheed Martin's IS&GS business. We established our Integration Management Office under Mike's leadership. The IMO leadership team comprises leaders from Leidos, IS&GS and Lockheed Martin and is supported by post-merger management specialists from McKinsey. The IMO is focused on all aspects of integration, including systems, finance, people, and maybe, more important, culture. The team is focused on achieving a successful day one operating rhythm that positions the company well to achieve our synergy targets. Since announcing the transaction, I've had the opportunity to visit six of the IS&GS sites, interact with employees there and get hands-on exposure to some of their technologies and capabilities. All of the people I've met and everything I've seen makes me more excited about the merger and the quality of the people that will join the Leidos family and the level of expertise we'll be able to offer to our customers. A couple of other updates on the proposed transaction. On March 28, the Hart Scott Rodino antitrust waiting period expired, satisfying one of the conditions necessary for the successful closing of the transaction. We also filed an initial registration statement with the SEC on April 18 to register the issuance of shares in connection with the IS&GS transaction. We continue to expect closing in the second half of 2016. Onto the quarter. Revenues, earnings per share and cash flow came in generally as we expected, and we're tracking well to the annual guidance we provided on our last call. Consolidated revenue of $1.3 billion were up 5.3% from the prior year, driven by growth in both National Security and Health and Infrastructure Sectors. Our GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations grew significantly in the quarter compared to the prior year, as we improved core operations of the company and due to the impairment charges recognized in the prior period. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share grew 7.5% versus the prior year period. During the quarter, use of cash from operating activities was $18 million, generally in line with our expectations and Q1 seasonality bringing our cash balance at the end of the quarter to $609 million. Our book-to-bill on a consolidated basis is up from a year ago levels, driven by strength in the NSS sector. And we are encouraged by the opportunities we see ahead. My leadership team and I remain committed to continuing the conservative and thoughtful way in which we manage the company focused on growth, profitability and cash generation. With that, let me hand the call over to Jim Reagan, Leidos's Chief Financial Officer, for more details on the quarter and our outlook. James C. Reagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Roger, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We're off to a good start for the year. And, as Roger previewed, we believe that we're on track to deliver to the guidance we provided in our last call. Consolidated revenues for the first quarter were $1.3 billion, up 5% from prior-year levels. GAAP operating income was $89 million during the quarter, up from the prior quarter's $38 million level, reflecting improved margins in our sectors as well as the impact of an impairment charge in the prior year period. GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter was $0.66 versus $0.31 in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA, which is based on our non-GAAP operating income, as detailed on slide 17, was $104 million during the quarter, representing a margin of 7.9%, up from $91 million or 7.3% in the prior year period. The improved adjusted EBITDA margin versus the prior year period is due predominately to strong margins in our National Security sector. Non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.72 per share, up 7.5% from $0.67 in the prior year, as detailed on slides 15 and 17 of the investor presentation on our website. This earnings improvement was predominately driven by operational factors, notably strong program performance in our National Security sector. Note that non-GAAP diluted EPS excludes the gain on a real estate sale conducted during the quarter, as well as the impact of acquisition and integration costs and amortization of acquired intangibles. This is detailed on slide 17 of our earnings presentation. As a reminder, all of the gains and charges associated with our ongoing real estate optimization program will be excluded for the purposes of our non-GAAP results. Operating cash flow used by continuing operations was in line with our expectations and Q1 seasonality at $18 million. We ended the quarter at 61 days sales outstanding, a four-day sequential decline as a result of the design build receivables being moved down to assets held-for-sale. DSOs for the core business, excluding design build, were relatively flat sequentially. We exited the quarter with a sizable cash balance of $609 million. Shifting to our business development results, we benefited from strong awards during the quarter, which resulted in net bookings of $1.2 billion, reflecting a book-to-bill of 0.95 compared to 0.72 in the year ago period. We also made an adjustment to our international backlog during the quarter of $217 million to reflect the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the pound sterling. While the magnitude will vary, we do expect to separately report adjustments to backlog in future years that result from the volatility of currency markets. The value of bids outstanding at the end of the first quarter was $11.9 billion, up 9% sequentially, primarily in the NSS pipeline. Let me turn now to our sector results for the first quarter. First, in our National Security Solutions sector or NSS, revenues increased 4% year-over-year to $898 million, driven by the ramp-up in our UK LCST program. Operating income in NSS in the quarter grew 16% from the year ago period to $72 million or an 8% margin. A higher level of profitability is due to the higher revenue level as well as strong program performance. NSS bookings for the quarter were $950 million for a book-to-bill of 1.1. This represents a sizable improvement over the prior year's 0.7 level and reflects our stable win rates across an increasingly optimized pipeline of bids. Now onto Health and Infrastructure or HIS. HIS revenues for the first quarter were $414 million, an increase of 7.5% from the prior year. This year-over-year growth was driven by a higher level of Federal Health and security product revenues, partially offset by the continued year-over-year contraction in our commercial health business. Q1 operating margin for the sector was 8.7%, reflecting the strong contribution of the security products revenues. Bookings for the quarter in HIS were $291 million, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.7. The softness in book-to-bill is predominantly a result of delays we're experiencing in the awards of some bids and contract modifications in our pipeline. Onto our Corporate Sector, we realized net expenses of $19 million during the quarter. This includes approximately $9 million of transaction and integration costs associated with the IS&GS transaction, which is excluded from our non- GAAP results, as stated earlier. Excluding these transaction related expenses, which we expect to incur for some time, Corporate Sector expenses were within the typical quarterly range. Now, moving onto guidance. For 2016 revenue, our prior guided range was $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion. Embedded within our guidance range, when we first provided this in February, was an assumption of $175 million of revenues from the heavy construction or design build business, which we have since sold. During the first quarter, we recognized approximately $85 million of that $175 million. And given that the transaction closed shortly after the end of the first quarter, the remaining $90 million of revenue we expected from the design build business will no longer be realized in our numbers. However, given the $200 million range in our guidance for revenues, we're comfortable reiterating the range of $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion. For non-GAAP diluted earnings per share this quarter, with the impending transaction with IS&GS ahead of us, we've expanded our definition of non- GAAP diluted earnings per share to exclude the amortization of acquired intangibles. The impact associated with this change in definition is approximately $0.03 for the full year. Note that historical results have also been restated in accordance with this expanded definition and the impact of this is reflected on slides 16 and 17 of our investor presentation. Excluding the amortization of acquired intangibles, we'll become more significant after the consummation of the IS&GS transaction and will enable the non-GAAP results to continue to provide investors with metrics that are more reflective of the ongoing cash earnings power of our continuing operations. We continue to expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.95. Note that there is no impact to our EPS outlook from the design build transaction. We're also reiterating our guidance for cash flow from operations to be at or above $275 million. And, as a reminder, all metrics are guided on a basis to exclude any impact from the proposed transaction with IS&GS. In conclusion, we're pleased with our performance thus far in the year. We continue to optimize all aspects of the Leidos platform, including people, capabilities and costs, in order to enable our employees to focus on addressing the needs of our customers and growing our business. With that, operator, let's now open it up, so that we can take questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning and congratulations. Could you get us updated on the MOD contract and DHMSM as well please? Thank you. Roger A. Krone - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Let me start out and then I'll let Jim follow. I think the MOD contract that is though \u2013 we call the LCST contract in the UK and then I'll come back to the DHMSM contract. So, over in UK, actually things are proceeding well. We're about two-thirds of the way building what we call the new defense fulfillment center, which is the warehouse. We're conducting operations essentially in the old system, improving the operations as they stand. And then when we get the warehouse completed later this year, we'll start to operate out of the new warehouse. We have software development that seems to be on track. And, as Jim mentioned, we've actually seen some favorable financial returns from that program as well. So, we're very, very pleased. In fact, I'm actually going over in a couple weeks. And that business is now under Mary Craft. I think Mary Craft is on an airplane over to meet with that customer. The Defense Health Program, by way, Ed, I think the customer is going to refer to it with a different name going forward, call it, Military Health Genesis Program under the Department of Health Administration. So we'll all have to relearn a new acronym. It's doing well. Our first real major milestone is we have to be up and running in the Northwest at two care facilities, one called Oak Harbor and one at Madigan, by the end of the year. And we're on track to do that. Cerner and Accenture have been doing a great job in supporting the program. And our team has been in place and working together as a team. And the customer remains very, very committed and focused. And it's really been an absolute pleasure frankly to work with the combined government contractor team. They've been a lot of programs and this one is really, really going well. And, of course, the future care of all the active soldiers, sailors, airmens and marines are depending on that program. So, we're really committed to it. Anything on numbers, Jim, you want to touch on? James C. Reagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Just that we've previously said that, particularly focusing on the Defense Health program, it is accretive to the companies and the sectors margins. To date, the programs cost profile is along the lines of what we expected. It's still on plan and we're pleased with both the operating performance and the cash performance of that program. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Can you remind us? Is it just the one task order so far? Have you gotten a second one? Roger A. Krone - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. So that's on the Defense. I think that's on the Defense Health Program. We're still working under task order one. We started in July of last year. It was to run for 12 months. They've actually extended that through the end of the year. So, we're operating on what we call task order one which will get us to, if you will, the first deployment out in the Northwest. So, we're operating under the first task order. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And, finally, under the Genesis or whatever, how fast is the old one rolling off, the old health record contract? Roger A. Krone - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I'm looking to Jim, because \u2013 so it is a rolling wave that clearly takes years to completely roll off. And so we have a deployment schedule that goes in waves. And I really think it takes between eight years and 10 years before the old system is completely turned off. And there are 220-ish healthcare facilities in the contract. And we've broken them into waves by region. And we're starting on Northwest and follow the dictates of the customer and convert hospitals and clinical care facilities on like six month cycles for literally eight years to 10 years. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Congrats and thank you. Roger A. Krone - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Great. Thanks. Thanks, Ed. James C. Reagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Ed. Operator : Our next question is from the line of William Loomis with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question. William Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thank you. With the sale of the design and build work, can you just remind us exactly what do you have in infrastructure? Is there also any legacy liabilities you might have on older builds, contracts? And just help us understand the makeup of that infrastructure business. Thanks. Roger A. Krone - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, let me give you a little bit of the business, and then Jim can talk about the actual terms of the deal and what we've done relative to typical terms like reps and warrantees and ongoing liabilities. So this was the construction business that, when we bought it, I think, went by the name Benham. And although it has changed configuration over the years under SAIC and Leidos' ownership, it is primarily engineering procurement construction business. And it's been in size between 175 (23:26). I think last year we were over 300 (23:27). And it does just what you can imagine. It actually builds large infrastructure projects. And it is associated with the Plainfield power plant and how we got into that and some other projects that have been mostly related to big capital projects, energy, and infrastructure. And when we look at, whether this is a business that was going to grow for us, whether we had the capabilities to be competitive against some of the large EPC companies in the marketplace, we didn't feel that we could. And by selling it to Haskell, they're committed to this sector in this market. And they have a deep management team and they'll be able to extract value from that. James C. Reagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Just on the details of the transaction, Bill. There are \u2013 as you would expect, when you're carving out a business like this, there are a couple of ongoing programs where they were isolated in the contract, and they are indemnities that run both ways for pre-closing and post-closing issues. We've done an assessment of the risk under that. We consider the risk of any issues coming out of that for either party to be minimal. We've got a good handle on both of those programs. In terms of what the sector will look like post-closing, it will be roughly half health, and the other half will be infrastructure comprised of \u2013 roughly a third of the total business will be engineering and then the balance of the sector will be the security products business. William Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. And then just on your NSS business on intelligence agencies, with the reorgs that they're facing \u2013 that your customers are facing, have you seen any disruption in contract award activity or startup of existing or anything like that? Roger A. Krone - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. not really. And you might be referring to \u2013 I think NSA has a program called NSA21. And they are in the process of rolling that out. And I think there are other things going on in the intelligence community. No, in fact, I would maybe reflect that there are a couple of procurements we're in the middle of and they are actually moving at a fast clip. There's a large program again up at the fort that we're bidding on. And the proposal was due on time and they called us and asked us to do orals just one week later. So there, I think a lot of the agencies want to get contracts let before we get into the fall and issues around presidential politics. So no and we've interfaced with the customers at the director level and they're really thinking about how to reorganize, so that they can be effective in the next decade. And we're actually somewhat looking at all this as favorable and the way of \u2013 just as we streamline, I think, they are streamlining and trying to deliver capability faster to their customers. William Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Roger A. Krone - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. James C. Reagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Singh with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. Amit Singh - Jefferies LLC : Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question and great quarter. Quick question on the overall integration, especially related to people, as you mentioned in your presentation as well. As the integration is going on and there might be some voluntary or involuntary attrition on the IS&GS side. And I think Lockheed Martin briefly had a press release that they are laying off around 200 people in that business. So just wanted to get your thoughts on both on voluntary and involuntary side in that business. Whatever is going on, is that as per your expectation? Roger A. Krone - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. So let me first put out the disclosures. So, Amit, great question. As everyone, I'm sure, realizes, we operate the two organizations completely independent. And Lockheed Martin is operating the business in the best interests of the Lockheed Martin shareholders and are taking the actions necessary to be competitive in their markets. And, frankly, we're doing the same. And you're seeing, I think, both organizations become leaner and more agile and removing layers. And I view that as positive. As I understand what IS&GS is doing is, one, there is a contract, I think, going in and that is associated with some of the reductions, but they are becoming more lean and agile. I believe they had a plan that if they had spun-off the business that they would take certain actions. And they're going forward with that, again, to the best of my knowledge. At the executive leadership team, again, the visibility that we have, I think, they have an enthusiastic leadership team. To the best of my knowledge, none of those individuals have moved. We're anxiously anticipating them coming with the business. They're terrific folks. They've got decades of experience in managing their business and have obviously been quite successful in creating value. And so, we don't see, nor do we expect, a lot of either voluntary or involuntary attrition at the leadership team level. You can imagine and that we're going to double in size approximately if you refer to our S-4. And, therefore, our leadership team will grow. Our corporate office will grow. We will need experienced, skilled executives on the team in skills and abilities beyond what we currently have. And so, we're enthusiastically looking at the Lockheed Martin leadership team coming over and being part of the new Leidos executive leadership team. Amit Singh - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. And just a follow-up. When originally Leidos and SAIC separated, one of the reasons was the SETA-related work that had some conflict at more of your R&D type of work. Roger A. Krone - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Right. Amit Singh - Jefferies LLC : I just wanted to get a sense on \u2013 and I know you've spoken about it in previous call too \u2013 IS&GS business. Does it have any SETA-related work that is coming to you? And if it is, will there be any divestiture or anything? What is the plan there? Roger A. Krone - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Let's see. Amit, I'm sure, you could recount the history at Lockheed Martin. And SETA \u2013 yeah, they had a large SETA organization up in Valley Forge called the systems integrator, I guess. It was called Valley Forge and it was spun out as the systems integrator, which, I think, transformed into the company now called Vencore. So, most of the SETA business had been spun out of Lockheed Martin, to the best of our knowledge and we've been pretty thorough and had discussions with the team. There are only one or two contracts that we would describe as SETA, Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance, again, for those people on the call, which would create something called organizational conflict of interest, which would prohibit us from bidding on certain contracts. And we see no impact at all from the single contract that we've identified or even if there is another contract or two contracts of a small nature. Again, they had collected their SETA business and spun it out under the SI. And we're really enthusiastic about how the strategic fit of where Lockheed had positioned IS&GS marries in with the philosophy that we have at Leidos that was promulgated at the time of the split where we spun out the company now, referred to as SAIC, which contained our SETA business. And the more we learn, the more pleased we are about, if you will, architectural work that had been done in creating IS&GS and how well it matches with the work it was done here. Amit Singh - Jefferies LLC : Perfect. Thank you very much and congratulations again. Roger A. Krone - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your question. Lucy Guo - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good morning. It's Lucy Guo on for Cai here. I wanted to see if you could elaborate on the stronger than the average seasonality book-to-bill here. It looks like funded book-to-bill was close to 1.2 times. Can you provide some color on the bid pipeline and your bookings outlook, please? James C. Reagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. Well, yeah, this is Jim. Lucy, thanks for your question. Through the past, I would call, 18 months since Roger arrived and we've been reshaping how we do business development, we've been increasingly careful about taking our B&P and our marketing spend and getting more yield out of it. So we have a set of metrics that we internally follow that's very focused on win rates. It's very focused on qualifying the pipeline earlier and making sure that we don't move forward with large expensive bids that are going to crowd out our ability to invest in growth. So that has a lot to do with making sure that the yield for the money that we put into it gets us more. We're very pleased with the results for bookings that we have for the first quarter. And it certainly is one of the strongest Q1s we've seen in a long time. And I think that when we think about where that fits relative to our peer group, we're feeling pretty good about it. I would say that the other thing is that internally we target a full year book-to-bill at one or north of that. And with that as our target and entering the year with a backlog that's roughly 2x our revenue plan, we're feeling good about the guidance that we've put out there and how we'll be achieving that and the growth plans that we have for the business. Lucy Guo - Cowen & Co. LLC: Can you provide an update on your bids outstanding at HIS or NSS or both? James C. Reagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I think that we mentioned that in the script. Lucy Guo - Cowen & Co. LLC: I may have missed it. I apologize. James C. Reagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, no. That's okay. The total bids outstanding at the end of the quarter was about $2.6 billion. Lucy Guo - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. James C. Reagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And that's the Health and Infrastructure group. Let me go back. It's about $9.3 billion for National Security. Lucy Guo - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. Roger A. Krone - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Lucy, this is Roger. One point that gets me excited is if you've been through the S-4, which is our registration statement, which I know many of the people on the line have gotten. It's certainly available to everyone through EDGAR. There is a pro forma number for the new company and shows $19.4 billion in backlog. And as we get closer to the closing of the transaction, it's just a really powerful number and speaks to the strength of the company and really creates the excitement that we have around where this company is going to go. Lucy Guo - Cowen & Co. LLC: Right. And I was actually going to ask a question on IS&GS. One thing they talked about is their margins had a benefit from some of the larger recompetes (36:05) pushed out and retaining the favorable terms on the incumbent contracts. And that's potentially a headwind going forward in 2017. Are there any factors that you can see that would offset those headwinds in the out-years? James C. Reagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Lucy, this is Jim. I think that the way we think about that is that when we \u2013 we've talked about run rate synergies of the business, so about $120 million. That's gross $240 million. And that comes from combining the two businesses and being able to spread a corporate cost structure over a larger base. That will enable not only the business to be more competitive and to help bolster their pipeline and win rates, but also to help maintain their improved margin profile that you're seeing there. So, that's how we've been thinking about the future of that business and what their margin profile will look like. Lucy Guo - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it. And, lastly, just wanted to get an update on the commercial health IT business that's still down year-over-year, but have you seen any momentum given the new Head of Sales in place and other team members are in place? James C. Reagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Lucy, in my earlier remarks, I mentioned that year-over-year, the commercial health business was down. But what I probably should have added to that was that sequentially the business from Q4 into Q1 has actually had an uptick in revenue. It's had an uptick in bookings and an uptick in profitability. And while we don't talk about those numbers separately, I do think it's worth mentioning on this call that we have seen improved results there. One quarter doesn't make a trend, and it's hard to declare us a definite inflection point. But the business pipeline, which operates on a much shorter sales cycle, the bid pipeline is showing some improvement. And we're looking not only to bolster the core work that we do around system and EHR implementations, but looking at additional value add that we can bring to those same customers as we move up the value chain in that consultative sale. Lucy Guo - Cowen & Co. LLC: That's helpful. Thank you. James C. Reagan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Lucy. Operator : Thank you. There are no additional questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back to Mr. Roger Krone for closing remarks. Roger A. Krone - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Great. Well, thanks. And to everybody on the call, really appreciate your dialing-in. We know it's a busy day in the earnings front. And we appreciate you being able to be on the call. We're trying go early. Whenever a company is involved in a large transaction, I know from your perspective, you always are concerned that management will stay focused on running the core business. And although one quarter doesn't make a year, we believe, at least in the first quarter we've demonstrated that we're going to keep our head down and focused on what we do here. We talk about the Leidos platform and focusing on the people, the capabilities and the cost structure and moving the business forward. And we will continue to do that through the transaction and post the transaction. And just to better describe the way we're dealing with the merger, we have set up essentially an independent Integration Management Office. Those people in the IMO have been, if you will, moved there on a permanent basis. We have backfilled the individuals. So the IMOs, the standalone team and we have filled all of our other positions, talked about Tom Dove coming into the Business Development role. And so Mike has chosen to lead the IMO. He is doing a super job. There is meetings every day on integration. We're talking about systems and people and, as I mentioned, in culture. But that really affords the rest of Leidos to stay very, very focused on what's going on in customers space to make sure we're delivering on our commitment. We're executing to our contracts. And we're going to continue that type of behavior all the way through closing. And then essentially we will collapse the IMO and the IS&GS leadership team into the Leidos' leadership team. And we will operate post-closing as one entity. So stay tuned. And as we achieve milestone events in the merger, we will make announcements and put out 8-Ks. But so far everything seems to be on track. We've heard nothing that would cause us to think we're not going to be able to close near the end of the summer. And we are all enthusiastically looking at the future of this new company that will be on the order of $10.5 billion, $10.7 billion in revenue and, as I said, $19.4 billion in backlog, which is really exciting to all of us. Again, thanks for being on the call. And we'll see you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly P. Hernandez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Hernandez. You may now begin. Kelly Hernandez : Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; and Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the Leidos management team. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter ending July 1, 2016. Roger Krone will lead off the call with comments on the market environment and our company strategies. Jim will follow with a discussion of our financial performance and our expectations for the future. After these remarks from Roger and Jim, we'll open the call for your questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, during the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in the press release that we issued this morning, and is also available in the presentation slides provided on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.leidos.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone. Roger Krone : Thank you, Kelly, and thank you all for joining us this morning for our second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Our second quarter performance was in line with our expectations. Revenue profitability and cash performed on or slightly above our expectations, which includes and expected below average level of contract write-offs in the quarter. Our end markets are gradually improving and despite a slower pace of procurement activity from our customer for new awards, we are seeing increases in scope and the expansion in some of our existing contracts. All this giving us increased confidence in our full year outlook.  Since our last call, we\u2019ve cleared a number of milestones related to pending transaction to combine with Lockheed Martin\u2019s IS and GS business. At this time we have obtained all regulatory approvals both domestically and internationally, and we have also filed our final registration statement with the SEC, which was declared affective on July 11. Our integration management office is making significant progress and preparations for a transaction close date in mid-August. We have secured all required financing for the transaction. Our debt facilities were well received and based on strong demand; we were able to secure better economics as compared to when the deal was initially launched.  These attractive rates now enable the transaction to be accretive in the first four years, as compared to our prior expectation of mutual accretion on a non-GAAP EPS basis. We are encouraged by the recently reported results from IS and GS, as well as all of the feedback we are receiving from our customers our employees, the IS and GS employees and our shareholders regarding the positive impacts expected from this transaction.  In just a few days, on August 1, we will be hosting an investor day at the New York Stock Exchange to share further updates on the transaction, introduce new members of the combined management team, as well as provide financial updates related to the combined entity going forward. The investor event will be webcast live on our website at ir.leidos.com.  From a macro perspective, we are continuing to see a modest recovery in all of our end markets. The downturn is flattened out and outlays are beginning to tick up. We expect that we will start the government fiscal year on October 1, with a continuing resolution. But that\u2019s been evident for some time now. What we don\u2019t know is how long that will be in effect and this won\u2019t be finalized until congress returns in September. However, despite this, we expect a routine start to the new fiscal year with levels of spending consistent with the budget request, so that this time we are not expecting much impact from the CR. This year there is clearly a level of uncertainty surrounding the election and potential impact on budgets; however we are certain that we are well positioned to capture an increasing share of the budget as we remain focused on solving our customers\u2019 most challenging mission-related problems.  On to the quarter, consolidated revenue of 1.3 billion was up 2.5% from the prior year or up 9% when normalized for revenue from our heavy construction divestiture which closed during the quarter. We are encouraged by the growth in the quarter, particularly as it was driven by organic growth in both of our business segments. We did have a couple of notables below the line during the quarter which offset each other. One positive related to lower taxes associated with updated accounting standards, and one negative related to the strengthening of the US dollar against the pound sterling, driven by the British decision to leave the European Union.  Jim will provide details on both of these in a few minutes. Our GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $0.55 from $0.50, largely reflecting the impairment charges recognized in the prior year period. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.68 in the quarter compared to $0.77 in the prior year. The decline is driven by an expected lower level of profitability in our National Security segment compared to the prior year, as I mentioned earlier. During the quarter, we generated 72 million in cash from operating activity, bringing our cash balance at the end of the quarter to $670 million. Our book-to-bill on a consolidated basis was 0.74 for the quarter and 0.84 on a year-to-date basis. Bookings in the quarter were driven by strength in the health and infrastructure sector. We continue to experience stall procurement activity with many of our government customers causing delays in award decision. I am pleased however, with our teams\u2019 ability to engage with customers against this backdrop and offer timely solutions to their mission challenges, which has resulted in scope expansions and program extensions helping offset some of the weakness from the broader delayed decision making.  Heading in to the end of the government fiscal year, we do expect to encounter a strong quarter for bookings and awards activities as is typical for the September ending period. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with the quarter and the progress we are making in returning the company to growth by focusing on our core competencies.  Our priorities remain on our people, our capabilities and our cost, and I firmly believe we are on the right track in all of these areas. Not just in the quarter we reported, but in what lies ahead. Before I turn the call over to Jim, I\u2019d like to take a moment to recognize our employees for the hard work and dedication to the company and to our customers.  With that let met hand the call over to Jim Reagan, Leidos\u2019s Chief Financial Officer for more details on the quarter and our outlook. Jim Reagan : Thank you Roger and thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. Our second quarter results came in as expected, as Roger previewed and we have increased confidence in our full year guidance which we are revising this morning.  Consolidated revenues for the first quarter were 1.3 billion up 2.5% from prior year levels. As Roger indicated, normalizing for the sale of our heavy construction engineering business, revenue showed organic growth of 9% from the prior year period. GAAP operating income was 75 million during the quarter, up 17% from the prior years\u2019 level, reflecting the impact of an impairment charge in the prior year period and partially offset by acquisition and integration cost incurred during the current period.  GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter was $0.55 versus $0.50 in the prior year period. Note that the divestiture of our heavy construction engineering business did not have any material impact on earnings per share in either period. Adjusted EBITDA which is based on our non-GAAP operating income as detailed on slide 17 was 95 million during the quarter, representing a margin of 7.4% down from 107 million or 8.5% in the prior year period. The lower level of adjusted EBITDA margin versus the prior year period was driven by timing of indirect expenses, as well as lower program fees and contract mix in our National Security sector as compared to the prior year period, offsetting improvements in our health and infrastructure sector.  As Roger previewed, we had two below the line items during the quarter, which affectively netted each other out. The first was a $0.04 positive impact driven by a lower GAAP tax rate during the quarter of 32% versus our normal tax rate of 37%. This lower tax rate was due to our early adoption of updated accounting standards related to accounting for share based compensation. This change results in a lower tax rate not just for the quarter, but also retroactively to the first quarter resulting in a $0.05 increase to our prior reported Q1 non-GAAP EPS results. The second below the line impact was a $0.04 negative effect of currency translation adjustment related to an inter-company receivable. This is a non-operating non-cash item which impacted the quarter and was the result of the significant movement in the value of the pound sterling versus the US dollar, driven by the Brexit referendum. As I said, these two effects offset each other during the quarter.  Q2 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.68 per share down from $0.77 in the prior year as detailed on slide 15 and 17 of the investor presentation on our website. Note that non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter excludes and integration cost of 15 million associated with our pending transaction with IS and GS. Non-GAAP diluted EPS also excludes amortization of acquired intangibles and other items as detailed on slide 17 of the investor presentation.  Operating cash flow generated by continuing operations was largely in line with our expectations at 72 million, which reflects payments associated with the acquisition and integration costs previously mentioned.  We ended the quarter at 65 day sales outstanding, flat sequentially as expected when normalized for the sale of the heavy construction engineering business. We exited the quarter with a sizeable cash balance of 670 million and we are well positioned for the expected closing of the IS and GS transaction later this quarter.  Shifting to our business development results, the pace of bookings was impacted during the quarter by the delays in procurement activity at our government customers as Roger indicated. However, in Q2 our business development teams experienced an uptick in RFP activity and we realized a significant sequential increase in debt submissions. Second quarter net bookings were 951 million reflecting a book-to-bill of 0.74. During the quarter, we made two adjustments to our backlog, a 177 million reduction to our international backlog to reflect the strengthening of the US dollar versus the pound sterling, as well as a $125 million reduction to remove the backlog associated with our heavy construction engineering business which was divested.  The value of bids outstanding at the end of the second quarter was 12.8 billion, up 8% sequentially, reflecting both a sequential increase in bid submitted in Q2 as well as the delays in awards in the quarter.  Let me now turn to our sector results for the second quarter. First, in our National Security Solutions sector or NSS revenues increased 4% year-over-year to 915 million, driven by the ramp up in our UK LCST program. Operating income in NSS in the quarter declined from a year ago period to 61 million or 6.7% margin.  The lower level of profitability is due to lower programing fees and contract mix when compared to the prior year period. NSS bookings for the quarter were 520 million for a book-to-bill of 0.6 and 0.8 on the year-to-date basis. We anticipate a higher level of bookings in Q3 due to several anticipated award decisions, as well as typical seasonality at the end of the government fiscal year. Now on to health and infrastructure or HIS. HIS revenues for the second quarter were 373 million a decline of 1.6% from the prior year. However when normalized for the sale of the Heavy Construction Engineering business, revenues in HIS grew 23% organically. This strong revenue growth was broad based, with improvement in the majority of our operations within the health and infrastructure sector, most notably, within our Defense Health Program. Q2 operating margin for the sector was 10.5%, reflecting a strong contribution of our Defense Health Program as well as improvement in our commercial health operations. Bookings for the quarter and HIS were 431 million resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.2 for the quarter and 0.9 on a year-to-date basis.  A strong book-to-bill is predominantly a result of contract orders and modifications including the Hawaii Energy Efficiency Program and the Defense Health Agency\u2019s GENESIS program.  On to our corporate sector, we realized net expenses of 25 million during the quarter. This includes approximately 15 million of transaction and integration cost associated with the proposed transaction which is excluded from our non-GAAP results as stated earlier. Excluding these transaction related expenses which we expect to incur for some time, corporate sector expenses were within the typical quarterly range. Now, moving on to guidance; with half of the year behind us and a successful close of the sale of our Heavy Construction Engineering business, we are now narrowing our 2016 revenue range to 5.1 billion to 5.2 billion from 5.1 billion to 5.3 billion. Note that our initial revenue guidance issued at the beginning of the year included approximately 200 million of revenue for the Heavy Construction Engineering business. Only 100 million of this was realized prior to the closing of the sales transaction.  For non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, we are increasing the range by $0.10 to 285 to 305, reflecting the impact of our first half results from the lower tax rate detailed earlier, as well as our increased confidence in the full year results. We expect our tax rate excluding any impact from our pending IS and GS transaction would be approximately 36% for the second half of the year. Finally, for cash flow from operations, we continue to expect to be at or above 275 million. As a reminder, all guidance metrics are provided on a basis to exclude any impact from the proposed transaction with IS and GS.  In conclusion, we are pleased with the momentum of our business and the strong organic growth in both of segments. We remain resolutely focused on all aspects of Leidos platform including people, the capabilities in cost in order to address the needs of our customers and to grow our business.  Looking ahead, as we move towards a successful close of our transaction with our IS and GS, we look forward to sharing more details regarding our view of the combined entity at our analyst day on August 1. With that operator, let\u2019s now open it up, so that we can take some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Cai von Rumohr : So first if you could walk us through, the revenue guide came down, a 100 million of that was a designed build sale. How much do you expect the impact of Brexit to be? Jim Reagan : Cai, this is Jim. Right now we expect the impact of Brexit on revenue to be immaterial. There is a slight downward impact, but that\u2019s been offset by some other positive impact elsewhere in the business which give us a kind of a new cool view of those two items combined. It is probably also worth saying that there will be no impact on the profitability of the program relative to Brexit because we have done a good job of matching the revenues and costs of that program to both being the UK currency. Cai von Rumohr : And so your margins with NSS was 6-7 I think we\u2019re a little lower than some of us were expecting. May be walk us through some of the mix and lower fee issues and where you expect those to be for the year? Jim Reagan : Sure. I think as we\u2019ve said before, we still think of this business and expect this business over the longer term not just inter quarter but over the longer term there still be an 8%. When we talk about contract mix, I think we\u2019ve said previously that UK contract has a lower than average margin and as that ramped up it has put a bit of a dampening effect on our overall margin.  I think that there is a bigger impact when you think of this year-over-year Cai, and if you go back a year, the second quarter of last year had some pretty significant program write-ups that did not occur in the second quarter of this year. Now that said, we normally see some of those upticks that happened from award fees and EAC adjustments, they typically happened in the third and first quarter of the year and so we\u2019re still thinking about the profitability of the segment being pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve said before. Cai von Rumohr : And the last one, you saw some improvement in the commercial health and an uptick in security. Maybe update us or give us some color on how those businesses are doing and how they look for the second half. Jim Reagan : Sure. In our last call I think we mentioned that we\u2019ve made a few changes in management both at the division management level, that\u2019s working out very well for us and we\u2019ve also back early in the year we\u2019ve brought in a new sales lead. We have experienced a nice uptick in sales activity in commercial health and there\u2019s also been some margin expansion there. So we\u2019re pleased with how things are going there and the new leadership and new product offerings that were incubating in that business we feel very good about. Roger Krone : Hey Cai, this is Roger, let me just add to Jim\u2019s comment is that by exiting businesses that are not in our long term future, plain field, the heavy design build, one of the great things about that is the management team now can refocus on those businesses that are part of our core and your plain field consumed a lot of calories for us and design build as well and now that those are behind us the team has really been able to focus on the environmental business the energy business and the health business and we\u2019ve seen a nice turnaround as a result. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Robert Spingarn : I wanted to ask a couple of questions starting with the organic growth in the Health and Infrastructure segment, what you had there. Jim Reagan : Is that your question Rob, I am sorry; you\u2019re just asking kind of a little more color on that. Robert Spingarn : Yeah a little more color on the organic performance there. I guess you ticked the divestiture out, I just wondered if there is anything else or if it\u2019s just a clean number and what the underlying performance is there Jim. And then I also wanted to ask about the collections that you spoke of in the release a little bit of timing on the working capital. Jim Reagan : Sure. Let me start with the Health and Infrastructure Group, again organic growth there 23%. We said its broad based and that\u2019s a fact. The Defense Health business, the GENESIS program which used to be known as dim sum is actually experienced some contract amendments on past quarter number one. So the volume there is a little bit higher than we might have thought six months ago.  I would also tell you that the performance of the program is in line with expectations from a margin perspective. There\u2019s probably a tangible impact on the commercial health business from now we\u2019re conducting one of the largest if not the largest EHR implementation that there is with the Defense Health Program and that helps give us a little of an additional swagger in the commercial health business, and the margins are expanding there nicely as well. I would say that the engineering part of the business, it\u2019s performing nicely, about on expectations. I think that really what we\u2019re seeing the biggest updraft in that segment is on both commercial and the US government health business. Robert Spingarn : Well just as you\u2019re mentioning it Jim or Roger, when will that swagger begin to convert in to some more opportunities or into some more contracts in either the commercial world or elsewhere in the government. Roger Krone : Well Rob I think that they really are who they are. We\u2019d seen some expansion in the volume of the GENESIS program, we are seeing a nice uptick in the Commercial Health business as I mentioned. And this is also giving us some additional interest in the agencies such as the VA, where we already have our presence and we going to be looking at an expanded presence, and when we have our investor day on August 1, we\u2019re going to talk a lot of more of that how our existing strength in both elements of our health business combined with the qualification that comes over from IS and GS in other elements of the health business particularly at CMS, we\u2019re going to have a lot of conversation about what that means for the combined business. Robert Spingarn : And then I interrupted, you were trying to answer the question on the collections. Jim Reagan : Yeah, so if you back to looking at our collection pattern, I should say our seasonality on cash flow in 2015 and even back to 2014, you will see that there was a much more significant uptick in seasonality in cash flow in Q3 and Q4. You saw it last year, we are expecting to see it again this year, maybe not to the same - if you look at our guidance number, we\u2019re not going to have the same influx of cash in the second half of this year like we saw last year, but we\u2019re still expecting it to have - we\u2019re going have a nice ratio of cash from operations to net income over [1.0X]. Robert Spingarn : Okay. And then just lastly, Roger what are you thinking in terms of book-to-bill for the two businesses for the year? Roger Krone : Slightly above 1. Robert Spingarn : In both cases? Roger Krone : Yeah. We\u2019ve always been a bit seasonal with third quarter being our strongest. And as we kind of look at our pipeline and our book-to-bill that\u2019s what we are expecting this year as well. So obviously we want to continue to grow and so we\u2019re pushing the team for that number to be north of one. Jim Reagan : I\u2019ll just amplify on that with one additional point, we really did see a significant uptick in RPs we were responding to with strong qualifications in Q2 Rob. And our win rates are holding up consistent with what our plan is, and so with additional volume and holding on to the win rates and the different elements of our bid pipeline that underpins the confidence you\u2019ve heard from me and from Roger. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bill Loomis with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Bill Loomis : A couple of things, one on - can you just fill us in UK contract where you stand there with the transition and how do you expect to see margins and profitability over the next year. Roger Krone : Let me talk to you a little bit about what\u2019s going on in the contract and I\u2019ll have Jim touch on the numbers. First, we were just there. We had our leadership team over in the UK last week and we went to Downingtown which is near Telford which is the big fulfillment center. It\u2019s kind of like the equivalent of the DoA here, and we looked at the legacy buildings which is where the current fulfillment of commodity supply is done for the MoD and we visited what we called a new Defense Fulfillment Center think about as about a million square foot warehouse that we are building on behalf of the MoD and there\u2019s a roof and a floor and we\u2019re putting in roads and we will put the first material in that new warehouse in December.  So that is essentially on track given where we started the program really about a year ago. I think we actuate authority to proceed last August. So we\u2019re really pleased with the progress we\u2019ve already seen significant increases in efficiency and throughput by way of some things we care about like loss per day case rates and accidents and things like that are significantly down. We\u2019ve got a great relationship with the UK customer. I\u2019m on a strategy board and I go over four times a year and we sit down with the three star in MoD who is responsible for defense fulfillment.  So, so far everything is on track and we will be moving material from their legacy warehouse complex to their new starting in December and by this time next summer we should have the warehouse fully stocked, we\u2019ll have our new software installed and we\u2019ll be driving efficiencies in to the program. With that I\u2019ll let Jim talk about where we are in the numbers. Jim Reagan : Sure. Relative to the contract performances Roger mentioned Bill the contracts\u2019 performing well, margin generation is as expected for the current phase of the contract which has a fairly significant level of pass-through cost which deny of - because they are direct pass-throughs they don\u2019t have a markup on them. But we still have to book the revenue on it, right.  As the contract moves in to the next phase and we\u2019re actually beginning to increase the volume of what we\u2019re buying on behalf of the customer, that\u2019s when the opportunities to earn some incentive fees relative to what we are saving for the customer, we are able to start to recognize those at higher levels which we are expecting to really kick in more next year than they are this year. And then the last thing that I would say is that, our strategy for the bidding and standup of this contract is make decent margin on this contract and then look to expand our presence in this kind of work, not just in the UK but elsewhere, and so we\u2019re viewing this as being a great place to plant the flag for commodities and logistic services in that part of the world and so far this is a very referenceable customer and we\u2019re performing well and we\u2019re meeting our financial objectives. Roger Krone : I would just add to that very quickly Jim and Bill as in discussions we have with the UK customer, again because I think of the performance that our team has demonstrated, they are contemplating could they add more classes of commodities to our contract and we hope that that will eventually happen. We\u2019ve actually told them we\u2019d like to get the warehouse complete and get our new software installed and get our systems up and running. But we think there is opportunity and relatively near term to add what we would call over in the US, additional classes of spares to the contract which would allow us to expand the topline and therefore the bottom line. Bill Loomis : Okay, great. And just one final one, Jim what was the ending rate and all the cost of financing for the transaction, where did you end up with? Jim Reagan : Right now the new financing is coming at an average just a hair over 3%. So there\u2019s two things that have happened since we previewed the financing back in January. One, as we\u2019ve negotiated the final financing, we negotiated better credit spreads than we had originally modeled and then the second thing is that, we had a conservative view of meaning a higher view of where the LIBOR base rate was going to be, and those upticks haven\u2019t happened.  And the last point that I would make is that we\u2019re now modeling and expecting to lock in a significant part of the new debt at a fixed rate using derivatives that are priced very attractively in the market today. So we\u2019re looking at a strategy that takes a lot of risk up up-drafting floating rates out, but also takes advantage of a very favorable interest rate and swap market today. Bill Loomis : Okay. So for us using including all the fee, amortizations and other costs in there, we should model what like a 3.2 or a 3.3 in our GAAP models. Jim Reagan : Yeah for the incremental debt I would call it maybe about a 3.2, 3.1. And we\u2019ll have more to talk about that on the 1 of August Bill. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question. Edward Caso : It\u2019s from Wells Fargo Securities actually. Can you talk about pricing in the market particularly what the clients are doing regarding cost plus fixed price, time and materials, how that shift is going? Are you seeing any residual hanging on to sort of low price technically acceptable? Any thoughts on that front. Thank you. Roger Krone : Well you know Ed, I think we\u2019ve been saying for a couple of quarters that we have noticed the pendulum starting to swing away from LPTA, and I would comment, I think we still see it swinging, but I would also play-out that there are still some pockets of very, very aggressive lowest bidder cost shootouts that we see in the market place. And we said this before, whether it\u2019s a declared LPTA or an it\u2019s a best value, price is always a factor in procurement.  And one of the reasons that we are so thrilled about the IS and GS merger is what we think it can do for us relative to reducing our [REPO] rates and being able to spread our corporate office cost over a larger direct labor base, because every customer we\u2019ve got, they\u2019ve got budget problems at their end, whether you\u2019re a hospital or you\u2019re in the IC or you\u2019re an investor owned utility, and everybody has some sensitivity to price.  We are seeing agencies that were almost exclusively LPTA having a better mix of LPTA and cost plus and best value, but we think for the long haul, cost, price and affordability is going to be a major factor. So we\u2019re excited about the merger and the consolidation what we think we can do for our, what we call our [RAP] rates. Edward Caso : Can you remind us on the GENESIS contract is there a large pass-through component and when does that related to Cerner and when does that kick in? Roger Krone : Yeah, there is - in the early phases of the contract, Ed there are some licensed purchases. There are some equipment purchases, there is an element of additional work that our large software partner is going to have, and then later in the contract there is also some pass-through of sub-contract work on change management and the actual training and implementation work done in the care facilities.  All of those are a part of the cost model on which fee is borne. So we are expecting a relatively consistent - on this contract in particular a relatively consistent [product] margin through the life of the contract. And so that said, there are some significant pass-through elements, different kinds of pass-through early in the contract compared to later in the contract. But a contract of this size, you\u2019re going to need a lot of partners to do the different elements of the statement of work. Edward Caso : And last question, can you just clarify for us on the net award activity in the quarter, the reported number and the constant currency number on a dollar basis? Roger Krone : Sure Ed. The point of using constant currency is to ensure that we have visibility on the performance of bookings in todays\u2019 dollar versus revenue in today\u2019s dollars. And to the extent that there is a booking in a prior year that the value which has been impacted by changes in exchange rates we isolate that and that\u2019s the 177 million that I alluded to.  So, as we\u2019re looking to show that the activity of today\u2019s awards are growing backlog that\u2019s why we calculate book-to-bill on a constant currency basis excluding the upward or downward shifts in backlog because of currency issues. Jim Reagan : Yeah and Bill I\u2019m sure you realize that we have - our program in the UK is a very long term program and therefore it\u2019s a nice numbering backlog, and any small change in the pound sterling here has sort of a whipsaw affect. And we think it\u2019s important for you all to understand the effect of the movement in the pound sterling, which one might argue overtime is likely to go both up and down and rather than try to explain how we lost a 177 million backlog due to performance, we\u2019re going to make sure that there is strong visibility that that\u2019s a pounds sterling backlog that\u2019s adjusted due to a currency change. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Toby Summer with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. Tobey Sommer : Along those same lines in the UK, I know its early days, but could you comment about Brexit in kind of the longer term opportunities in the UK to extend your business. Roger Krone : Yeah, I think we can talk a little bit. Again when we were over in the UK last week, we met with customers and government officials and think tanks. But I don\u2019t report to be the expert on Brexit, and when I do get a change to do is to talk to a series of people thought they were.  And I think the first answer is, I\u2019m not sure everybody really understands what the long term effect will be. I think some trends that we walked away with is, there are going to be more borders than there were, and we\u2019re in the airport security, border security business, so we like that.  I think the relationship between the US and the UK is going to be one that continues to be strong, and I think that bodes well for us in both ways and our work in the UK is done with mostly UK nationals. So we have a very few ex-pats. We tend to take a couple of dozen people over and get a program started. But because of the type of work we do, very people driven, we hire the majority of our folks locally and do work in country.  Don\u2019t think of us as an exporter, think of us as a solution provider. And so we are encouraged by the climate in the UK that we saw. They\u2019ve got the same issues we have over here. They have defense health, national health issues, air traffic control, logistics, all the things that we have been successful here in the US, we see the market in the UK being equally as robust. And with anything I think the playing field just becomes even more leveled.  There isn\u2019t necessarily a preference for EU and so therefore it is one of the countries that\u2019s in the new latest model that you will set up with the country leadership and country manager, and we expect to be there for the long term and we expect to see organic growth. Tobey Sommer : Just wondering if you can give us a comment on your business in the cyber arena with US cyber command in particularly more publicly active. Thanks. Roger Krone : We don\u2019t often say a whole lot, and I kind of like that posture. I think I like to say it this way is, you can read in the press, the comments that are made by the President and by Mike Rogers and others about what they are doing. But then I think if you understand the model of that agency is, they depend on our contractor base to provide tremendous amount of support and we like to support our customers and we bend over backwards to provide them the capabilities they need to do their job.  And so if you perceive there is a heightened level of activity coming out of those agencies then that should be a positive development for all of the contractors who are supporting us putting them on a day to day basis and its part of our portfolio. I think it\u2019s a role that we\u2019re are very proud of and frankly we are very pleased that customers like that call on like us to provide them people, analytical support through our products and services. Tobey Sommer : Was it additive to grow in the National Security Solution segment? Roger Krone : That\u2019s a precise question, I\u2019m looking to Jim to say, quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year. I think we would say this way, it continues to be a strong part of our portfolio, and we\u2019d expect it to continue to be a strong part of our portfolio over the long haul. And a specific number I\u2019ll let Jim try to answer that one. I\u2019m not sure I have quite that much insight. Jim Reagan : I think Toby it\u2019s safe to say that we do a very significant amount of cyber and cyber related work for our customers and the details around that, I think they probably prefer we not get in to too much of it. I would tell you also that, we consider that business to be very strong, very successful with plenty of historic and future growth ahead of it. And we\u2019re just not in the habit of commenting on individual contracts or individual operation results within the quarter. So obviously we did that. Tobey Sommer : Last question from me, could you comment on the opportunity at the VA and how you think that might develop over kind of a mid to long term. Thanks. Roger Krone : Let me talk a little bit and then Jim can add. We were added to the T4 IDIQ in the period, which is exciting, but I actually think that Lockheed had a T4 as well. So it\u2019s one of those where we think we both are going have a T4. Our Leidos business in the VA has been aspirational. The Lockheed business at the VA is more significant, and as much as I would love to be able to give you a complete [swoop] in its rundown of the Lockheed business at the VA, it\u2019s a little premature for me to do that.  But I know over the long haul Lockheed has been very, very successful in a couple of aspects, run through an organization called QTC through an organization that\u2019s called Solutions Made Simple that they have and some of their base contracts. And we\u2019re just looking forward to getting our defense, military government health teams together and start to think about our strategy and our growth plans going forward. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Amit Singh with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Amit Singh : Just quickly on the taxes, in the first half you got around $0.09 benefit from the tax adjustments. So now based on your new full year tax rate assumption what is the EPS benefit in the second half versus what were you expecting before? Jim Reagan : Yeah, it will be much smaller. So think of it as being a 1 percentage point downtick in our effective tax rate in the second half of the year Amit. Amit Singh : And then on the topline guidance, if you could talk about the guidance is lowered but when you did your first quarter call at the end of April was this divestiture already baked in at that point or this is after that, and also if you could talk about the EPS impact from the divestiture. Roger Krone : What I would you of is it, at the beginning of the year our guidance included an assumption of 200 million of revenue for the designed build business it\u2019s been divested. And as you recall, we had a 5.1 billion to 5.3 billion revenue range at the beginning of the year. When we announced the divestiture, we did not at that time reduce our revenue guidance range because we felt that even after the divestiture we were going to fall squarely in that band.  And now that the divestiture is done and we\u2019re half way through the year, we thought it was appropriate to narrow the range and taking a 100 million out of our model and then having a few upticks on other areas allowed us to come squarely at a new guidance number that we just announced of 5.1 to 5.2. So I think that answers your question on the topline.  On the bottom line the exclusion of that business taking that out has no impact on the prior year or current year EPS assumption because after absorption of indirect cost that business didn\u2019t have a material profit impact for us. The one thing I would remind you of though is that when you take the prior year revenue out of the health and infrastructure business, our second quarter organic growth rate for that business is about 23%. Amit Singh : And just one last one on the LCST and then some contract, is there a way to tell us like how much of that contract is sort of fixed price and what percent of that contract is sort of fixed price cost plus. What is the sort of contract type mix of those contracts? Roger Krone : Both of those contracts are pretty complex and we\u2019re not in a habit of getting in to granular detail about that. But both of those contracts we have elements of fixed price, elements of cost type, elements of award fee and I think that it is safe to say that those mix changes - as I mentioned earlier in the call, the mix changes in scope and contract type on different elements of the task for the UK contract actually gives us a little more profit margin and profit margin upside later in the contract. It should be relatively consistent on a margin basis over the life of the DHA GENESIS contract. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Michael French with Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed with your question. Michael French : Congratulations on the performance and more importantly securing the financing for the deal on favorable terms. Roger unfortunately (inaudible) it does look like we\u2019re going to be dealing with the CR for FY\u201917. There are very few legislative days left before the start of the fiscal year, and there\u2019s lots of work to be done by the (inaudible) congress. The question I have is your comment that you don\u2019t expect much impact to the business, were you talking about Leidos or the combined Leidos and IS and GS. Or in other words, does IS and GS have exposure somewhere to the CR whether it\u2019s in program starts or anything else. Roger Krone : Michael let met draw a very bright line. So after the deal closes I\u2019ll be happy to talk to you about IS and GS, but until the deal closes if you have interest in IS and GS I recommend you call our Bruce Tanner and Marilyn because we just don\u2019t have that kind of an insight in to their business and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for me to comment on Lockheed.  But on our business, what typically happens under a CR, procurement activity slows, we see contract extensions, additional task orders written on IDIQs, and that has two affects which I thought we covered pretty well today is, our existing contracts are extended at their current terms, which are often may be more favorable than what you see in their re-competes. However the book-to-bill becomes a little tepid because instead of getting a two year order you get a two month task order and where we had intended to see a new contract, we just see an extension and our book-to-bill comes down a little bit.  And kind of whether that\u2019s a little bit of what we saw in this quarter and although we still as we said before expect to be above 1.0, an extended CR could slow down awards in the fourth quarter and first quarter of next year depending upon how long it lasts. But overall, the level of spending and the procurement activities that are in our pipeline, we don\u2019t see them overall negatively affected by our CR. Because frankly the world has gotten quite complicated and here we see that in the press every day and as a result many of our customers are spending money as a result of again headline activity. Unfortunately that we all read daily. So there\u2019s work to be done and they\u2019re finding ways to get contracts awarded and current contracts extended and so my comment was, we don\u2019t see a long term affect from the CR this year. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the floor back to Kelly Hernandez for closing remarks. Kelly Hernandez : Thank you all for joining us on our earnings call today. We look forward to sharing more updates with you at our investor day on Monday, August 01. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

Amit Singh - Jefferies LLC Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Leidos Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kelly P. Hernandez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Hernandez. You may now begin. Kelly P. Hernandez - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; and Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the Leidos management team. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter ending September 30, 2016. Roger Krone will lead off the call with comments on the market environment and our company strategy. Jim will follow with a discussion of our financial performance and our expectations for the future. After these remarks from Roger and Jim, we'll open the call for your questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, during the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in the press release that we issued this morning, and is also available in the presentation slides. The press release and presentation, as well as the supplementary financial file are provided on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.leidos.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Kelly, and thank you all for joining us this morning for our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. I want to especially welcome those that stayed up to watch the end of the baseball game last night. In Cleveland, we had the final and decisive 7th game of the Baseball Championship. Congratulations to the Chicago Cubs for their late-night extra-inning win and to the Cleveland Indians for making it one of the most exciting Game 7's ever. Truly a year of the underdog. On to the call. I'm pleased with our results for the quarter. Our focus on executing the business during the acquisition process enabled us to deliver record quarterly earnings, continue organic growth, and strong cash flow. We successfully completed our acquisition of Lockheed Martin's former IS&GS business on August 16. This transformational combination has already begun to deliver on the promises that we saw. The quality of the people, commonality of values, and commitment to our customers has improved our ability to compete for prime positions on new larger programs. At the same time, both legacy Leidos and IS&GS have already begun to submit bids based on the lower cost structure enabled by the acquisition. The experience we have had as a combined entity over the two-and-a-half months since closing increases my confidence that this combination will drive increased value for our customers, our employees, and our shareholders. We enjoyed several large contract wins during the quarter, helping to drive our book-to-bill to 1.6. Most notably, we won a prime contract for $777 million single-award task order to support the Army Geospatial Center's High-Resolution, 3D Geospatial program. Leidos has a long history of directly supporting U.S. Army war fighters through vital airborne programs. Our selection on this contract solidifies our standing as a leader in airborne ISR capabilities. From a macro perspective, we are continuing to see a modest recovery in our end-markets. The downturn is flattened out and outlays are beginning to tick up. In fact, fiscal 2016 marked the first year since 2012 that DoD outlays grew year versus year. As we expected, the new government fiscal year began with a continuing resolution. In less than a week, we will have the uncertainty of the elections behind us, at least we hope so, and that may give us clarity on timing and likely outcomes of future budgetary decisions. We remain confident that Leidos is well-positioned to capture increasing share of the budgets as we continue to focus on solving our customers' most challenging mission-related problems. Onto the quarter. Consolidated revenue of $1.9 billion is up 43% from the prior year, driven by $620 million contributed from IS&GS during the quarter. Organically, legacy Leidos was up 5.1% from Q3 of last year when adjusting for the prior-year period for the divestiture of the heavy construction business. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $0.80 from $0.67, reflecting higher profitability offset by the amortization of acquired intangibles from the IS&GS transaction. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.25 in the quarter, up 71% from the prior-year's period's $0.73, a record for the company since the 2013 spin-off of new SAIC. As we suggested on our last quarter call, we experienced a strong book-to-bill on a consolidated basis during the third quarter at 1.6. This reflects not only a strong level of awards at the end of the government fiscal year, but also market share gains. We generated cash from operations of $226 million during the quarter, better than expected, allowing us in September to pay down $100 million on our term loans used to finance the closing of the IS&GS transaction. This payment was ahead of schedule and could accelerate our timeline to a more flexible capital deployment posture. As I indicated earlier, our integration process is going well. Jim will provide more details shortly, but we are ahead of the plan on our cost synergy timeline and delivered notable milestones in our integration activities during the quarter. Most important, during the quarter, we added 15,000 new employees to our organization and I could not be more impressed with the level of collaboration, partnership and focus of our combined organization. Cultural fit is often the most difficult aspect of large transactions, and based upon on my past experiences, I am pleased with how smoothly our cultures are combining. I want to publicly welcome our new employees and congratulate all of our now 33,000 talented and dedicated employees on a job well done this quarter. Of course, there is still a lot we need to do to ensure the long-term success of the acquisition. But I am pleased with the progress to-date, and continue to be excited about the new company. With that, let me hand the call over to Jim Reagan, Leidos' Chief Financial Officer for more details on the quarter and our outlook. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Roger, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. As Roger indicated, the quarter results were very positive and reflected strong bookings and operating results of the combined business. Excluding the impact of the IS&GS results and our prior divestitures, the top-line grew 5.1%, while the IS&GS results contributed revenue for the seven-week period that exceeded expectations. I'll get into the segment results in just a moment. GAAP operating income of $101 million is $7 million higher than the prior-year's level, reflecting the IS&GS contribution during the period, offset by associated transaction-related charges. Non-GAAP operating income of $177 million reflects $125 million of profit from the legacy Leidos business and $52 million from the IS&GS business yielding operating margin of 10% and 8.4%, respectively. Non-GAAP results exclude the effect of transaction-related amortization and expenses and other items detailed on slide 14 of the presentation available on our website. The strong operating margin of the legacy Leidos business reflects broad-based strength in our National Security and Health and Infrastructure sectors. And, I'll provide more details on that shortly. Also during the quarter, we incurred a lower than normal tax rate driven by a few discrete items, most notably, the deductibility of the special dividend paid to our employee benefit accounts. For the quarter, our effective tax rate was 4.6%, reflecting a tax benefit of $38 million related to the portion of the special dividend paid to shares held by our employee benefit plans. Without this benefit, our tax rate would have been approximately 30% of non-GAAP pre-tax income. Slide 16 of our Investor Presentation on our website provides more detail on our GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision and tax rates. And, I'll have more on full-year tax expectations in a moment. Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.25 compared to $0.73 a year ago. Non-GAAP operating income and EPS excludes the impact of integration and business restructuring costs related to our acquisition of IS&GS. On this basis, the IS&GS business contributed about $0.07 of EPS for the quarter after reflecting the impact of the incremental shares and debt issued in connection with the transaction. The impact of the tax benefit of the special dividend was approximately $0.10 for the quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter is based on a weighted average of 114 million fully diluted shares outstanding for the period. This reflects the issuance of approximately 77 million new shares on August 16 in conjunction with the closing of the transaction with IS&GS. Fully diluted share count as of the end of the third quarter is approximately 152 million shares. Cash flow from operations of $226 million reflects strong government year-end collections, as well as some working capital timing items, which we expect to reverse in the fourth quarter. As you can expect, our contracts teams have been working with their customer counterparts to implement required contract changes on legacy IS/GS programs that enable our bills to be readily approved and paid by customers. This is a multi-quarter process and there is more hard work and potential impact that we have factored into our previously-issued cash flow guidance. Let me spend a moment discussing our sector results. Our National Security Sector (sic) [National Security Solutions], or NSS, results grew 4.9% over the prior-year period, driven primarily by growth in our international business. Operating margins in NSS were strong at 9.9%, primarily reflecting achievement of contract milestones which allowed us to record profit write-ups on a couple of programs. Revenue in our Health and Infrastructure Sector declined 21.5% due to the sale of our heavy construction engineering business in the second quarter of this year. Now, if you exclude the impact of the sale of that business, HIS grew 8.3%, driven primarily by the continued growth in the Defense Health Agency GENESIS program to modernize the DoD's healthcare record system. Non-GAAP operating margins in HIS of 12.8% during the quarter reflects strength in our Federal Health business and the sale of our low-margin design build business earlier this year. The year-over-year improvement in margins also benefited from the elimination of losses on the Plainfield facility and bad debt expenses on the Gradient project which were reflected in the year-ago period. The IS&GS business earned $620 million in revenue in the period from August 16 through September 30, slightly better than our expectations. Now, please note that for your modeling purposes, we have provided management estimates of historical revenue and operating income for IS&GS on slide 12 of the presentation appendix. Non-GAAP operating margins in our IS&GS sector were 8.4% consistent with our estimates and reflects some early impacts from the elimination of corporate allocations and pension costs that burdened the business prior to the merger. Today, both the legacy Leidos and IS&GS businesses are already benefiting from a reduced cost structure and those benefits of scale will increase as we continue with our integration process that will increase efficiencies and reduce costs. We closed the quarter with excellent liquidity with $449 million of cash on hand plus full availability of our $750 million revolver. Our debt position at the end of the quarter was $3.5 billion, reflecting the $100 million pay down on one of our term loans that Roger mentioned. Shortly after the closing we executed a series of interest rate swap transactions which took advantage of the favorable market conditions, enabling us to fix $1.15 billion of aggregate term loans and an effective cash interest rate of 3.3%. Our integration with the legacy Lockheed IS&GS business is proceeding well and on schedule. We are tracking ahead of our cost take out objectives at this point in the integration process and as of the end of the third quarter; we have already achieved our full-year 2016 cost reduction target. We have named our leadership to the second level below the CEO and have developed detailed plans and timelines for the migration of significant IT systems. Notably, in early October, we completed a major upgrade to the Deltek Accounting and Financial Management System as a precursor to consolidating the legacy IS&GS systems on to our platform. This consolidation which is planned for year-end 2017 is expected to yield significant process in cash flow improvement and enable much of the cost synergies planned for 2018, and beyond. With more than 30% of our target annual cost synergies already achieved and our IT systems consolidation going smoothly thus far, we remain confident that we will achieve our planned cost savings of $471 million on a run rate basis by early 2018. Now onto guidance. As a result of the strong performance year-to-date, we are raising our 2016 revenue and EPS guidance, while reiterating our cash flow guidance. We now expect revenues for the full year in the range of $7.0 billion to $7.1 billion, up from our prior range of $6.8 billion to $7.0 billion. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS within a range of $350 billion to $360 billion from a prior range of $315 billion to $335 billion, reflecting a $0.30 increase at the midpoint. Please note that due to the timing and magnitude of the new share issuance in the middle of Q3, the full-year EPS results for 2016 will not equal the sum of the four quarters. The share count used for the full-year results must be properly weighted to reflect the share issuance. And we've provided some details to help you model this effect in slide 11 of the presentation appendix available on our website. We continue to expect cash flow from continuing operations to be at or above $275 million, reflecting largely flat Q4. In conclusion, we are pleased with the strong performance of the combined business, and we are tracking well relative to our commitments on driving synergies from the transaction and creating value for our shareholders. The focus and collaboration of our 33,000 employees was instrumental in producing these results and it gives me great confidence in the future. So with that, Rob, let's now open it up, so that we can take some questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thank you very much, and good results. So first question, so tax rate for the year, where is that expected to be now? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: The full-year tax rate will be about 26% and that reflects the non-GAAP tax rate that we had of 4.6% in Q3. The fourth quarter tax rate we're expecting to return to a normalized rate of about 38%. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Got it. Okay. And could you tell us at NSS those margins look particularly good. How large were the favorable adjustments? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, the way I would think of this, Cai, is that these favorable adjustments were really \u2013 these were triggered on the achievement of certain contract milestones. And if we had our druthers, we certainly would have spread those. But the number is in the 20% \u2013 in the 20%s, but the thing that I would want to emphasize is that these really \u2013 these adjustments don't change our view that normalized we're expecting that part of the business to move in the direction of a normal 10% run rate margin. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Got it. Okay. And then the last one at HIS, maybe give us some color in terms of security products, how was the shipment mix in the quarter, what we look for, for the fourth quarter and same question on the commercial health, IT business? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Relative to prior quarters, the security products business was relatively light, which you normally \u2013 when you see margins like this you normally would have thought it was a big quarter for shipment. Actually the results were primarily driven by strong program performance in the Federal side of the health business. And this is outside of the DHMSM or DHA GENESIS program. So we had good contract events that led to higher award fees and a couple of good program write-ups over there. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thank you very much. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, good morning, guys. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Jon. Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Shall I take the lack of mention on 2017 guidance in the slides and release as a reiteration or any commentary on how we're tracking those numbers you provided in early August? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: No, I think you ought to take it as a \u2013 essentially a reiteration of our policies that we'll give 2017 guidance at the end of the year like we always do, and so... Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): That's great. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. We have our Investor Day presentation that's out there and we won't touch 2017 guidance until we get to the end of the year. Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Sure. And then just going into the end of the year and just going forward, how are you accounting for the uncertainty and the integration risks, when you think about your expectations going forward. For example, what's embedded in your cash flow outlook for working capital in light of the comments you made about potential innovation issues? And then secondly, how do you account for things like the Department of Energy deal going away from you or the GENESIS ramp being slightly delayed? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Okay, that was a complex question. I'll give you a sort of a top-down view and then Jim can try to provide you some details. So we build an aggregate plan, we look at risk and opportunities and we did that when we put together the presentation for Investor Day and we did that when we updated our guidance. And we build into that a reasonable view of risks and opportunities and both good things and bad things happening, and we come up with a \u2013 I think a reasonable estimate somewhere down the middle of the road. Just specifically on the DHA GENESIS program, I want to make sure that you understand what we said is that relative to revenue, we don't see the program being delayed. What we're doing is we're actually maturing some of the software, we're conducting some more tests, we're doing some cyber scans. And so the installation at the first facility will be a few months later than we had anticipated, but the level of activity is essentially the same. And the entire program if you think about deployment to all of the facilities within the Department of Defense will essentially remain on track. So we'll be a little bit later on the first couple facilities, but we expect to pick that back up as we go into the implementation phase. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. And, John, you had asked about cash flow. A couple of things worth amplifying on that. First of all, the novation process is going well. And so far, we haven't seen any material disruption in the form of higher DSO as a result of that. But it \u2013 we're still fairly early in the process and there is still a lot of more work to do as I mentioned on the call. And so to fully answer your question, we've baked in the possibility that there are a couple of speed bumps that occur as contracts, they haven't yet novated and then the customer's billing office gets a different kind of bill that has to get processed especially during that novation. So we're thinking that there might be a two-day to three-day DSO bump that is factored into how we're thinking about cash flow that we've previously guided, too, for Q4, as well as into 2017. Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Sorry for the multi-part of it. Thanks a lot. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Okay. Great. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Jon. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Congrats on a great start here. Could you talk a little bit about staffing challenges. We hear more and more about the difficulty in finding clear personnel with the new tech skills and cyber skills that are increasingly in demand. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: We know, Ed, that's always a challenge, especially when we're talking about maybe the Baltimore-Columbia area, where there are a lot of contractors and a huge need for computer science skills, probably Java in particular, with what we call a lifestyle polygraph. And it's just a requirement to do certain kinds of work, and we're all competing and we're all competing for the same talent base. We're pleased with our success. Frankly, the acquisition of Lockheed's business creates a larger entity and more professional growth for employees who want to join the company, and I think we've already seen more interest in our recruiting activities than when we were standalone Leidos. One way people are dealing with that is trying to do that work away from the customer facility, and there has been some success that some of those customers, that particular customer has some other facilities around the country, where if you have an operation there, you can move some of the work away from the National Capital Region. But I think we would all admit is it's a bit of a challenge and if you've son or daughter who is thinking about a career and is going to University of Maryland, a computer science degree is probably a good decision. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Can you talk a little bit about bids outstanding? Your revenue number came in actually a little light of what we were expecting, though you raised the full-year guide for $100 million \u2013 by $100 million. So is there some good things kicking in quickly here, sort of what sort of maybe some sense of the timing and why the strength expected in Q4? Thanks. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, Ed, I'm not sure of how you got to your number because when we put our prior guide together, the number we were thinking about relative to our prior guide was a little bit lighter than where we came in at. But with that said, we have had some recent wins that we are expecting are going to put a little bit more run rate into the business, which is reflected in kind of the implicit when you do the math, where you're looking at something north of $2.5 billion of revenue for Q4, which is certainly consistent with we're a little bit better than the guidance that we previously issued at Investor Day. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Congrats. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Good morning. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Rob. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, just wanted to follow-up on Ed's question there, how do we think about the segments, as we go into the end of the year, relative to what you just said? And then more specifically on IS&GS in the quarter, it seems like the revenue was a little front-end weighted given that the deal closed right in the middle of the quarter, I think about 54% of the sales were pre-deal and 46% post-deal? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Sure, Rob. What I would say is, let me take your second half of the question first. The way we think about the weighting was that, at the end \u2013 there is two things going on. At the end of the ownership period of Lockheed, they did a lot of contract closeouts that caused an \u2013 a bit of an updraft in the revenue recognized on certain programs, those contracts were closed out and put to bed. There was both a revenue and a profit updraft. The second piece that I would tell you is that, we had an impact, it wasn't huge but it was \u2013 it had a bit of an impact on revenue and margin that is due to what we call conforming accounting adjustments. So at the closing day, we have to take all of their major programs, zero the EACs out and treat them like they are day one and begin recognizing that revenue on the accounting policies of Leidos. And so there was a bit of an impact there and the \u2013 we would estimate a drag on margin less than a 100 bps, but it is also a short-term drag that because of the way the accounting works, it tails off through the end of \u2013 if we estimate it will tail off through the end of this year and it has to do with contract contingency reserves that we are not able to carry over into our balance sheet. To answer your question about how we're thinking about segments, clearly, both NSS and AGS had really, really great quarters because of a confluence of contingency releases and contract milestones that drove a little bit above normal margins, but we're expecting them to settle back to how we previously guided. Now, one thing I would also point out is that, as Roger said, we have launched the design of our new organization and we're in the midst of implementing the organization that we previously named and that process will be fully baked in to how we're running the business through the fourth quarter. And at the beginning of 2017, we'll have a new segmentation that will effectively distribute the IS&GS business and take the legacy Leidos business and line it up along customer market basis. And we'll have more to say about that in the fourth quarter. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hey Rob, I would add, and you can dig this out of our chart, page eight in the presentation is that even the IS&GS book-to-bill for the six weeks is 1.2, and so it's really strong performance across all three of our reported sector, all significantly north of 1. So really nice performance even for that short stub period that we had post closing. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Roger, that actually dovetails right into my next question which is looking at your slide 12, second quarter IS&GS was just under $1.3 billion, that is \u2013 is that the low watermark here? You're higher than that in the third quarter. But of course you had the Lockheed closeouts. But on the other hand, you mentioned the 1.2 book-to-bill, so has the pro forma organic growth did that bottom in Q2 for IS&GS? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, a couple of things. First, we don't guide at the segment level. And so we're not going to give you a specific number. We did certainly in the Investor Day talk about where we thought IS&GS was trending, and I think we indicated when we thought it would turnaround and start to grow. And I think generally in the Investor Day, we looked at that more in 2017 than in 2016. And I don't think we want to be more specific than that. Other than the whole tone of I think the release and this call is, we have increased our confidence across the board, and just feel really good about the numbers that we've got out. But we're not giving any more specificity on the segments. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. I'm going to try one more then, but this is back on NSS. You had the 5% growth but you've mentioned it was international. What's going on, on the domestic side? And again your book-to-bills are strong, so when do we see growth there? Or am I asking \u2013 basically barking up the same tree, I just tried to bark up? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, there is a bit of barking up the same tree. But I'll let Jim, see if he can at least give you a little bit more information. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. We did indeed say that it was international. We had really strong bookings in the last quarter and year-to-date in the domestic side. So when you think about revenue across the sector including international going up and that book-to-bill is well north of 1, and in the quarter, in the 1.6-ish range. What we can tell you is that the domestic part of NSS that drives higher margins has had good growth in backlog in the last quarter, and we're thinking that, that bodes well for how the growth in the domestic side of the business will go as well. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Just one last clarification question. On the $0.25 increase in guidance at the two ends, $0.07 is clearly the tax related gain. I just want to clarify what the rest of that is? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: The rest of it is performance. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): It's all performance. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: The business is performing well. Yeah. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. That's it. Thank you both. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thanks. Thanks, Rob. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bill Loomis with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions. William Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning and good quarter. See, just going back to the question on the margins for the segments, clearly it was a pretty material change on NSS in particular, now as you mentioned some write-ups, what was the 20%s number you gave, what were you referring to on that? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Without being specific on programs because I really can't be specific on programs Bill, these were contract milestones, these were things we were waiting to happen that enabled us to recognize revenue on some contingent events that are \u2013 they're really milestone-driven revenue recognition. And we kind of alluded to this in the second quarter when you might remember Bill, we had a little bit of a light margin quarter, and that was because the \u2013 we had some profit that was hung up and certain things happening, and those things have now happened. William Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So when we were looking at the modeling, I mean you had mentioned trend towards 10% in the future, I don't \u2013 if you can clarify what timeframe you are thinking about with NSS, routinely getting 10% tight margins. But second of all, just for this year, so we should look at second quarter as being abnormally low and then you had that reversal in the third quarter, are we still generally looking at roughly a kind of a 8% trend in the group or is it going to be higher? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I think 8% is a good way to think about it in the short run, but we've got, what we said in Investor Day, was our aspiration is to get the whole business including NSS closer to a 10% number and that we believe is achievable with the business mix we've got as well as the achievement of the cost take-outs that are on schedule for this year and beyond through to the run rate and the beginning of 2018. William Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, can you give some comments on the UK contract, how that's performing and was that one of the contracts responsible for the uptick in margin in the quarter? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, that contract is not a material part of the uptick in margin, Bill. But I would say that it is \u2013 it's a complex program and as we continue to execute, I'd say that on balance we're pleased with how things are working. Roger, do you have anything else to say? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Let's see, I don't want you to read into the word complex, that we have any concerns, actually the program is performing really, really well, and we have a great relationship with the customer and the construction of the large warehouse called the Defense Fulfillment Center is on track and be completed this year. But it \u2013 when we first introduced the program, we talked about that the margin would grow over time and we're still confident that's going to happen and that's how the program is performing. And the team in the UK are doing a fantastic job and we've actually already started to save the MOD money and we're hoping that because of our performance that program will expand even beyond our expectations. And so it's just a terrific program and we're really privileged to have that one. William Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: You said the Fulfillment Center completed this year, is that ahead of schedule, because I thought I heard before it was like next spring-summer? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, the construction will be completed this year and then \u2013 I don't want to dive off into a program review, but \u2013 so the physical fulfillment center will be complete and then we have to get those software complete and we have consolidate inventory and then we have to go through checkout and things. And so that will go on for several months significantly into next year. But if you drove by Downingtown you'd see this absolutely fantastic two new warehouse buildings at least today from the outside look almost complete, but there's still a fair amount of systems and physical build-out that has to be done between now and the end of the year. William Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then just on the margin on HIS, obviously good improvement here. You mentioned the big change from year-over-year, it doesn't sound like GENESIS had an impact, raising that margin from your description. But help me on the commercial healthcare business, did that have an impact on boosting the margin, is that improving on a revenue and profitability side on the commercial electronic healthcare record system business? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, Bill, in the commercial side, it is becoming a less material part of the business just because the rest of this sector is growing on the Federal side. But with that said, the commercial health business is performing well. We said before that the revenue is holding well, it's growing a little bit, we're experiencing good bookings there and program margins are performing well in addition to that. William Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So it's not \u2013 the commercial business isn't necessarily causing the double-digit margins and GENESIS isn't either, so what is it? Is it just true-ups on some of the non-GENESIS DoD contracts? What kind of run rates should we be thinking about on margin on that business? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, I don't think that it changes the long-term view that we've expressed which is in the 8%-ish. We've said before that the DHA business is accretive to our overall health margins, okay? And that as I said before, the margin on that program hasn't changed and it wasn't responsible for the drive up to 12.8%. What is, is other programs that are in the Federal Health business. So we have a number of other programs that serve the VA and then they also serve the defense health business and we've achieved some contract milestones that have brought the margin up for Q3 as well. William Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Okay. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tobey Sommer with SunTrust Robinson. Please proceed with your question. Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. I was wondering if you could speak to the prospects for new projects in the healthcare record space in the \u2013 in your public healthcare business, particularly as you may be positioned relative to the VA if they eventually move forward and decided try to modernize their systems? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, we'll talk a little bit Tobey about sort of what's going on in the VA, but I will tell you my ability to predict the future will be a lot better a week from now maybe. See there is \u2013 I think, let's start with the basics. I don't think anyone would disagree that in the near-term, the VA will go through some modernization. And I think the VA is in the middle of a study trying to ascertain whether they continue with their essentially in-house legacy system, which is a [MinX] database where they go with a more of a commercial off-the-shelf system and the VA hasn't made that decision yet. And I think it would be actually a considerable amount of time, maybe into the next administration before they make a decision. With the acquisition of IS&GS, they had won a kind of a precursor to a new EHR/EMR program, which is a scheduling program and that has some potential I think to get funded and to kickoff and to be more significant part of our VA portfolio in the future, but we'll just see how that particular program fits into the overall strategy, and that isn't an electronic healthcare records so much per se, but it is scheduling, which is one of the challenges that VA has, which is getting vets in and out of care facilities. Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. And sticking with this theme relative to the GENESIS contract is, should we be thinking about for modeling purposes a little bit of a slowdown in growth when that enters the testing phase or is that not a big concern given the size of the segment overall? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Okay. So we've talked to the DHA GENESIS program in the past, and we have said that, we have to configure the software, we go through test, we could go through some initial installations and the customer uses the software for the greater portion of a year, and then when they are to the point they are comfortable, and they like the way the workflows operate, and user interface, then we move into a more aggressive deployment process. And we still view the program that way, we don't see really any change to the way it's configured. So given what we have said in the past, this is \u2013 there is not a slow down, there is not a delay, but we did describe that there would be a probably a lower revenue in the next year, and then it picks up and \u2013 but that configuration is very consistent with the guidance we've given you in the past. Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much for your help. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yes. You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Amit Singh with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Amit Singh - Jefferies LLC : Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Earlier, you had put out a cost saving target, I think on the gross level of around $25 million in fiscal 2016, I think reaching $175 million in 2017, and then going from there reaching $350 million in fiscal 2019. You earlier mentioned that you've already achieved your fiscal 2016 target. And there's still time to go in the year. So is there an update there for \u2013 especially for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. We're not ready to say exactly what the number is going to be, but it's going to be well north of the $25 million that we had indicated before. And the integration process in many ways got kicked off before we closed Amit, which is how we were able to overachieve on that. So what does that mean for our confidence in next year's target? Obviously, if you've got a good head start, you're feeling a lot better about our ability to achieve that, and to hit the numbers. The big things that we have to do relative to achieving those targets in the coming year is system related. There are a lot of system enablers that will enable us to reduce IT costs and consolidate operations. And those are proceeding well, very well for us and certainly are on schedule, where normally you think of those as having schedule risks. So we've done our upgrade that gets us ready to begin the process of porting over the lion's share of the back-office systems from IS&GS over to what we have. The one other thing that I would comment on where we're expecting to have a significant amount of cost savings is in real estate consolidation and those plans are also proceeding apace. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: And let me just add to the color there. First of all, we're really pleased. We had established what we call an integration management office and it was jointly populated by Leidos people and folks from IS&GS, but of course no actual integration or any actual activity happened prior to closing, but we were able to put some fairly detailed plans in place so that the day after closing, we were able to hit the ground running and that's really given us a fast start starting on the August 17 to achieve our integration objectives. Amit Singh - Jefferies LLC : Great. And then as you look at your integration plan, which involves the systems, people, facilities, if you could put a percent of what percent of this overall integration is complete right now and any sort of timeline on when do you expect to say that okay most of the integration has done here? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, what a very complex question? Yeah. What you may be interested, we have a number that we put out at about $350 million in value capture and we've given you some numbers year-to-date. You could use that as a percentage. Really it's people organization, it's systems, it's real estate, it's just really, really complex. There will be integration activities that occur well into a calendar year 2018 and just getting some of the general ledgers brought together and some of the back-office systems. We expect to do, probably the HR system in 2017 and we'll probably merge into a smaller number of general ledgers, perhaps probably on the annual close at the end of 2017 and beginning of 2018. But we could see a continued activity well into 2018, but on a percentage basis, I don't \u2013 we don't really track it in that way and so I don't have a number for you. Amit Singh - Jefferies LLC : All right. Thank you very much. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I will turn the floor back to Kelly Hernandez for closing remarks. Kelly P. Hernandez - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you all for joining us on our earnings call today. We look forward to sharing more updates with you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.",

Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Leidos Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Results. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kelly P. Hernandez, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Hernandez. Kelly P. Hernandez - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; and Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the Leidos management team. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter ending December 30, 2016. Roger Krone will lead off the call with comments on the market environment and our company strategy. Jim will follow with a discussion of our financial performance and our expectations for the future. After these remarks from Roger and Jim, we'll open the call for your questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, during the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in the press release that we issued this morning, and is also available in the presentation slides. The press release and presentation, as well as the supplementary financial information file are provided on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.leidos.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Kelly, and thank you all for joining us this morning for our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 earnings conference call. 2016 was a transformative year for Leidos and I'm pleased with our successes in the year and the path that we are on for the future. Financially, we grew revenue 38% from the prior year, reflecting the revenue contribution of the IS&GS acquisition. We improved adjusted EBITDA margin by 60 basis points and non-GAAP diluted EPS by 19% versus the prior year. We exited the year with $18 billion in backlog, nearly 2 times our annual revenue. We generated $446 million of cash from operations in the year or 1.8 times our net income. We also distributed $1.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders and accelerated repayments of $275 million of our acquisition-related debt during the year. These successes and the strength of our business give us confidence to raise our prior guidance levels for revenue, margin and earnings for 2017, which Jim will detail later. Operationally, we accomplished a lot during the year. We completed the acquisition of the IS&GS business from Lockheed Martin and made significant progress towards integration. We also completed the divestiture of our heavy construction engineering business, which was dilutive to our margins and not part of our go-forward strategy. We remain focused on performing well on our programs for our customers, enabling a substantial level of award fees in the year. On our high visibility programs, DHMSM and LCST, we continued to perform well and engaged closely with our customers as we further the progress on these long-duration programs. Just recently, we reached an important milestone on the DHMSM program as we stood up operation of the new MHS Genesis system in the first initial operation capability, or IOC, site in the DoD network. The go-live date on this was February 7 at Fairchild Air Force Base. Our team performed well on this milestone and the feedback from the customer has been very positive. The remaining IOC sites are on track to go live in the spring to summer timeframe. We have also fully integrated the IS&GS and Leidos people, enabling a collaborative culture which we expect will generate positive dividends, particularly our business development efforts. Expanding on this a bit, we have been very focused on driving the benefits from this transaction through our business development process. We have revamped our business development initiatives to bring a more disciplined approach to each capture, focused on improving three key metrics : the size of our qualified pipeline of new business; win rates on proposals, particularly for new work; and the efficiency of our bid and proposal spending. In the five months since we closed the transaction, we have already completed integration of the BD staff to enable the synergies from the transaction to be leveraged in all bids going into customers. We have focused heavily on investing in our people through training; modernizing their workplace, our proposal development centers; and establishing executive level career tracks for our capture leads. We have also invested in our tools to improve efficiency, collaboration and the effectiveness of our pursuits. While the results of these efforts will take some time to work through the pipeline, we are encouraged with some early signs. We are working on some significant opportunities that neither legacy Leidos nor legacy IS&GS would have bid independently in the past that overtime can contribute to our stated revenue synergy targets. These opportunities are at various stages of maturity across multiple markets and I'll just highlight a few. As we discussed at our Investor Day in August, IS&GS brought over some very strong qualifications within the enterprise network transformation domain. We are looking at a significant opportunity with an armed service customer that we see as a potential future franchise for us. Neither one of our legacy companies would have bid this job for various reasons : cost structure, customer intimacy, past performance qualifications. However, when we looked at this one, it really did come together like two pieces of a puzzle and the acquisition has enabled us to put together a truly compelling bid. Within the civil domain, we are pursuing a large enterprise network protection opportunity which, prior to the merger, would probably not have been a prime bid for us. On this capture we were able to look across our new joint portfolio and identify some key internal R&D investments that we believe fill a critical customer need while also creating a differentiator for our proposed solution. One final effort I'd like to highlight, we have a biometrics proposal and evaluation for one of our armed service customers. As a result of the acquisition and the biometrics capabilities that came over with the deal, we were able to significantly improve our competitive position through the technical innovations and past performance on (07:54) contracts. These are just a few of the examples and, in each case, we are optimistic that the new Leidos is better positioned to compete and could contribute to our revenue synergy targets. Subsequent to the close of the year, we also cleared protest gates on two important program wins. The first of these is the FAA program where we improve airport terminal and runway efficiency through the development and deployment of our terminal flight data manager system. The second is the Department of Homeland Security's next-generation enterprise security operation service center contract where we will upgrade the Department's ability to protect its enterprise-wide networks against cyber intruders. Both of these will contribute to revenue in the current year. We are optimistic that we will have more such successes in the future as we leverage our initiatives in cost structure and business development to drive a book-to-bill above one for 2017. In terms of the macro conditions, while an improving budget picture is certainly positive, the appropriations process will take some time to play out. And we believe it is likely to be more impactful to our industry from a revenue perspective in 2018 rather than 2017. For now, the government is operating under continuing resolution through April 28, and there is a fair amount of uncertainty surrounding the possibilities after that date. We are taking a cautious approach with regards to the macro environment until these uncertainties resolve. That said, we are focused on that which is within our control, including our initiatives to improve our cost structure and deliver cost synergies from the transaction. In 2016, we achieved our cost synergy targets of over $200 million analyzed cost synergies exiting the year and are progressing well against our 2017 goals. Jim will expand on this shortly. Additionally, last month, we further streamlined our organization, consolidating down to four business units from five as we distributed our defense business among intelligence and civil segments. This streamlined organization puts us in a better position to extract synergies and enable agility and collaboration as we hope support our customers' missions. We remain focused on delivering value-added solutions to our customers, ensuring a great place to work for our employees, and maximizing the return for our shareholders. With that, let me hand the call over to Jim Reagan, Leidos' Chief Financial Officer, for more details on the quarter and our outlook. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Roger, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. Roger provided the highlights of our full-year detail, so I will focus my remarks on our fourth quarter performance and on our outlook. We had positive developments on many fronts in the fourth quarter with higher revenue, margins, cash flow and bookings as compared to the prior year period. As Roger indicated, we met our cost synergy target for the year and this was a great quarter by many measures, even more so during a period of such transition for the organization. Consolidated revenues were $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year period. This represented an organic growth rate of 4.5% when adjusting for the acquisition of IS&GS and the divestiture of our heavy construction business. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 9.5%, an improvement of 50 basis points from the prior year's level. This improvement was driven by cost reductions already embedded in our business plus strong results in our core operations within our NSS and HIS sectors which I'll touch on further momentarily. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter of 40% was three points higher than our expectations due to yearend true ups. For the full year our non-GAAP tax rate was 27%, lower than our normal effective rate in large part due to the tax treatment of the special dividend. Non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations, as detailed on slide 15 of the investor presentation, was $0.75 per share on a basis of 153 million shares outstanding in the fourth quarter. Note that the share count in the quarter and for the full year was 1 million higher than our prior expectations, reflecting the greater dilutive impact of our outstanding options due to our higher share price. The combination of the higher tax rate and the higher share count reduced our fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS by $0.04. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share primarily excludes the impact of $54 million of amortization charges and $22 million of acquisition and integration costs. Operating cash flow from continuing operations of $162 million was a highlight in the quarter. Our focus on collections drove a nice decrease in the DSO level exiting the quarter to 58 days, reflecting a seven-day decline for the year. As we have suggested in the past, the process of novating contracts from IS&GS over to Leidos is a critical activity relative to collections. And while our team has delivered a great fourth quarter, we're still a couple of quarters away from our contracts being fully novated, so we continue to manage this very closely to minimize any potential impact to our cash flow. Overall, for the year, cash flow from operations of $446 million reflects significant focus and great accomplishments by our team. Note that this also reflects $90 million in acquisition and integration expenses. Our strong performance here enabled us to pay down an additional $175 million of our acquisition debt in Q4, in addition to the $100 million we paid down in Q3. These post-close reductions bring our leverage ratio down to 3.5% from our post-close level of about 3.8% in mid August. As we indicated in a press release a few weeks ago, we were able to go back to the markets and secure better pricing on our $1.1 billion Term Loan B due to our performance post-close as well as favorable market conditions. In addition, we anticipate that our Term Loan A pricing rates will also go down subject to the pricing grid incorporated in those agreements. This is expected to take effect once we file our quarterly financial compliance at the end of this month. In combination, these two modifications will drive a 25-basis point reduction in our blended interest rate to 4.04%, saving about $8 million in interest expense annually. Our overall debt portfolio is now 47% floating and 53% fixed. Our expected reductions to debt resulting from operating cash flow in the coming year will further reduce our exposure to floating rate debt. We closed the year by capturing over $200 million in annualized gross cost synergies. We took significant actions in workforce, process and real estate to drive approximately $90 million of these total cost synergies to complement the savings from the elimination of corporate overhead burdens from the Lockheed cost structure. As we are already nearly two months into 2017, we are well on our way to executing on our plans to achieve our target of $296 million in gross cost synergies by the end of 2017. Many of this year's savings will be driven by systems migrations, which are dispersed throughout the year primarily related to our human capital management systems and our IT backbone for the IS&GS business, which will be pulled away from Lockheed at the end of the year. The cost synergy targets which we discussed at our Analyst Day in August are still reasonable and very much achievable in the same timeframe, which we originally estimated. That estimate remains a total gross level of $471 million which includes $121 million of day one savings and $350 million of additional cost synergies which we are now driving through our integration process. This lower cost structure is already being leveraged in our business development initiatives and can have an impact on win rates as early as this quarter. With that, shifting to business development results, we experienced a typical seasonal quarter on consolidated net bookings which totaled $1.84 billion in the fourth quarter for a book to bill ratio of 0.7. For the year consolidated net bookings were $6.95 billion, resulting in a book to bill ratio of 1.0. As we've noted before, bookings and backlog do not include the effect of either single or multiple-award IDIQs until task orders are awarded under those by our customers. The value of bids outstanding at the end of the fourth quarter was $28 billion, up slightly from Q3 levels. Now let me spend a moment on sector results for Q4. First, in our national security sector, revenues of $876 million increased 3% year-over-year primarily due to revenues associated with our international business and increases in fees resulting from the achievement of milestones on certain contracts. Operating margins in our national security sector were 7.8%, roughly in line with the prior year's level as higher fees from certain contracts were offset by lower scope and some completion of others. In our Health and Infrastructure Sector, revenues were $348 million in Q4 compared to $432 million in the prior year period. When adjusting the prior period lower by $110 million to exclude the revenues from our heavy construction business which we divested this year, revenue growth in the sector was 8%. This organic revenue growth primarily reflects increased sales in our federal health business. Non-GAAP operating margins for the Health and Infrastructure Sector grew approximately 240 basis points to 13.5% from the prior year period. A robust level of security product shipments contributed to this quarter's margin strength while the divestiture of the heavy construction business was the key contributor to the year-over-year improvement. Now moving to our IS&GS sector. Revenues in IS&GS were $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter with non-GAAP operating margins of 10.4%. Non-GAAP operating margins exclude the impact of $53 million of amortization of intangibles from the transaction. The focus on program execution that the IS&GS team has maintained throughout the transition into Leidos has been remarkable. The team's constant focus on the customer's mission and their cooperation and collaboration during the integration process reinforces the promise we see in the transaction and in our combination. Looking ahead, we start the new year with a healthy cash balance of $376 million. We have historically held a disciplined capital management philosophy, which balances a number of options to include regular and special dividends, organic growth investments and M&A, as well as debt pay down and share repurchase. Given the strong level of cash flow from operations, our improved debt pricing, and the higher than level expected of debt paydown at this point post-close, we are once again returning to a position of more flexibility in our capital deployment options. We remain committed to paying our regular quarterly dividend and, beyond that, we review with our board options for the deployment of excess cash including special dividends, organic growth investments, M&A, as well debt paydown and share repurchase. This provides us with the flexibility to take advantage of market conditions to lower our cost of capital while also driving increased value for our shareholders and an improved competitive position for the company long term. As Roger indicated, we are still taking a cautious approach from a macro perspective relative to the outlays in effect in 2017. However, the strong results we delivered in 2016, combined with our performance as a combined entity post-close, give us confidence in raising our expectations for 2017 relative to the targets that we previewed with you at our August 2016 investor conference. For 2017, we expect revenue in the range of $10.0 billion to $10.4 billion, up from our prior range of $9.8 billion to $10.2 billion. We expect EBITDA margin in the range of 9.5% to 10%, up from the prior range of 9.0% to 10.0%. And we are raising our expectation for non-GAAP earnings per share to a range of $3.05 to $3.35, up from $2.90 to $3.20. For cash flow from operations, we are reiterating our prior target for the year of at or above $475 million. Please note that our cash flow from operations guidance includes the impact of $75 million from cash needed to fund our integration initiatives, meaning that our true cash flow run rate for this business is at or above $550 million for the year. For your modeling purposes, we would suggest a share count of 154 million fully diluted shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of 37%. We expect interest expense of approximately $145 million for the year, reflecting today's LIBOR rates and the improved spreads that we secured in our recent debt restructuring. Assuming our current fixed floating mix, every 10 basis point increase in the LIBOR rate would have an approximate $1 million impact to our annual interest expense. In conclusion, I'm pleased with our performance in the quarter and for the full year and I'm encouraged that through the actions that we're taking on our cost structure and our customer offerings, Leidos will have an unmatched position in the market. So with that, Rob, let's open it up, so that we can take some questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you very much and good quarter. Roger, you talked about we might see in the first quarter some benefit of your joint bids and you also have these two protested awards that will basically come in in the quarter. Could you give us, A, how big are those awards in terms of what they might add to the year and their size; and secondly, give us some more color on what sorts of bids we might see from kind of joint bidding opportunities in the first quarter? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Okay. Yes, I probably can talk a little bit about that. The two bids were both in the hundreds of millions and I have to look \u2013 I think together they may be $500 million total. But that's over a period of performance, probably has an impact of like $30 million or so. But, Cai, rather than being specific on some of the joint bids and how it phases into the pipeline, I would just tell you, we were at 1.0 in 2016 and I think our trend will be healthily north of that because of the synergy and some of the work that's coming together. And the other point I would like to make is, although we have a whole pipeline or whole series of campaigns, and I could \u2013 we actually have a model where we go through specific campaigns, I really don't like to talk about those per se because of the competitive nature of what we're bidding on and when we decide to go forward with a bid and when not. But what I'm simply trying to do in my comments is to point to real tangible programs that we will now bid that we would not have bid as the old Leidos. And in talking with Gerry Fasano on our BD team, it's not clear that IS&GS would have bid those as the old Lockheed either. I don't know if that helps a lot. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes, that helps. So really what I'm getting at is a recent conference, a number of companies said we might see a slower beginning to the year because of the administration transition with kind of limits on head count at the Pentagon, some limits on EPA, but a pickup later in the year as a result of incremental O&M spending for readiness. Could you give us some color \u2013 how do you see the pattern of the year of kind of bookings, just general sense? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Look, Cai, I clearly understand why people have that view. I think it may be different depending upon where you are in the bid cycle. There is a lot of awards that we expect to happen in the first quarter, things that have gotten sort of delayed from last year, and this bid process is multi-year and the things that are getting awarded now were put in place 12, 18 months ago. And we don't see the change in the administration or the lack of confirmed acquisition execs in the Pentagon for instance, actually slowing down the process. And in fact, if I read General Mattis' comments correctly, I think he wants to spend more money in what we call shorter-term dollars to help things like readiness, O&M and what have you. And that might actually lead to on-contract growth for some existing programs if you already have a contract that supports the fielded equipment. And so, I would tell you that, yeah, we're always cyclical and with fourth quarter always being our worst, but we have not seen that drawdown or slowdown of awards. And frankly, there are a couple other bids that are in protest. We expect those to get cleaned up as well. So we're looking towards what we think will be a strong first and second quarter and then, of course, third quarter is always our strongest, Cai. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Jim, thanks for providing the color on the cash flow this year. But could you just add a couple more specifics in terms of how much of this year's outperformance do you feel came from working capital timing versus perhaps accelerated integration benefit? And what does that say about the building blocks heading into 2017? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Jon, I don't know that we want to get \u2013 because there are so many moving parts on the margin picture, I don't know if it is helpful to get into specifics kind of dissecting that. What I would tell you though is that the bulk of the over-performance on cash came from a couple things. One, continued really hard driving from both the legacy IS&GS team as well as the Leidos team in getting bills done faster and riding herd on collections. The second piece was we're operating under a TSA with Lockheed for part of the billing and collection activity until we cut it over to our systems. And I have to give a little bit of credit to a lot of cooperation we have had from Lockheed under the TSA to help us drive even faster collections than they were experiencing before. So those two things combined have helped us to drop our DSO by seven days. And we're working hard to make sure that that sticks. Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Are you still thinking about a two to three-day working capital cushion due to those novation items going forward? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. That's how we're modeling it. If we can get novations done faster and get kind of what we have modeled as kind of a temporary blip upward on DSO, if we can get that behind us, obviously, that gives us an opportunity for upside on our cash flow number that we've given you. Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you.. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse : Hi. Good morning. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hey, good morning, Rob. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse : So, I wanted to talk about some of these margins, both looking backward and forward. In HIS, even when you account for the divestiture of the heavy construction business you still had a nice sequential bump up in the quarter. And I think you spoke to that as being somewhat product or mix specific. But I wanted to think about what a normalized margin for both \u2013 for that segment and the others are going forward, maybe how you've contemplated them in the 2017 guidance on a segment basis. And then I have a separate question on the budget. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. So, I will take the margin question, Rob, and then I think Roger will speak to your next question on budget. As you know, we're trying to stay out of the habit of issuing sector guidance, but I can give you some color on what went on in the HIS Group. You're right. The fourth quarter saw some strong product sales that carry higher than \u2013 higher margins than the services business. But it wasn't just that. I think that for the full year, HIS not only enjoyed the margin that you see \u2013 the margin impact from the product shipments, but also we have a couple of legacy programs, large legacy programs in the Health Group that have seen a nice uptick in margins. And that just is grinding it out management of these key programs and getting better management and better profit out of them. So, I would give the health services team credit for that and give the security products guys the credit for delivering some nice shipments in Q4 to help our margin picture there. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse : But are these close out level margins or is this 13% type level something we can count on going forward or is the mix really significant here? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: I wouldn't say that you would want to count on mid-13%s as a sustainable quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter kind of margin in that business. But I also would not want to characterize them as these one \u2013 there is nothing about this is a one-time pick up because we've closed out a contract. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse : I mean, because clearly this is a tale of two halves. You did 9% type numbers in H1 and then 13% in H2. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, and the uptick in margins on a couple of those programs that I was mentioning, those were also part of our second half story. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse : Right. And obviously the construction business was there I guess for a good part of H1. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, that's right. And that was a drag on margin in the first half. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse : Okay. And then any comment you'd like to make on the other two segments from a margin perspective going forward, at least relative to what we've been seeing? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: What I would tell you is that we're pleased with what we see going forward in terms of the ability of our cost reductions to sustain some gradual margin increase. At the same time, is giving us more cash to invest in the important kinds of R&D and product development initiatives that we believe are key to our strategy in growing the business over the long haul. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse : Okay, okay, thanks, Jim. And then, Roger, on the budget, I guess the guidance contemplates what we know and doesn't embed what we don't \u2013 the extras we might get under the new administration. There is talk of upping the OCO from, call it, $65 billion to closer to $95 billion for fiscal 2017. That money could flow somewhat quickly depending on when it happens. And I think there is a lot of readiness focus for that money. How could that benefit the services sector overall and then specifically Leidos on a relative basis? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, Rob, first let me tell you that we are hearing the same thing, although it 's clear that the administration would like to buy more ships and airplanes and tanks. If they put an order in for a new ship, that ship will sail probably long after this administration leaves office. And so there is immediate focus on getting our emission capable rates up to where they should be. And we've heard that from the services chiefs and now from the new Secretary of Defense. The best way for them to do that, given where we are from a budget standpoint, is use the OCO accounts. And I think it does fall appropriately into this wartime readiness kind of a category. We've heard lots of numbers. The number you quoted seems to be at the higher end of the numbers that we've heard. The fastest way for them to do that is to apply those funds to contracts that already exist and to allow the people who are out supporting the warfighter to buy more parts, do more preventative maintenance, do more depo work. We have a variety of programs across all the services that support elements of their warfighting capability from programs frankly in the Mid East in-theatre all the way back to work that we do here in the continental U.S. We don't have a revenue model that says if OCO goes up by $30 million what does that mean to Leidos? I think certainly from your standpoint you ought to just say this is a further positive trend for companies like Leidos and others who primarily perform their business through people. And we are what I call a short dollar and quick spend. And I think the sector overall will do well. And then you tie that into what appears to be a hiring freeze that says in order for those dollars to actually equate to some kind of a mission capable rate, war fighting capability, the fastest way to get it spent is through the contractor community and we are part of that. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse : Okay. And then just to frame it further, because I appreciate your answer. What I am getting at is the 2017 plus up, as you noted, is readiness based, it's going to be in OCO. The 2018 plus ups is going to be base budget, probably not through OCO. That's where I see the ships and the planes or at least most of them. So... Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. It would appear \u2013 let's see, this is a very long and complicated discussion probably not to completely have on this call just because of time, is what the administration will do, they will submit what we call the skinny budget, that will get on the record, then there will be a much more detailed budget. The President is going to have to balance all of his priorities, tax reform, repealing the Affordable Care Act and immigration. And this all gets tied up into tax reform and balance of trade, tariffs and things like that. There are just so many issues that the administration and therefore the Congress and the Senate are dealing with. As I said in my comments, it's still quite complicated and perhaps a little bit difficult to predict. If it was just the DoD alone we'd say, yeah, we're going to see the Budget Control Act repealed. We're going to see the base budget increase, more long dollars spent along with short dollars to increase readiness. But for now, I mean here, we're one month into the administration. I still think it is a little premature to start placing your bets. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse : Okay, fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operating Instructions] The next question today is from the line of Amit Singh with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. Amit Singh - Jefferies LLC : Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Just wanted to get an update on integration. You said you have completed I guess all the integration of business development staff. So if you could provide a brief outline of what all is remaining. And if you could put some sort of a percent on how much percent of total integration is sort of behind you now. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Let me give you a top level, then Jim can maybe come back to numbers overall. So, Amit, what we did on day one is we pulled the people together and we built virtual organizations, right? And we still have the existing legal structure because of the RMT and that will stay in place for at least another year. But for the purposes of trying to drive synergies and integrations we created a management chart where we had new organizations and new people. So we got that done. The functions, we co-located and merged the functions, but because a lot of the IT systems that support the functions are at the back end of integration, we have to operate in parallel. Although like we have one HR organization, we are on two HR platforms. So I think we got all the initial work done. Again, we tailored the organization a little bit more at the end of the year to take some more cost out. In 2017, we actually have a plan, a whole series of projects, and we actually do have what we call earned value management where you measure how we are doing. And think of it as we are sort of a third of the way through those set of projects for the year. And Jim will go to the specifics, but is the IT backbones that we run the company on. Primarily in 2017, we'll be addressing, I think Jim made some comments, our HR platform and our general ledger. And we will convert our HR platform by mid-summer and we will operate a parallel general ledger of Lockheed's in our data center by the fall. And then shortly after the first year we should move to one consolidating general ledger system. And that gets us the majority of the way through integration. Then we have to tick and tie in 2018 and there will be some more staff consolidation and we should be done by the end of 2018. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yes, the only thing \u2013 I mean, Roger captured this all very well actually. And the only thing I think I could add is that a lot of the benefit we're looking for, Amit, in the integration is to get off of the transition services agreement, which will be accomplished by a lot of hard work from our IT teams to get off of the IT backbone. That will happen later this year. And early next year, we will be taking the legacy ERP systems that most of the IS&GS businesses run on. We'll be converting those over to the system that Leidos has been operating on for years. So, the one last piece that is going to be kind of an ongoing initiative that will go in for \u2013 run out for a couple years is the process of tightening up our real estate footprint. And that means aggressively moving out of properties that we see. You can look out of a window in a Leidos office and see another Leidos office down the road that used to be a Lockheed office or vice versa. And so, we're locating our teams in clusters as much as possible and as quickly as possible and getting out from under the cost of these leases. And so, by doing that and by changing the real estate footprint we're expecting to get a lot of value, but again that kicks in over time. Amit Singh - Jefferies LLC : All right. Great. And then just on your 2017 revenue guidance, could you provide what sort of assumption do you have built in for the growth in IS&GS business and non-IS&GS business? And then also just related to beyond fiscal 2017, currently, your commentary was a little \u2013 about the end market was a little cautious for the near mid-term. So what is giving you confidence that you can drive sort of that above 1 book-to-bill this year considering variant CR right now and then that 3% plus \u2013 or 3% type of revenue growth beyond fiscal 2017? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Sure. Well, a lot of questions in that, and then I'll try to unpack it as best I can, Amit. As far as the distinction between kind of how the growth rate is falling out between the two parts of the business, that is \u2013 we have a number of scenarios that we use to build up our guidance. And that shakes out at IS&GS \u2013 our best estimate is that it hits an inflection point and begins year-over-year growth later this year. With the Leidos business, we had a lot of growth in the legacy Leidos business really from the health business, the defense health win that we had, as well as the project in the U.K. And now that those are operating at full tilt and we're starting to \u2013 we've moved beyond IOC on DHMSM and we're starting the roll out there, that flattens out a bit. In fact, that might have a slight dip this year before it starts growing again with more full roll out. On the program in the UK, we're about to deliver a large fulfillment center in the UK there and that has been a big area of growth in the National Security Sector. So that's why we think of the Leidos business having a bit of a flattening for this year. And then back to what we view is secular growth or growth consistent with kind of the secular trend of 3% or better in 2018 and beyond. But again, for this year the guidance that you see reflects that we've got the IS&GS business on a much better and much more competitive cost structure and we are expecting to see that show up in our win rates and in realizing better yield on the pipeline. And then we're going to have continued strong bookings on the Leidos side. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Amit, if I could, just to add some color. The fact that we're going to be in a CR, and I think everyone understands this, is that our normal mode is operating in a CR. I mean, it would be wonderful if we actually get an appropriations bill in April. But for us to say, oh, well, that's \u2013 if we don't get an appropriations bill then things aren't going to move forward. I think everyone in the industry, certainly on the customer side, it's true, has found \u2013 established a process to operate under a CR and get business done. I think one time in the last 10 years we actually had a defense appropriations bill. So let's not wring our hands going into April going, oh, this is \u2013 we won't know what to do. Frankly, this is what we have been doing consistently for a long time. It would be great to get an appropriations bill. I think it's better for our customers. There's more clarity in the system. But we're all certainly prepared to deal appropriately with a CR. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Noah Poponak, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, good morning, everyone. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hi, Noah. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hi, Noah. Good to hear from you. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah, you too. Thanks. Jim, are you saying IS&GS revenue will be up in 2017 or are you saying that it will at some point later in the year on a quarterly basis reach a positive growth rate? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: I think that what we are seeing right now is that it will reach a positive growth rate during the year. It is possible that it will \u2013 one scenario that we've got is that it will be up on a full-year basis. But right now, it is kind of \u2013 it's part of the range of scenarios, Noah. We're liking what we see. The one thing that I probably should note that I meant to mention during my response to Amit's question is that the more and more we see the benefits of the integration of these businesses, we have them operationally together today, it's going to be a little more difficult for us to calculate growth rate on the legacy IS&GS business because we are making choices on where to bid new work between legacy Leidos and legacy IS&GS based on capabilities, cost structure, competitive rate structure, etcetera. And so, we can give you some flavor on that in the short run, but it's going to be a little bit cloudier later in the year and certainly into next year. And as a reminder, we're going to come up with a new segmentation in our Q1 call that we'll be describing during that call and that will actually be a segment structure that's based on how we are running the business starting this year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ian Zaffino with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Mark Zhang - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, good morning guys, this is Mark Zhang on for Ian. Thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to I guess like quickly see if there is any additional insights that you can provide now on NSS's domestic operation side going to 2017 given that international is very strong. I was just wondering like if there was any signs of a rebound or turnaround on the domestic side. Thank you. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: I think that on the domestic side, Mark, we don't view it as being a situation where it's turning around. And in fact we are seeing consistent strength in the bid pipeline, the win rate that is consistent with kind of how the budget and outlays are looking out of our customer set. So we are viewing that as being a business that will grow at or hopefully with a more competitive cost structure going beyond 2017 better than the budget growth rate. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Tobey Summer with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. Kwan Hong Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi, this is Kwan Kim on for Tobey. Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk about prospects for new projects in the public healthcare business under the new administration, particularly in the VA's effort in trying to modernize their system? Thank you. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, once again, we are kind of waiting and seeing. We are thrilled that Shulkin was unanimously approved as the VA administrator, which \u2013 and I didn't check any records, but it may be unprecedented that someone has been unanimously approved. And we obviously knew him from before all the way back to DHA. And he walks into the VA with clearly some mandates and some things he has to get done. How VA provides healthcare is \u2013 by the way, they provide some of the best healthcare in the world. And they work on an old HER/EMR system called AltaVista which runs on an old database system called MUMPS. And I think the issues at VA are not uniquely around the EMR/EHR but really have to do with their IT backbone writ large, which includes scheduling and it includes a sort of an ERP view, electronic health records is part of that. And Shulkin did mention \u2013 we have a program that came over as part as IS&GS which has to do with scheduling in the VA and Shulkin did address that in his confirmation hearing, that he was going to put some energy behind that program. And we have seen a small task order get funded really just since the beginning of the year. But it's small numbers. Let me speak in a bigger generality. I think that we will see emphasis in VA, that the government will spend more money to take care of our veterans, as I think we all believe they should. I think Shulkin will try to drive efficiencies into the VA system and that probably is good for us and good for other contractors like us that have a strong services support position to the agency. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brian Ruttenbur with Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ruttenbur - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Yes. Thank you very much for taking my call. A couple quick ones. D&A on the year that's included in your guidance, what is that level? And that's just an easy housekeeping if you can give me that. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Let's see, depreciation for the full year I believe is going to be about $45 million. Brian Ruttenbur - Drexel Hamilton LLC : And amortization? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, and then the amortization relative to the deal for the full year about $272 million. Brian Ruttenbur - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay. And then percentage of your contracts up for re-compete in 2017 as a combined company now. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: About 20%. Brian Ruttenbur - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay. Is that abnormally high or is that a normal number? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: That's about a normal number. And it makes sense when you think about our average contract length being roughly five years. Brian Ruttenbur - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay. And then the goal for debt, your leverage ratio is 3.5% now, by year end you are wanting to get it to, fill in the blank. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: We are looking at something close to 3 \u2013 about 3.0%. And as we said before, we're really pleased with the velocity that we're delevering. We weren't planning on making the level of debt pay down in the back end of 2016 that we did. And that's partly because we are able to squeeze some more cash out of the balance sheet, but also because the business is performing really well. And with the restructuring of the debt, as I mentioned earlier, it gives us an opportunity to reevaluate ways to reduce our cost of capital. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Rick Eskelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. The question is, Jim, you have mentioned it a couple times about improved win rates in stuff that you're bidding for. I'm wondering if you could give a little more detail on what you are expecting, maybe if there is anything initially that you've seen, early success signs, where do you think win rates can go with the combined company? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. We don't talk in detail about win rates because it's really hard for you to glean anything meaningful out of them as a single data point. What I will tell you though is that just in the backend of the year we've seen some very positive signs in win rates for new work, which has historically been some of the toughest places to have win rates that are up in the 30% to 40% range. The other thing is takeaways. One of the things that we're looking at increasingly are opportunities to take work away from our competitors that wouldn't be possible without the improvement that we've got to our cost structure and our bid structure. So, the improvement that we've seen just in 2016, the backend of 2016 on the win rate on takeaways has been very encouraging. And so, as we start to see those through the $28 billion that we've got in evaluation today, as well as the things that we're going to be submitting, we're feeling pretty good about it. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question. Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, thanks for taking the follow-up. On the cash deployment discussion you had during your prepared remarks, is there any order to those cash deploying priorities we should be thinking about, under what circumstance might you return to repo or M&A and how do you weigh those two against each other? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, I think that in the past we've talked about them as though there is an order and that was very deliberate. I think that now that we've got our debt down to a blended rate of about 4% and we're making very strong progress toward getting down to 3.0%, there is certainly some opportunity for us to set our sights on any other accretive transactions that would be either M&A or stock buyback at the right time. And so, we're already starting to map out a strategy that could involve any of those. And for the right thing we would not be completely closed to doing something material before we're down at a 3.0% level. It just depends on what it is and where that opportunity is on the accretion horizon. Operator : Thank you. Our final question this morning is from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Jim, when you were discussing earlier DHMSM and UK MoD as having been growth drivers last year and as a result coming up against some tougher year-over-year comparisons, were you saying you expect those programs to decline year-over-year in 2017? I couldn't quite tell if that is where you were going with that. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: No, just to be clear, those are flattening out. Those had been a big \u2013 they had been great growth drivers. We're looking for those to flatten, as I said, and then for the growth to be coming from the existing \u2013 or the pipeline of opportunities that I just spoke about. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yes, I think the point there was a year ago we \u2013 on a quarter-to-quarter basis, now we're looking a year back where we had a full quarter of those programs. And so year-over-year we're not seeing the growth that we would have seen a year ago under those two programs, but they're both still very strong programs and doing quite well. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: And don't forget that \u2013 remember, we do have the heavy construction business that we divested in 2016 that contributed roughly $100 million worth of revenue. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Which will be out of 2017. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Which will be out of 2017. Operator : Thank you. At this time I will turn the floor back to Kelly Hernandez for closing remarks. Kelly P. Hernandez - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Rob, and thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. We look forward to sharing more updates with you on our Q1 call. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kelly Hernandez, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Hernandez. Kelly P. Hernandez - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; and Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the Leidos management team. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter ending March 31, 2017. Roger Krone will lead off the call with comments on the market environment and our company strategy. Jim will follow with a discussion of our financial performance and our expectations for the future. After these remarks from Roger and Jim, we'll open the call for your questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, during the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in the press release that we issued this morning, and is also available in the presentation slides. The press release and presentation, as well as the supplementary financial information file are provided on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.leidos.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Kelly, and thank you all for joining us this morning for our first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. As the first full year of operations of the new Leidos post acquisition of IS&GS, this is a critical year in the company's journey to deliver competitively priced innovative solutions to a broader set of customers and to deliver value to our shareholders. That being said, I'm really pleased with how the year has started off. Our first quarter performance exceeded our expectations on revenue, margins, and earnings per share. During the quarter, we achieved the highest level of adjusted EBITDA margins for the company since our 2013 split and successfully turned IS&GS to growth. The diverse mix of our business, the focus on execution of both customer programs and the cost reduction initiatives enabled us to start the year with strong financial results and remain very confident in our full year guidance. As Jim will detail for you later, during the quarter we also restructured our business segments along our end markets. And our new reportable segments are as follows. The first is Defense Solutions, which represents about half of our business. This includes our Defense & Intelligence Group led by Tim Reardon and our Advanced Solutions Group led by Mike Chagnon. Next is Civil led by Angie Heise which represents about a third of our business. Third, our Health segment, continue to be led by John Scholl, represents the remainder of our business. And finally, we continue to report corporate expenses under the Corporate segment. The design of this segment structure is a reflection of our corporate culture focused always on our customers. Throughout the acquisition and integration process, we've been very careful to avoid disrupting any of the strong working relationships that our employees have fostered with our customers. We have in fact augmented the breadth and depth of resources available to our customer facing employees to enable them to grow their relationships, while arming them with a very competitive cost structure and capability set which they can offer. Our integration activities for the year are proceeding well and we're ahead of schedule to deliver on our previously stated synergy targets. Our general ledger consolidation which will drive a fair amount of our synergies is on track. We've also restructured the combined businesses into integrated segments as I've highlighted earlier and further streamlined our organizational structure. These efforts resulted in several changes to the executive leadership team including, Dr. John Fratamico, who is now Chief Technology Officer for the company. In this role, he oversees the offices of technology and engineering, which conduct research and development across all markets to unlock potential scientific discoveries or improvement in technologies for our customers. Previously, John served as the President of the Advanced Solutions Group, where he led our specialists in some of the most advanced technical work for our customers. Mike Chagnon joined the executive leadership team as President of the Advanced Solutions Group, leading a team of over 2,500 scientists and engineers in the design and development of mission critical technical solutions across all of our end markets. Throughout Mike's nearly 30 year career with Leidos, he has developed experience in systems and software engineering, specialized in the development and design of operational C4 enterprise systems for coalition, joint, strategic and tactical warfare of planning for CBRN/E effects assessment, decision support and mission planning. Sharon Watts now serves as our Chief Administration Officer, where she is responsible for managing the key central business functions and the optimization of indirect costs for the company and the integration and cost synergy achievement programs related to the IS&GS transaction. Prior to this role, she served as Deputy President of the Defense and Intelligence Group at Leidos and previously as Vice President of Engineering and Technology for the IS&GS business at Lockheed Martin, where she led 16,000 professionals to provide a focused, strategic vision to the technical community on new business challenges, internal research and development, and growth initiatives. Our executive leadership team's depth of experience in the industry and diversity of background coming recently from both Leidos and IS&GS truly represents the world-class employees we had at Leidos, and I am confident will drive positive impacts for our employees and our customers. As a testament to our team, our capabilities in our cost structure, we had several notable wins in the quarter \u2013 in cryptology for the Air Force, in cyber services for the Department of Homeland Security, and with the T4 Next Gen IDIQ for the VA. But probably most foretelling in the quarter was the large number of additional IDIQ vehicles we were awarded, which augment our large IDIQ portfolio even further. We were awarded positions on 38 additional IDIQ vehicles in the quarter, with just the top five of those representing over $1.1 billion in expected revenue to Leidos. These wins expand our ability to address the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, the Department of Homeland Security, the Defense Logistics Agency, among many others across our three end markets. As is our practice, we do not book IDIQ wins into backlog until task orders are issued against them. As such, these important wins were not reflected in our book-to-bill number, which for the quarter was 0.7, reflecting net bookings of $1.7 billion. While Q1 for us is a seasonally soft quarter for bookings, we were disappointed with several losses in the quarter, and we have initiated a thorough review of these bids. Additionally, we have seen more slowness than we expected in the acquisition organizations of our customers, due in part to the slow pace of executive leader appointments and budget uncertainty. This has had two primary impacts, in our view. First is a delay in the procurement process. Award decisions and procurement deadlines have been slipping to the right. Second, as a result of this, in many cases, the incumbent work related to those awards has been extended. The combination of these has resulted in extensions to our current work, and these are generally shorter in duration and lower in magnitude than new awards, and have decreased backlog from what we expected. Our industry-leading scale, cost structure, talented people, and innovative capabilities are competitive differentiators, and by optimally leveraging these, we were able to win more work and drive up our growth rate. We remain committed to solving our customers' most challenging problems, and continue to target a book-to-bill north of 1 for the full year. From a macro perspective, we're glad that Congress passed the full appropriations bills for both defense and domestic budgets for fiscal 2017. Despite coming seven months into the fiscal year, we are optimistic that the passage of these bills should enable an increased level of decision making from the acquisition organizations. The agreement includes an increase in defense and OCO budgets and avoids the deep cuts that were proposed to domestic spending. This backdrop bodes well for the market areas we are most exposed to and also bodes well, in our view, for what we can expect in fiscal 2018. We expect that government in fiscal 2018 will start under a continuing resolution, meaning that Defense Base and OCO will start fiscal 2018 at the fiscal 2017 rate, because we're coming off a full set of appropriations bills. Additionally, as a result of the increased operational tempo in some of the world's hot spots, we have seen a slight pickup, in our in-theatre programs. Although not material, yet at a consolidated level, the trend appears to be sustainable in the near term. The increased OCO levels agreed to by Congress also give us confidence in the sustainability of some of these recent pickups. In closing, I'm encouraged by our strong financial performance in the first quarter, the ongoing successful implementation of our synergy and integration plan, and the possible tailwinds from the policy actions of the new administration. I am confident that we have the right team to capitalize on the opportunities in the market and the right capabilities to enable our customers to solve their most challenging problems. My team and I remain committed to focusing on growth, profitability and cash generation to deliver value to our customers and employees, and return capital to our shareholders. With that, let me hand the call over to Jim Reagan, Leidos' Chief Financial Officer, for more details on the quarter and our outlook. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Roger, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We're off to a good start for the year, and as Roger previewed, we believe that we're on track to deliver to the guidance we provided in our last call. Consolidated revenues for the first quarter were $2.6 billion, nearly double the prior year's level, reflecting the acquisition of IS&GS. On a constant currency basis, revenues were roughly flat organically when adjusting for the acquisition of IS&GS and the divestiture of our heavy construction business. Also notable in the business is that after a long period of revenue declines within IS&GS, we were able to inflect to growth in the quarter, with revenues from legacy IS&GS up 1% on a year-over-year basis. We are pleased with this turnaround, and we believe that this reaffirms our thesis that with the acquisition, a lower cost structure, and more services aligned corporate structure would have positive impacts in the business. The strength in all of our businesses this quarter helped us achieve our highest level of adjusted EBITDA margin since our split in 2013 at 10%, up 210 basis points from the prior year's level. Achieving our full year target early in the year is a great accomplishment, and reflects successful cost reduction actions, as well as strong program performance across all of our businesses, Civil, Health and Defense Solutions. I'll discuss these more in a moment. Non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.88 per share on a basis of 153 million shares outstanding in the first quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share primarily excludes the impact of $69 million of acquired intangibles amortization and $32 million of restructuring expenses and acquisition and integration costs. Operating cash flow during the quarter was lower than normal at a use of $88 million. Two key factors drove our operating cash flow results in the quarter. First, Q1 has historically been seasonally softest due to onetime payments for employee bonuses and retirement contributions which impact the quarter. Second, as we have previewed with you since we closed the transaction, the first half of the 2017 has always been planned to be a peak of contract novation activity during which we expect the temporary increase in our DSO levels as we work with customers to transition billing and payment processes to reflect the acquisition. We ended the quarter at 65-day sales outstanding, a 4-day increase year-over-year as a result of this activity. We continue to expect an elevated level on the second quarter as well, but do expect a decline in DSOs in the second half of the year. We exited the quarter with a cash balance of $206 million after making another $20 million of debt repayments in the quarter. As we said last quarter, we remain committed to our capital deployment philosophy, which balances a number of options to include investing for growth in the business, regular quarterly dividends, debt pay down, and share repurchases. Our balanced approach provides us with the flexibility to take advantage of market conditions to lower our cost of capital, while also driving increased value for our shareholders and an improved competitive position for the company long-term. Let me turn now to our sector results for the first quarter. As Roger mentioned, we did restructure our reporting segments during the first quarter and we have provided a full year's worth of a historical results and pro forma results along the segment lines for you and the supplementary financials on our website. First, in our Defense Solutions segment revenues of $1.3 billion grew 66% year-over-year, reflecting the acquisition of IS&GS. On an organic basis, revenues declined by 1.4% from the prior year as growth in our airborne programs was offset by reduced volume and the completion of certain other contracts. Non-GAAP operating income for the segment of $95 million reflects a 7.3% margin. Operating performance in the quarter was strong, but impacted by reserve taken on one program which has required some course correction. We are near closer on the issues here and we expect to return to a more normalized operating level in Q2. As Roger mentioned briefly, the macro environment has had an impact in this segment in particular where longer-term award decisions are being delayed and replaced in many cases with shorter-term extensions. We do expect an improvement in the procurement climate when we have further budget clarity and executive appointments. In our Civil sector revenues grew more than 133% year-over-year, reflecting the IS&GS acquisition. Excluding the contribution of the IS&GS acquisition in the quarter and the heavy construction business in the prior year period, which has since been divested, revenues declined 7% organically. Now roughly half of this decline was driven by currency fluctuations and the exchange rate between the U.K. pound sterling and the U.S. dollar. The balance was driven by declines in our commercial energy services business. There are a lot of moving parts here, but we're mainly encouraged by the success we're having in our Civil business most evident in our significant improvement in operating margin both sequentially and year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income of $88 million grew sequentially despite the decline in the top line. Non-GAAP operating margin of 10.5% is the high watermark in this business even when considering pro forma historicals. As the segment with the highest level of fixed price work, this strong margin level is a reflection of the value of our ongoing cost reduction program with some added benefit in the quarter from some timing items that came in earlier than anticipated. Civil remains the area of our business where we get the most questions from investors regarding the impact of the proposed budgets and the administration's stated priorities. We have conducted a thorough analysis of this business, both the legacy Leidos business and the IS&GS business, and we've determined that the policy positions indicated thus far should have a minimal impact given the areas in which we have exposure to civil budgets. The expected impact from any potential cuts to budgets at the State Department, the EPA, the Coast Guard, FEMA, and the Commerce Department are immaterial. In fact, the appropriations bills agreed to last week did not include the $18 billion in proposed cuts for domestic spending which the administration had initially proposed, keeping the top level budgets flat for civil. Onto our health sector. The Health sector performed very well in the quarter delivering both double-digit organic revenue growth and considerable margin expansion. Revenues for the sector came in at $443 million in the quarter, with non-GAAP operating income of $66 million, representing a 14.9% margin. Revenue growth of a 159% year-over-year was driven by the acquisition of IS&GS, as well as organic growth of 11% due to the expansion in our Federal Health business. Non-GAAP margins grew 550 basis points from the prior year's level. Even on a sequential basis, despite flat revenues non-GAAP margins grew 410 basis points. The drivers of this were really strong program performance across the board in the segment, as well as a favorable mix of programs and some timing items that benefited us in the quarter versus expectations of contribution later in the year. While we would be cautious to expect this level of margin for the balance of the year due to the timing items I mentioned earlier, this margin expansion continues to validate our thesis that when run optimally with a strong focus on program execution, our Health business can provide a margin uplift to the broader organization. In our Corporate sector, we realized net expenses of $39 million during the quarter. This includes approximately $19 million of acquisition and integration costs, and $13 million of restructuring expenses associated with the transaction, both of which are excluded from our non-GAAP results as stated earlier. Excluding these transaction related expenses, which we expect to incur for some time, Corporate sector expenses were within the typical quarterly range. And now moving on to guidance. For 2017 revenue, we're reaffirming our prior guidance range for all metrics. Clearly with our performance in the first quarter, we are very confident in the range, but recognize that it is still early in the year and there are numerous uncertainties ahead which we must continue to successfully navigate. Our expectations remain as follows. Revenue $10.0 billion to $10.4 billion, adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.5% to 10%, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $3.05 to $3.35. In conclusion, we are pleased with our performance thus far in the year. We continue to optimize all aspects of the Leidos platform, including people, capabilities and cost in order to enable our employees to focus on addressing the needs of our customers and growing our business. With that, operator, let's open it up now so that we can take some questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Roger, I understand that in the slow award environment you can't really control. But more on the unexpected losses, can you characterize what end markets those were, what's the postmortem, what are you doing to address and where and when you expect those losses to manifest, for instance, should we think about that driving us to the lower half of the sales guide for instance? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, okay, Jon. Thanks for the question. At the time we closed the deal, there were about 150 bids outstanding between the two heritage companies. And they were bidding the heritage company's cost structure and with separate technical solution. So, as we have moved into this new year, those awards are finally working their way through the acquisition process. And although we are actually quite pleased with how most of the proposals have done, there is a small number, count them on less \u2013 on one hand, that we were enthusiastic about winning and we didn't. And I would say they were broken into half of those were the nature of our technical offering and half of those were where we were from a cost stand point. And realize this was a technical offering put together by the separate companies, so we didn't have the advantage of pulling our technical resources, and they were bid in the heritage cost structure. And we've actually updated our rates twice since we put these proposals in, once on day one, and now we just updated our rates again here in 2017. That being said, no one ever likes to lose, and so we do as we always do, we call it (24:55) and we do an after-action review. We go back and look at our competitive posturing, where we were in the pricing range versus where the awardee was, we take that, we go back, look at our cost structure to make sure that we are doing all the right things to continue to be competitive in the marketplace. In total, none of these were I would say material or significant, they are in \u2013 one is in the double digit millions, one \u2013 couple are in the three digit millions. But in the scheme of our business development pipeline, like I said, at any given time we have 150 bids to 200 bids outstanding. We don't see it as material. And again, we've reaffirmed our revenue guidance for the year and we think we're going to be just fine. Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And just to clarify the double-digit and triple digit millions, that's not an annual run rate, that's over time? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: That would be a face contract value. Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah, indeed. All right. Thanks for thoroughness. I'll get back in the queue. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: All right. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ed Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Could you \u2013 you mentioned a few times about pulling forward some performance. Could you sort of frame that for us, sort of how much was brought forward out of future quarters, and how much was just upside? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Ed, we're \u2013 I wouldn't characterize that as a number of contracts, particularly as we saw rack up in the health business. And when you think of these kind of pull forwards, typically there are EAC adjustments, and these are the kinds of things that are \u2013 I would call them ordinary course of business, they just were more phasing \u2013 time phasing items rather than things that we would say give us a reason to think that the margin that we have in \u2013 I am thinking of this, the health business is sustainable, so at the 14.9% rate. So we're pleased that those what we call pull forward items are there and again, they're more reflective of now that we're at a lower cost structure, we can update the longer term profit picture for a number of contracts and these were kind of updates to those EACs. So think of them as write-offs. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Other quick question, tax rate a little a little lower than we thought, is this the new accounting standard kicking in? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: About half of it is the new accounting standard, Ed, and then the other half of it are permanent differences that we were able to pull in. There was a little bit of R&D tax credit there, but generally it's about \u2013 half of it is new accounting standard and half of it is real cash differences. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your questions. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you very much. To maybe follow up on Jon's question. Roger, what was the annual run rate of the disappointing losses and what was the annual run rate, your expected annual run rate approximately of the 38 new IDIQ wins and did you have any bids that you won, but were protested and hence didn't make it into backlog? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Great question, Cai. Of course you know we don't do that. So, relative to the run rate, I will tell you that two of the four bids were takeaways from other contractors where business was re-competed and we felt we were competitive enough \u2013 we're competitive enough to take the business away. I will tell you on the protest, sort of the business as usual today is there are always protests and there were some awards in the period that were protested. Frankly there were some that we protested and there were some where the protest expired and we were eventually awarded the contract. And I think with all defense contractors and government contractors, we just see that as a fact of life today. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: And then to the question on the 38 IDIQs, what's your expected run rate? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: I'm not sure we have actually put it in that frame. We talked about $1 billion, plus a $1 billion task order generated from those, I mean that is typically is a couple of years \u2013 couple of hundred million dollars per year, maybe little bit higher than that. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. And then, Jim, you had a low tax rate in the quarter, did you adjust your tax rate for the year and if so, how come the earnings numbers didn't go up? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: We haven't yet adjusted our expected tax rate for the year. We're \u2013 if we're going to make an update to the guidance, say, in the second quarter or third quarter, we'd probably take a second look at how we treat that in our guidance picture. When we see the tax rate coming down a couple of points, it gave us about a $0.015 of tailwind on the EPS number which in the context of $0.88 non-GAAP, we didn't think it was that huge at this point. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And then last one. In the Defense Solutions, you mentioned the charge on the fixed-price contract. Just for context, roughly how large was that charge? And is that totally behind us? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Right now we think that the charge was certainly an adequate charge to take account for some increased costs that we had to make sure that we execute right for the customer involved. And so we're confident that it was more than adequate. I would characterize it as a charge that's in the mid-teens in terms of millions of dollars. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tobey Sommer with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Given generally better margin performance since the IS&GS acquisition and the expected, I guess, DSO relief in the back half of this year, do you look at the back half of this year as having increased financial flexibility with your debt level to start looking at repurchase and acquisitions a little bit more seriously? Thank you. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Tobey, I think we've actually confirmed that view from the very beginning. And the performance that we have to date I think is going to allow us to do that. And so of course there's always uncertainty, we're trying to figure out what's going in the government and it's early for us, but we always talked about looking at the back half and the cash generation and our capital allocation, capital deployment philosophy in finding the most efficient way to get that money back to our shareholders. Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And the last follow-up from me is, how understaffed are the \u2013 your agency customers at this point, at the undersecretary kind of (33:06)? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: I won't go agency by agency, but let's take the Department of Defense. So the Department of Defense has one confirmed person, and that would be the Secretary of Defense. There are now identified candidates for some of the service secretaries and the Deputy Secretary of Defense, but now with healthcare sort of being the topic of the day, it's not clear when those will even get before the Senate. And we find other agencies in a similar position. I'm not sure this is a precise number, but it's a number \u2013 over 500 confirmable administration appointments that have not been confirmed yet. So it's significant. I was with another customer \u2013 I was with the NASA customer and of course they don't even have yet an identified NASA administrator. And so the civil servants, these are really great individuals, are doing the best they can to operate the government with the authorities that they have. Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for the help. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning, everyone. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hey, good morning. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Noah. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Can you remind us what percentage of revenue comes from OCO, roughly? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I think in the past, I mean a couple years ago, it was in the $200 million range. Now it's coming off that a little bit. The thing that's always kind of the wildcard in that number, Noah, is that in the past two years the DoD has exercised perhaps more discretion on what comes out of the OCO budget than they have when that budgetary mechanism was first established. So I think that we're going to see that change again in the coming year, now that there's kind of a new budgetary regime in place that has a different way of working around the sequester limits, so. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. When you were discussing Civil vis-\u00e0-vis the 2018 request that had DoD up a decent amount, but Civil sort of funding it. I couldn't tell if you were saying that you were not as concerned as you hear investors are because the recent versions of bills we're seeing don't actually have those cuts going forward, or if you were saying that even if those cuts actually did occur, you just feel like you can navigate them with your positioning? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, let me start out with an incident \u2013 Jim can add to it \u2013 is if we look at whether it be the 2017 appropriations bill or the 2018 skinny budget against the civil agencies where we have a significant proportion of our revenue and then the departments of those agencies like Department of Transportation, where we have a lot of FAA work, we don't see even in the skinny budget significant cuts to the agencies that are our primary customers or the departments in those agencies that are our primary customers. And in fact, in some of our business like DHS, we see administration emphasis and priority, and increased spending. And so that give us reasonable confidence \u2013 again, we don't have a 2018 budget \u2013 that we can maintain our top line in that sector. Jim, any \u2013 ? Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Just in the world where there were going to be big cuts to certain agencies under the original, what they call the skinny budget, even then we didn't see material exposure. Now that the skinny budget isn't skinny, we see even a more, I'd call more immaterial. As Roger indicated, the places where we're strong in Civil are places that are aligned to the administration's priorities, be it infrastructure work, working with the FAA, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Social Security Administration, et cetera. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's interesting. And then just one more, just IS&GS being up 1% organically in the quarter. It sounds like that was earlier than what you were thinking, even just last earnings call. Was there something pulled forward, or do you think that's actually sustainably in the black through the rest of the year? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: There was some element of pull forward, but I think that what we were really thinking was that we weren't going to see a return to year-over-year growth until the middle of this year. So, it was a couple quarters earlier and that's encouraging. I think the other thing that we like seeing, not just in the IS&GS part of the business but in the legacy Leidos part of the business, is stronger margins. And clearly, the thing that we're seeing now is stronger margins, strong program performance, because of the cost reduction actions that we've taken which you're going to see that more immediately in margins and fairly soon. We expect to see it in win rates and more backlog building, because we're certainly able to bid on more competitive footing. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Terrific. Thank you. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Noah. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Krishna Sinha with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your questions. Krishna Sinha - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Just honing in on the Defense segment. Obviously you had a program specific or some program specific problems there. Can you just describe to us whether the bid environment has changed in Defense where maybe there is you're seeing margin compression across the board, because you're not the only one that have talked about defense margins being down. And it seems like everybody has got company specific reason. But I'm wondering if there is a broader trend here where you're seeing increased competition in that space. So can you just talk about that? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, what I would say, Krishna, is there is absolutely, I mean everyone in our business has to think of the environment remaining very cost conscious and cost competitive. With that said, we're pleased that aside from the one program where we did have to take a charge in the quarter, the business is running really well with strong margins and strong performance in the business. So, I think that \u2013 if you rewind a few years, when there was a wave of really competitive pricing pressure that started or intensified, I would say, our industry I think responded across the board with being very, very cost conscious and cost aggressive. And I think that \u2013 the scale of our business now that we've \u2013 we're incorporating and integrating the IS&GS business, it affords us the ability to be as competitive as anybody from a cost standpoint, and at the same time, remain anchored around our target margin percentages. Krishna Sinha - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then on \u2013 IS&GS was up 1% organically, but it looks like Defense was down organically, Civil was down organically. I understand part of that was from currency and some other things. But you said commercial energy services was down. Can you just give us the moving parts on what drove that IS&GS coming up and what does that imply about the core Leidos business, so the pre-IS&GS business? Can you just talk about what you're seeing on that side of the business as opposed to IS&GS, which is up? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. There were a lot of embedded questions. I'm going try to zero in on what I think you are focusing on and that is the \u2013 if IS&GS is up a point, what's going on in the legacy Leidos business. And what I would tell you, it's kind of a tough compare in Q1 because a year ago we had strong growth in the Leidos business, primarily on the backs of the U.K. program which was ramping up substantially, as well as the DHMSM, the defense health agency program that was ramping up then. Part of that ramp-up a year ago was in a construction portion of the U.K. program that is now completed. And so there is a dampening effect on the legacy Leidos growth from that, and then there is also where we have a big development push that we were under a year ago in DHMSM that we're not undergoing right now. And right now we are in the testing phase on DHMSM and next year we'll see another big ramp up on that program as we begin the broad rollout across the Defense Health facilities. Krishna Sinha - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then, just one quick one on cash. You talked about elevated DSOs in the first half. But how are you guys trending on your cash restructuring expenses year-to-date and do you see anything unexpected that's coming up here or nothing, something that might not be in the plan that you took charges on or is everything trending kind of exactly how you thought it was going to? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Right now, everything is trending exactly where we were expecting and the \u2013 as I think we alluded in the call, we're actually ahead of our expected realization of cost reductions. We're pleased with how that's going. And normally, when I see better cost takeout than we had planned, I would've expected more restructuring and severance type expenses, which we haven't been seeing. So, so far the return on the restructuring expenses, I'm feeling, is a little higher than we expected. Krishna Sinha - Vertical Research Partners LLC : That's great. Thank you. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Okay. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Ruttenbur with Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ruttenbur - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Yes. A couple of quick housekeeping. First of all on your guidance in 2017, I didn't catch it. Did you anticipate then a government fiscal 2018 budget to be passed on time, or are you assuming a CR? What is in that guidance? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, we assume a CR probably at least for calendar year 2017. So as you know there's a quarter mismatch between the government fiscal year and our year. But despite the President's comments, and we're hopeful that he's right, but history has taught us to expect a CR. Brian Ruttenbur - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay. And then just two other little follow-ups. Integration, are you 50% integrated in your opinion on IS&GS, and that integration will be complete by the end of calendar 2017? Or when do you consider it done and put a tombstone in it? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, it's a great comment. We're engineers and program managers; we actually have a metric. And we actually hit a 50% internal metric on 1 July, just so you know. But we really accelerate the back end of integration, and we expect to be in the 90% done by the end of first quarter of 2018. So \u2013 and that program has really gone well. And now Sharon Watts, our new CAO, has commanded that. And again we've been pleased at how smoothly the integration has gone. Brian Ruttenbur - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay. And then final housekeeping, which is just tax rate levels, 31.5% in the first quarter. I know there are some one-time items in there. Is that what we should be looking for going forward, that level? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. What we had said previously that the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis would be around 37%, and the thing that will drop that a little bit and that has dropped it a little bit is primarily the impact of the new accounting standard for taxes. And so as our stock price goes up, it gives us a book tax deduction, if you will, that puts downward pressure on the rate. So given where the stock price is today, if it continues in that trend, you're going to continue to see some downward pressure on the rate. But right now we're not quite ready to give you an updated full year tax rate, again for the full year. Brian Ruttenbur - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Sure, Jon. Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Roger, you commented that 1Q beat your expectations on a number of fronts. Is it just a lack of budget certainty that's keeping you from increasing guidance, or should we think about this as more of a philosophical approach where you kind of want to wait until July or even October before adjusting your outlook? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, and Jon, we've been doing this a long time, and we just \u2013 if you think about it, we put out guidance with our year-end close, and here we are in first quarter. And philosophically we like to see more performance. If there was a big non-recurring that moved the numbers up, we would just pass that off in guidance, but typically we want to see a little bit more demonstrated performance, a little bit more run rate. But of course, as both Jim and I said, we're really pleased with the numbers that we've seen, and frankly a little bit ahead on some of the cost reductions and the restructuring, and revenue has held up well. Although I mentioned the competitive environment and some disappointments, we've also had great growth in our existing contracts, and our team has been able to expand some of our statement of work with some of the administration's priorities that can be covered by current contracts. So, again, we feel really good about the year. But it's the first quarter. And for us, without something really compelling, we want to get more demonstrated performance, better understand the budget, what's going on inside the Beltway. Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then briefly, Jim, can you just remind us, versus your guidance of at least $475 million of operating cash flow this year, what's the assumed CapEx? And then also what is the \u2013 what is the full-year impact of that increased working capital cushion related to innovation? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Okay. So think of our expectation for CapEx at around $60 million, which would be \u2013 remember the $475 million is guidance for what is cash flow from operations on the cash flow statement. So you got about $60 million there out of that on CapEx, and then the way we have thought about- what we've said previously the way we think about working capital assumption is about a three day increase from the end of last year to the end of this year embedded in that number, three day increase in DSO. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Okay. Operator : Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, just actually a follow up to that. What's the approximate millions of dollars in cash from ops related to a day? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: I think it's $30 million a day. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: $30 million. And then, beyond the novation reversal and the change in cash restructuring, is there anything else below segment revenue and EBIT that is a material change 2018 versus 2017 cash flow? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: What we \u2013 we talked about CapEx is a little higher, obviously, because we're bigger that \u2013 that's $60 million that actually shows up in investing activities part of the cash flow statement, three days of DSO, and then we've also talked about the restructuring costs that show up in the P&L and their cash. So \u2013 and that will tail off early next year from a run rate basis. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And sorry, just a clarification on the CapEx comment. You're saying $60 million is higher because you're a larger- or your run rate something more than $60 million going forward? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, yeah. Before the acquisition of IS&GS we were running about $40 million a year. So, we're getting some great efficiency on a per revenue dollar basis with lower CapEx or a broader portfolio. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So something in the vicinity of $60 million is a good number to use for some period of time? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, that's right because \u2013 and the way we're getting that efficiency is much more effective real estate footprint. We're able to grow into some vacant space, as opposed to go out and procure new space and have resold improvements, et cetera on that. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And then one more, back to the order front. With everything you know, even recognizing that a decent amount of what you know is the degree of uncertainty in some ways, but I guess with everything you know, are you able to articulate a view on how orders trend as we move through the year or where book-to-bill shakes out for the year? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, no, I \u2013 in my prepared remarks we committed to book-to-bill greater than 1, which is where we've been for the full year. We've always been sort of a seasonal with the third quarter being our strongest with the appropriations bill, assuming it gets passed by the Senate today and signed by the President tonight, that will accelerate awards and I think we will see maybe even more seasonality into second and third quarter than we might have seen in prior years. And as we kind of plot through the bids outstanding, and think about what's happening in customer space, I think it confirms that we will see maybe a little bit more seasonality this year, which means probably our peek awards quarter will be third quarter. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Noah. Operator : Our last question today will be coming from the line \u2013 a follow-up from the line of Krishna Sinha with Vertical Research. Please go ahead with your question. Krishna Sinha - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi, guys. I just want to make sure I'm understanding this correctly. It sounds like -you guys have previously talked about a 3% revenue growth going forward, it sounds like a significant portion of that is driven by contracts that you already have booked, specifically some of your Health contracts. Can you talk about, maybe break it down in terms of how much of that 3% is going to be dependent on new awards that you book, so sort of the second half surge in bookings that you're expecting, and how much of that is just driven by what you already have that's embedded in your contracts? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Gosh! When we've talked about 3% growth, we've talked about that as being more in the 2018 and beyond as we begin to realize some revenue synergies that we talked about back in August. These were things that as two standalone businesses neither company would have event bothered bidding, but now we can because of cost structure competitiveness and a broader array of capabilities to bring to our customer set. So, already at the beginning of the any given year, and this year was no exception, we already had visibility in the 80% of our work which was in backlog or high probability of win extensions of contracts. So, you have a go-get. And right now with where we stand on contract growth as well as the awards we have today, that again gives us the kind of condolence that Roger and I talked about relative to our guidance. So, I mean I would think about if you're asking to get to the 3% is that going to be more realized in things that still have to awarded and the kind of revenue synergies we've talked about, I think the answer is yes. Krishna Sinha - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time I will turn the call back to Kelly Hernandez for closing remarks. Kelly P. Hernandez - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Rob, and thank you all for your interest in Leidos and for your time this morning. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Krishna Sinha - Vertical Research Partners LLC Brian Ruttenbur - Drexel Hamilton LLC Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Leidos Second Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kelly Hernandez, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Freeman. Kelly Freeman - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; and Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the Leidos management team. Today, we'll discuss our results for the quarter ending June 30th, 2017. Roger will lead off the call with comments on the market environment and our company strategy. Jim will follow with a discussion of our financial performance, and our expectations for the future. After these remarks from Roger and Jim, we'll open the call for your questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, during the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is provided in the press release that we issued this morning, and is also available in the presentation slides. The press release and presentation, as well as a supplementary financial information file are provided on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.leidos.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Kelly, and good morning. Kelly Freeman is the newest addition into our Investor Relations team, and brings 17 years of experience in the finance departments with Lockheed Martin and Leidos. We're pleased to have her here as our Director of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us this morning for our second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. We had a very strong second quarter, driven by solid operational execution across all of our businesses. I want to thank our team for their unwavering focus on delivering for our customers, and our shareholders. The results from the quarter and the year-to-date demonstrate our ability to extract even more value from the transaction than we had anticipated, and allow us to increase our 2017 guidance as well as our expectations of gross cost synergies from the transaction. As we approach the one-year mark since the closing of the IS&GS acquisition, I want to take a few minutes to reflect on all that we have achieved. We have fully incorporated 15,000 new employees into the company. We structured the combined businesses into integrated segments along our end markets, and continue to add depth and strength to our leadership team. We've been able to outperform to the targets provided at our August 1st, 2016 Investor Day. Specifically, we've increased our initial revenue guidance provided then by more than $200 million at the midpoint. And as I alluded to and Jim will detail further, we are again increasing our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share expectations for 2017 to a revised range of $3.45 to $3.60, more than $0.30 higher at the midpoint from our prior range, and nearly $0.50 higher than the initial expectations provided at our Analyst Day. In addition, after raising our initial gross synergy estimates, from $240 million in our January announcement to $350 million in our August Analyst Day, the focus and results we've seen to-date allow us to once again increase our view here to now more than $400 million of gross cost synergies. Jim will provide more details on the integration activities and revised expectations, shortly. Overall, the past year has been one of transformational change, and a lot of hard work by our employees. One notable effect of this transformation was our renewed inclusion in the FORTUNE 500 listing, after having been excluded from this list following the 2013 split. This is a testament to the successful execution of the transaction, and most importantly, an external recognition of the efforts of our employees; their commitment to customer and to a successful integration has enabled us to outperform expectations on many metrics and position us well for continued success and growth. Now, onto the quarter. Revenue for the quarter was $2.6 billion, a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came in well-above our expectations at $1.04. These strong results were driven by robust program performance, and the immediate impacts of cost reductions across our fixed price and T&M programs. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter of 10.9% exceeded both our full-year and long-term targets due to these factors. Also as expected, cash generation improved in the quarter, resulting in $177 million of cash flow from operations. We exited the quarter with $262 million of cash on hand, and a consistent philosophy on capital deployment. As we've said in the past, we consider a number of options for capital deployment to include investing for growth in the business, regular quarterly dividends, debt pay down, and share repurchases. Our balanced approach provides us with the flexibility to take advantage of market conditions to lower our cost of capital, while also driving increased value for our shareholders and an improved competitive position for the company long-term. Following a seasonally soft first quarter on awards, we saw a nice uptick in Q2. Net bookings of $2.7 billion in the quarter drove a book-to-bill of 1.0. We are pleased with the numbers here, although we continue to focus on driving improvements in our business development operations. We continue to focus on building a healthy, qualified pipeline, and increasing the win rates of submitted proposals through three primarily competitive differentiators. First, competitive pricing, which we have enabled through cost synergies. Second, innovative technical solutions, which we continue to strengthen through investment in both people and capabilities. And third, our deep customer relationships. A few notable program wins in the quarter possible through success in these three factors include a re-compete contract with the Veterans Benefits Administration supported by our Health Group. This contract allows us to continue our decades-long commitment to serving the nation's veterans with critical clinical support. This win was held up in a protest for nearly a year, and after recent resolution, contributed to our bookings in the quarter. Another win is a task order awarded by the U.S. Army to provide program management solutions to the Department of Defense Biometrics program. This win marks an example of a true revenue synergy as we're able to leverage legacy IS&GS' prime position on the DoD Automated Biometrics Identification System vehicle and our extensive combined qualifications in tactical biometrics collection, processing and solution development. Finally, in our Defense segment, we are awarded a third task order by the U.S. Army to lead the integration of Airborne Reconnaissance Low-Enhanced systems. The ARL-E program, as we call it, as we have noted before is a program of record supported by our Advanced Solutions Group enabling a multi-intelligent airborne platform that provides a persistent capability to detect and track targets with a high degree of timeliness and accuracy. From a macro perspective, we've seen a couple of notable improvements since last quarter. First, the May agreement on the fiscal 2017 budget provided clarity on spending levels through the end of September. And secondly, we saw a further progress in the resolution of key presidential appointments, including the confirmations this week of several important leadership positions at the Department of Defense. However, despite this progress, there's still high number of unfilled leadership appointments and the approaching government fiscal year-end continue to serve as headwinds, in our view, to a more normalized procurement and acquisition pace with our customers. Organizationally, during the quarter, we continued to strengthen our company leadership through the addition of Frank Kendall, Former Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics to our board of directors. Frank brings over 40 years of experience in national security affairs, acquisition, engineering, and the military, further improving our board's breadth and depth of experience. In addition, recently, after seven years of service to the company, leading a word-class legal team, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Vince Maffeo, has decided to retire. I want to thank Vince not only for his contributions and leadership in helping navigate the company through several pivotal milestones including the separation from SAIC, and the recent acquisition of IS&GS, but also for his guidance, advice and support over the past few years that I have been with the company. Replacing Vince will be Jerry Howe, who comes to us most recently from Fried Frank, where he served as partner. Jerry brings more than 30 years of leadership experience at global organizations in aerospace, defense, and intelligence. Jerry's demonstrated background representing clients in government contracts litigation, investigations, and bid protests, as well as M&A, will serve us well, and I am excited to welcome him to the team. In closing, I'm pleased with our strong financial performance in the second quarter and in the first half of the year. While there continue to be challenges ahead in this uncertain and competitive environment, I remain encouraged by the strength and determination of our employees. Their demonstrated abilities to focus not only on delivering innovative solutions to our customers, but also on successfully implementing integration activities critical to enabling an optimum cost structure gives me confidence in our ability to succeed, grow and create value for our shareholders. With that, let me hand the call over to Jim Reagan, Leidos' Chief Financial Officer, for more details on the quarter, and our full-year outlook. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Roger, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call, today. Our second quarter results reflect improved bookings and operational momentum across the board, and allow us to increase our expectations for the full year. Consolidated revenues for the second quarter were $2.6 billion, double the prior year's level. This reflects 6% organic growth in the IS&GS Business relative to pro forma historicals, offset by a comparable decline in the legacy Leidos business. GAAP operating income was $166 million during the quarter. Non-GAAP operating income in the quarter of $264 million excludes the impact of $98 million of adjustments, including most notably $67 million of acquired intangibles amortization and $22 million of restructuring expenses and acquisition and integration costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin, which is based on non-GAAP operating income, was above our expectations at 10.9%. This strong performance was the result of our disciplined focus on cost reduction actions, as well as strong program performance across all of our businesses. Margins in the quarter benefited from two notable items, which we don't expect to recur in future periods. First, due to delays in acquisition cycles and protests of awards, we benefited from extensions of key higher margin programs. As the final award decisions on these protested re-competes took longer than expected, our first half results benefited from a slower-than-expected ramp down of these programs. Now that these protests have been resolved, we expect to transition to a lower level of revenue and profit from these programs beginning in the third quarter. Second, we also benefited from an elevated level of program write-ups in the second quarter, reflecting outperformance in our cost reduction activities relative to our expectations. Non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.04 per share on a basis of 153 million shares outstanding in the quarter. These strong results were driven by the higher level of adjusted EBITDA margins, coupled with a lower tax rate. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter of 32% was below our previous estimate of 37% and drove an $0.08 benefit to earnings per share. The lower-than-expected tax rate was due to higher than forecasted tax benefit from equity compensation awards. Operating cash flow increased sequentially as expected, resulting in a generation of $177 million during the quarter. This was driven by an improvement in our billings and collections processes relative to last quarter as we continued to work through contract innovation-related items resulting from the IS&GS transaction. DSOs ended the quarter at 65 days, flat sequentially. We continue to expect DSO reduction from our Q2 levels with a year-end target of approximately 63 days. This estimate embeds a buffer for potential short-term disruption of cash billing and collection cycles driven by the timing of integration activities. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $262 million after making another $46 million of debt repayments in the third quarter. Before I move on to segment results, I'd like to provide some further detail on three key integration milestones. First, on July 1, we successfully transitioned the Human Resource and Payroll Management System used by a majority of the IS&GS employee base onto the Workday Solution used by legacy Leidos. Second, we streamlined all purchasing activity onto a consolidated procurement system, converting over 10,000 legacy IS&GS purchase orders in the process. Third, we began the process of migrating financial systems, completing the transfer of a portion of the IS&GS business over to a Leidos Costpoint Solution. This successful transition gives us confidence and experience as we look ahead to the single most important integration activity still ahead of us. And that's the consolidation of the remaining financial systems, which is slated for Q1 of 2018. The successful completion of these actions keeps us on our integration schedule, and has significantly reduced our dependencies on Lockheed Martin Transition Support. We anticipate realizing additional cost savings as we exit the Transition Services Agreement ahead of schedule in the third quarter. At the halfway point of the year, we've already achieved our full-year 2017 run rate targeted cost synergies. And we are now updating our gross cost synergies target to over $400 million of annually-recurring savings by 2019, up from our prior target of $350 million. In order to capture this additional $50 million of annualized cost synergies, we expect to incur additional costs, and that's in tandem with the higher cost synergies target, we are revising our integration cost expectation to roughly $275 million from our prior expectation of $235 million. We believe this additional expense generates a high return on investment, and we're confident in our ability to drive these additional savings just as we have delivered on the targets thus far. Let me turn now to our segment results for the second quarter. First, in our Defense Solutions segment, revenue for the quarter was $1.2 billion. Organically, revenue declined about 1% year-over-year, reflecting program completions, partially offset by increased volume in our airborne programs. Non-GAAP operating income for this segment was $109 million. This reflects an 8.8% margin for the quarter, a sequential improvement of over 150 basis points, representing a return to more normalized program performance in this segment. In our Civil segment, revenue for the quarter of $875 million, reflects organic decline in the legacy Leidos business compared to the prior year, and the integration of the IS&GS business revenues. The organic decline is due to the ramp-down of the LCST fulfillment center build-out recognized in the prior-year period, as well as scope reductions in some existing programs. Non-GAAP operating income of $96 million for the Civil segment grew sequentially. Non-GAAP operating margin of 11% set a new high watermark for this business relative to the pro forma historicals, reflecting strong program performance and a lower level of indirect cost as discussed earlier. Now, onto the Health segment. We had a second consecutive quarter of strong performance, which contributed to margin lift at the consolidated level. Strong revenue for this segment of $454 million was driven by program extensions and increased scope on some programs with our Federal Health customers offset by the timing of revenues in our commercial health practice. Non-GAAP operating income of $74 million in the quarter represents a 16.3% margin, up 740 basis points from the prior year's level. Notably, non-GAAP margins also grew 140 basis points, sequentially. The continued strong performance of our Health business relative to our prior expectation was driven by strong performance on contracts referenced earlier, which benefited from unanticipated extensions of work while protested re-compete award decisions were in process. Final award decisions were made in the second quarter, which combined with additional wins drove our outsized book-to-bill in this segment at 2.2x for the quarter. Now, that the protests have been resolved, we expect second half revenue run rate and profitability level for our Health business to be at a more normalized lower level as the extension work which buoyed first half results winds down. Onto our Corporate segment. We incurred net expenses of $37 million during the quarter. This includes approximately $16 million of acquisition and integration costs, and $6 million of restructuring expenses associated with the transaction, both of which are excluded from our non-GAAP results, as stated earlier. Excluding these transaction-related expenses, which we expect to incur for some time, Corporate segment expenses were within the typical quarterly range. Now, moving on to guidance. Our strong first half performance gives us more confidence in our expectations for the full year. And while there is the possibility of a government shutdown at the start of government fiscal year 2018, our guidance continues to embed an assumption that the year begins with a continuing resolution. Our updated guidance is as follows : revenue of $10.1 billion to $10.4 billion, tightening up our prior range of $10.0 billion to $10.4 billion. We now expect adjusted EBITDA margins of 9.8% to 10.2%, up from our prior range of 9.5% to 10%. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $3.45 to $3.60, up from the prior range of $3.05 to $3.35. Our guidance for cash flow from operations is unchanged at or above $475 million, reflecting the potential cash impact of planned system migrations which are scheduled to commence at the end of Q4. In addition, we now expect our full-year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 35% to 35.5% versus prior estimates of 37%. In conclusion, we are pleased with the momentum in our business, and we're encouraged by the opportunities ahead of us. We remain focused on achieving our targets and driving synergies across the combined business to create value for our shareholders. And with that, Rob, let's now open it up so that we can take some questions. Operator : Thank you. Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Sure. Good morning, Jon. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Can you talk a little bit about to what extent the higher synergy target goes to the bottom line? And then, I know you're not going to talk about 2018 at this point, but if you're exceeding your 10% EBITDA \u2013 if you're potentially exceeding your 10% EBITDA target this year, is there chance to do better in 2018, or should we be mindful of some of the programs that are running hot this year that won't necessarily repeat next? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Sure, Jon, and thanks for your question. So what we've previously said is that, approximately one-half of cost savings drops to the bottom line given that about half of our business relates to cost-type contracts. What we've also said is that, you can expect the piece that is not savings that is attributable back to the customer to go to enhanced margins, but also gives us the capability to reinvest in the business, whether it's in additional market development and business development activities or research and development type activities. So I think that, now we're seeing the possibility of EBITDA margins that are above the 10% that we've previously said. Our target was, and you are right, we're not yet ready to talk about what margins will look like in 2018. But certainly, the success of our integration and synergies gives us the capability to be more confident in margin increases, but also give us the possibility of going in and investing more in the things that drive future growth in our business. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then, in the quarter and year-to-date, we've seen a little bit of diverging performance between legacy Leidos and legacy IS&GS, especially on the sales side. How do you think about those two? I know, you're not going to guide specifically to those. But what's going on year-to-date? What has to happen in each of those items going forward as you look to achieve 3% organic growth in 2018 and beyond? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Well, yeah. First, Jon, I would tell you that, the growth in the IS&GS business we're really pleased with, and in fact, that part of the business has grown a bit faster and performed a bit better on the top line than we had originally modeled. With that said, the compare from last year on the legacy Leidos business, it's really a couple of things. One, as you might recall, we had a big build-out portion of the LCST program that gave us some unusually strong revenue in the Defense segment a year ago that did not recur this year. The margin on that revenue was very modest. I think, the second piece of it, you would think about as being some Defense programs that went down relative to last year. But remember that, when we talk about how we're growing the business, and how we're investing, we're thinking about this more \u2013 certainly on a more consolidated level. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then, just to pass the 3% next year. What has to happen through your judgment? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, the coming quarter for book-to-bill is always our seasonally best quarter, and achieving our own expectations on both the book-to-bill in Q3 and in Q4, as well as some of the revenue synergies that we've talked about at Analyst Day. I think that, one of the wins that we just saw in the past quarter is kind of emblematic of what we were expecting in terms of higher Pwin on certain efforts that combine both the depths of the technical capability of Leidos particularly in biometrics along with deeper customer relationships that the combined business gives us, that's how we got to thinking about a target of 3% for next year. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Jon. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Good morning. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hi, Noah. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Jim, when you say, Health back-half should have more normalized revenue and margin; can you quantify that? Because hear you on why the margin was a little hot in the quarter, but it's been pretty close to the level it was at in the quarter, three quarters in row now, and similarly on the revenue, it sort of been in the same place sequentially three or four quarters in a row? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. So as you know, Noah, we don't guide to margin \u2013 that is segment-specific results on revenue or margin. But what I would tell you is that, the performance on a handful of contracts that \u2013 while those contracts aren't going away, the revenue run rate on those is going to go down a bit, and the contract extensions are priced at a level that would imply that the margins are going to come down, although we're still looking at strong margins for that part of the business going forward. But just not \u2013 as we said during the prepared remarks, the 16.3% is not something that we expect to go into the second half. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Can you quantify, how much revenue you lose sequentially from those contracts? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Noah, that would kind of violate our policy of not guiding the segment-specific numbers for the year. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: So, I think we'll have to wave off on that one. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Fair enough. The LCST build-out, when do you annualize that, such that it's no longer a year-over-year headwind? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: That should be around the end of the year. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Next year. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So that's sort of a growth headwind 3Q, 4Q, and then ceases to be one as you start 2018? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: That's right. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just finally, how should we think about where 2018 cash flow from operations goes relative to 2017? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, we'll certainly see it stronger from a couple of things; one, the first one is we will not have the same level of integration costs that are currently embedded in the $475 million plus number what we've guided to currently. The second is that, our belief is that, by having the business or the bulk of the business, that is roughly 90% of it on a unitary financial system, we can see the same kind of billing acceleration and cash flow acceleration on the acquired business that we've been enjoying in the Leidos business. So, it is \u2013 faster billing means faster cash, and we believe that we'll be able to accelerate the velocity of billing on the acquired business. So those are the primary drivers of enhanced cash flow conversion for 2018. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company, LLC: Yes. Thank you very much. Good results, guys. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Cai. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company, LLC: So I think, on the first quarter call, you had mentioned that you've taken your rap rates down. I believe, you said twice as a result of kind of cost savings. Could you comment on what have you done with your rap rates on your bids here in the second quarter and maybe year-to-date? And what sort of impact are you seeing it having on your book-to-bill? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Let's see. Cai, as we look out, we'll probably have another update of the rates towards the end of the year. Those will also be favorable as we get our back-office systems aligned, and able to continue with synergies. And you know, in backlog, it has sort of a short-term and a long-term effect. In the short-term, on our cost-type contracts, it can reduce backlog. But we think in the long-term, we become more competitive, and we expect our win rate to increase. And over the long-term, it's part of the formula that we have to get to the 3% CAGR, overall. And of course, we also challenge our program managers when there's a windfall reduction on a contract with a specific customer to engage in dialogue with that customer on enhancements that we can provide and other value-added services to that contract to be able to get that, the program manager on the customer's side to enhance their mission or their program offering. And so, we try to challenge our team to go back and capture the cost savings and added scope that's associated with a reduction in cost. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company, LLC: Terrific. And then, I think, on your first quarter call, you indicate Q3 the strongest book-to-bill and the full-year above 1. Maybe, if you could update us on both of those, and comment on re-competes. I gather you guys were unsuccessful on the NASA Mission Systems Ops bid. Thanks. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Let's see, as Jim said, third quarter's always our strongest, and we do what everyone else does. We've got a pipeline, we've got things in flow. We then, through a large systematic process, put probability wins against what's in the pipeline. And we generate what our expectation is for third quarter, and that's what has led to confidence in an even stronger third quarter. There is a program at Johnson Space Center, the current contract is called FDOC. Cai, as you alluded to, the re-compete modified that contract a bit, and gave it a new name called MSOC, the Mission Systems Operations Center (sic) [Mission Systems Operations Contract]. There was an announcement of that, the winner of that program. Another company was announced as the winner. My recollection, I think, there were three bidders of which we were one, we were the incumbent. It is my understanding that that is now under protest. And as such, I can't comment much about it, because it's in that legal venue. I would only submit that, we've had that contract for a long time. By the way, that's to support the Operations Center for the International Space Station. It's a historic legacy IS&GS contract. It's one that we've had very, very high award fees, and have done a terrific job on. We just moved the Mission Operations Center to new technology. And I will say, as the protest evolves, we will see where that one goes, and where that may ultimately end up at this point is difficult to predict. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company, LLC: And lastly, maybe, you could give us some color on upcoming re-competes and maybe your bid pipeline by the three sectors? Bids outstanding? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Let's see, that's a tall order. Let me just say that our \u2013 we're happy with our pipeline. We don't see any re-competes that are significant or material. We're actually relatively happy with our win rate. As we have said at first quarter, I'll repeat again today, is some of the acquisitions still continue to be delayed. We run about a $23 billion pipeline. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: In evaluation. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, which is about where we want to be. And I don't see anything in our business development metrics or the pipeline or our win rate that causes me undue concern. In fact, obviously, I feel better today than I did at first quarter. It's still a very competitive environment. We've got to win business every day. We're still focusing on how we can do that better. And for us, that's to find a way to differentiate ourselves from everybody else in the industry. And we're doing that really through those three points that I made on the call, through cost, through technological innovation, and then frankly making sure that we stay close to the customer. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company, LLC: Thank you very much. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Cai. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Cai. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Rob. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hi, Rob. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: So I wanted to go back to the organic growth. You'd already talked about the fact that there's some tough comps in the legacy Leidos business, but you also, I think, mentioned that some of the strength at IS&GS was unexpected extension of work. Is that the case? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: That's clearly part of it, it's not all of it. And the unexpected extension really relates back to this acquisition environment that we have described, and I've heard other describe is that new contracts are slow. So existing contracts are being extended beyond what we would have anticipated when we put the plan together at the beginning of the year. We have been a beneficiary of the extensions, which has helped us, and always when they re-competed work, they do that to create competition, which can put pressure on margin. And so, we had existing business extended. It's usually with a favorable variance to the margin forecast that we would have predicted. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And it seems like with \u2013 given that you've tweaked up the lower end of the revenue guide, and we're halfway through the year here and well into the third quarter, you're pretty comfortable with your visibility on revenue here in the second half just given, again, some of these timing differences that seem to have surfaced? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Rob, I think, you've obviously nailed that one pretty well. Just probably, as you have a model, we have our model, and revenue for this year has got to be in a high-90s already in backlog. Because of the time constant in our industry, it's just \u2013 even if we win a program , say, in the third quarter, and we ramp up, and we start staffing, it doesn't have a big effect on revenue in the year. And so, what you've alluded to is clearly correct. We have high confidence in our revenue forecast for the rest of the year, because the majority \u2013 the overwhelming majority of that is already in backlog. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then, just digging a little bit deeper, you talked about a bunch of the awards at the beginning, Roger, some of the new business. Are there some good specific examples of revenue synergies coming through, programs that neither of you would have won alone? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, there are \u2013 some of the interesting things we find in our new business is being twice the size, there are very few that are big material revenue movers. And so, on any given day, the $1,500 millions are coming in all the time. There are some, and I was at an Analyst Conference a couple of months ago, and I talked about the NMCI, Navy Next Gen program, but that's probably 18 to 24 months out in the future as being probably a material contract that we can now bid on that we wouldn't have bid on before. What we're finding now is like, I talked about the Biometric program is, because we got IDIQ vehicles that we didn't have, we've got technology that we didn't have. We have a more robust pipeline. We're bidding on a broader set of programs for the broader set of customers. It's enhanced our position at places like FAA and CMS and Social Security and VA. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And then, I think, it's really very interesting that Frank Kendall has joined the board, and our experience with him, we always thought of him \u2013 and maybe this is incorrect, but he's a platform, program, hardware acquirer, if you will. Obviously, he was doing services as well. But does this position the company maybe to go after a little bit more of that core Defense hardware or platform work maybe move a little bit differently than in the past? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Wow, that's a \u2013 boy, that's an insight, I really hadn't given much thought to; let's see. We are thrilled that, Frank joined our board. Frank, as you know is, West Point grad, engineer, lawyer, has an MBA, has been in industry before he's been in government several times. Although, he's got a clearly intimate knowledge of platforms because the government buys a lot of platforms, but in his role in AT&L, he bought hundreds of billions of dollars of services as well. I'd just tell you that he is very, very thoughtful board member, and I think, Jim would add, we are quite pleased that he has fully upped the speed. He participates very actively in the discussions at the board level, and he brings insight just as our other board members do, here; John Jumper, who is Head of the Air Force, and others, and we're just thrilled to have him on the board. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, just last thing on the VA contract, I think, you might have talked about it earlier. This is a continuation of work that you've already done. It's a multiple-award IDIQ. So this is different than what people have been trying to understand about GENESIS, and the equivalent award to GENESIS at the VA. Is there anything you can update us on there? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, okay. Let me spend just a second, and if you will, try to unpack that a little bit. The VA award that I discussed in my statement is not related to electronic healthcare records. It is actually clinical work that we do around veterans and their health. And it is a program that came to us as part of IS&GS that they've had for some time that was in protest. That is actually divided by districts, that particular program, and you win and lose different districts. I think, they're up to six districts, and we won several of those districts, and others won other districts. And then there is some competition around performance in that program. I would simply say, it had been in protest for at least a year, maybe over a year; it's out of protest. We're off executing. It's a program that we love because we support veterans and veterans' health. I think in your question was a comment or a question really around electronic healthcare records the VistA replacement program... Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Correct. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: ...I don't have a lot to say there. I will tell you what the facts are as we all known them, that Secretary wrote what's called, Directions and Findings (sic) [Determination and Findings] which kicks-off an acquisition process to select the electronic healthcare records off the shelf commercial vendor that we are using as part of the Defense Health program. In his D&F, he said that the VA will use that electronic healthcare records system for the transformation of VistA. All right, that's really the only news that we can report on. I think, the Veterans Affairs has said that, we are in negotiation with that party around how that program will look, and that, that process will take several months. Clearly, Leidos has done installation of that healthcare records system for the Department of Health Affairs. We're in our second \u2013 we had our IOC site. We've done our second healthcare facility, we'll do two more this year. And clearly, Leidos believes we can add a lot of value to the VA program, and we are poised and prepared to assist the VA in any possible way we can. Operator : Thank you. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ed Caso with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. It's Rick Eskelsen on for Ed. Just wanted to follow-up to Cai's earlier question about bookings, kind of a two-pronged question. First, Roger, in your script, I think, you sounded a little bit more cautious on the award outlook than what we've heard elsewhere in the industry, maybe if you can talk a little bit more about that? Is it just related to the slowness in terms of staffing up Presidential appointees? And then building on, beyond the cost measures that you've taken, can you talk a little bit more about how you've sort of revamped and brought together the business development approaches of the two companies; and if there's been any areas, especially within the legacy, IS&GS piece that you've been surprised by? Thank you. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Okay. I'll try to be relatively short, because that's a lot to talk about. First, not all companies count awards impact all at the same way. We believe, we have a fairly conservative philosophy around how we book IDIQs both multiple award and single award. So as you compare our number with maybe two other companies that recently released, you need to get back to the definition. And I think, we're always trying to be conservative in the way we put our numbers forward. A little bit about business development. We have brought the two business development organizations together; we did that on day one. We built a business development pipeline. We came to consolidated CRM system. We de-conflicted the pipelines. It was just something that we needed to do. And then we have organized any campaigns against the major pursuits that are in the pipeline. There have been, and we have seen that acquisitions for which we expected decisions to have been made, have been delayed. In fact, we have seen nothing that has been accelerated yet, although there is some talk of that. The trend has been for things to be sole source extensions, for things to be postponed. And the NMCI Next Gen program, our best read of that is it could be delayed a year. And it is in our pipeline, and we have probably pushed it out in our pipeline over a year. What are we doing? We're doing what you would expect. We're looking at our people, our processes and tools around business development. We are looking at how we qualify in the pipeline to make sure that our pipeline is robust. And the good news is, we have a much broader set of customers for which to pursue new business, and that's been good. But Gerry Fasano, who runs business development, and his team are spending a lot of energy to make sure that we are chasing things for which we have a competitive discriminator, either in cost or in innovation. And I think we've already started to see benefit from that. A program I didn't mention, but clearly is out there. There's Army Field Artillery (sic) [Advanced Field Artillery] program that we refer to as AFATDS, Army Field Artillery Tactical Data System (sic) [Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System]. Again, another protest, another program that had been caught up in protest for a significant period of time, which we had hoped to have put in backlog earlier, which I think we've put in backlog, Jim, in the quarter. And it had been delayed at least a quarter, maybe two because it has been protested. But it was a nice win for us. And one we won, I believe, because of innovation and a technological discriminator. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tobey Sommer with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Roger, you alluded to some detail about GENESIS. Could you update us on the expected ramp in that program as you sort of get through the testing phase and roll out more rapidly? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. And by the way, we are on track with the discussions that we have had previously on the MHS GENESIS or what we call the Defense Health Management Systems Modernization program. We have two more sites which we really kind of look at as IOC sites. This year, we did Fairchild Air Force Base. We did Navy Hospital at Oak Harbor, and we have Madigan and one more site this year. And then we go into what's called waves, and we ramp up essentially to a wave a quarter over the next 12 to 18 months, which will put us sort of, we'll ramp up, and we'll be at sort of that peak installation level for several years. And then, at the end of the program, we start to ramp down. So you will see an increase for us in 2018, and probably another increase in 2019. Very consistent with the discussions we've had on that program in the past. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Krishna Sinha with Vertical Research. Please go ahead with your question. Krishna Sinha - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi, thanks. You raised your integration cost target by about $40 million. Is there any cash impact from that? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. There will be, but it is not likely to be seen until 2018. Right now, the program for integration is running really, really well. And while the benefits are taking hold faster than we expected, we're running a little bit under budget, so far. So when I think about that increase that we mentioned during the prepared remarks, that's going to happen next year, and I would think of that as maybe the top-end of what that estimate would be. Operator : Thank you. The next question's from the line of Brian Ruttenbur with Drexel Hamilton. Brian Ruttenbur - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Yes. Thank you very much. A couple quick questions. First of all, on bookings in third quarter. So you were weak in the first quarter, had good strength in the second quarter. I assume that seasonally, you'll have kind of peak book-to-bill in the third quarter, and then a drop-off in the fourth quarter. Is that what you anticipate? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Let's see, that's typically and historically what we have done. And we don't guide on bookings, but for all the reasons, our government customers tend to be cyclical. They try to get things under contract before the end of the fiscal year. That's our expectation. Brian Ruttenbur - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay. And as a follow-up, just on re-competes over the next 12 months, what percentage of your base is up for re-compete? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Typically, going into a year, what we've said before, and I think it still holds is that about 80% going in, we have visibility on it, either as run-off of existing backlog or follow-on work. So typically, about 20% of our annual revenue though, because the average contract life is five years, think about 20% of a given year's revenue going into the year, is coming from re-compete. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in for a quick follow-up. Can you just give us a sense on \u2013 on the first quarter call, you mentioned some unanticipated losses. I'm not sure if the NASA loss was one of those, or if that was incremental, and to what extent you anticipated it. But you also suggested that you were going to do a bit of a postmortem after those 1Q items. Can you give us an update on kind of what you uncovered, and what you're doing to address that and how you see your re-compete win rates, perhaps, trending going forward? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Okay. Let me be accurate and factual. The NASA MSOC program was a second quarter event, not a first quarter event. Now, let's again unpack that by saying, any time you're in a competition, expect to win. I think that's a strong statement. We're always \u2013 when we're in a competition, we always get a feel like we're in a competition. And I would like to think that we never go in and say, well, this is ours and we expect to win. The forensics are, did we write a proposal that reflected our capabilities, and were rescored by the Source Selection Board appropriate with the quality of innovative solution we put on the table; that's sort of what we assess. And in those competitions where I have been disappointed, I felt like we had a superior solution, we had some great technical differentiators, but we didn't get that \u2013 I don't think we got full credit in the evaluation. And so, that causes us to go back and say, all right, are we writing good proposals? Are we highlighting our differentiators? Did we get a good understanding of what we call Schedule M, which is the evaluation criteria in a proposal. And sometimes you worry about, well, if you're the incumbent, you can get a little comfortable that your discriminators are well-known by a customer, and you may not be as precise in your proposal as you need to be, those are kind of the things that we look at from a forensic standpoint. Did we write a good proposal? First of all, do we have an outstanding solution? And I think, we've always proposed outstanding solutions. But then, did we mechanically get that outstanding solution well-documented in the proposal that we submitted to the customer such that they evaluated it high, and we got high evaluative credit, in the way the SSEB, the Source Selection Evaluation Board, grades the proposals. And that's what we look at, by the way, we do forensics on all of our proposals, the ones that we win and the ones that we lose. And we try to understand what did we do well on the ones that we win. And when we lose one, where we thought we had an advantage because we deal with the customer well, we knew the solution, or we thought we had a piece of technology that should differentiate us. And we don't win, we always go back and say, okay, what was it that we didn't present well to the customer, and how can we do that better in following proposals. Operator : Thank you. At this time for closing remarks, I will turn the floor back to Kelly Freeman. Kelly Freeman - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Rob, and thank you all for your interest in Leidos and for your time this morning. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Leidos Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Results. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kelly Freeman, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Freeman. Kelly Freeman - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the Leidos management team. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter ending September 29, 2017. Roger Krone will lead off the call with comments on the market environment and our company strategy. Jim will follow with a discussion of our financial performance and our guidance expectations. After these remarks from Roger and Jim, we will open the call for your questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, includes risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, during the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation between the two is included in the press release that we issued this morning and is also available in the presentation slides. The press release and the presentation, as well as a supplementary financial information file, are provided on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.leidos.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, thanks, Kelly, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning for our third quarter 2017 earnings call, and thanks all of you for dialing in half an hour early and especially those who were up till midnight watching the World Series, and congratulations to the Houston Astros. Of course, it's a crowded day on earnings release. So, we've moved our call up half an hour to accommodate the schedule. Results for the quarter demonstrate continuing strong performance from the business. During the quarter, we delivered adjusted EBITDA margins of 10.9%. We secured $3.1 billion of new net bookings. We delivered $0.95 of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, and we also generated $268 million of cash from operations, allowing us to repay $125 million of debt and reduce our leverage ratio to our target of 3.0 times. In short, we had a solid third quarter and are focused on continuing our momentum and driving growth. The quarter and year-to-date results highlight the strength that comes from our uniquely diversified business composition. The diversification that we enabled through the IS&GS transaction, increasing our exposure to both civil and health markets, has meaningfully contributed to strong results we have seen this year. We have increasingly leveraged our scale not only within each of our three market segments, but also across the organization. This has allowed us to achieve some notable successes on the business development front, which position us well to drive future growth. A couple of notable program wins that demonstrate these successes include a $684 million single award task order in our Civil segment awarded by the Department of Homeland Security to provide operations, maintenance, security and optimization, as well as other services supporting the managed networks under the Secure Enterprise Network Systems, Services and Support or SENS3 Program. In our Health segment, we won a follow-on contract with the Social Security Administration with a ceiling value of $2.3 billion. Under this 10-year IDIQ, Leidos will provide lifecycle activities for software improvement, engineering and management support, database, data and systems administration, as well as security support. This win continues a long-standing relationship with the Social Security Administration, and we are proud to continue supporting their operational success. While quarterly bookings tend to be volatile, we did see a heightened level of award activity in the third quarter, as we typically do, coincident with the government fiscal yearend. In combination with the seasonal uptick, these winds contributed to our 1.2 book-to-bill ratio in the quarter and drove an end-of-quarter backlog position of $17.7 billion. We continue to focus on improving our top-line prospects by investing for growth. Our scale allows us to make a strategic commitment to internal growth initiatives, including internal R&D, bid and proposal activities and capital expenditures; and leverage this investment for the benefit of our customers in the form of innovative, yet cost-effective technical solutions. We continually refine our investments in these areas as we engage with the customers, and we have recently identified additional areas for capital investment that we expect will generate meaningful returns in future years. Jim will share more details on this in his remarks. As the investment option with the highest expected return, internal growth initiatives will continue to be a priority for capital deployment going forward. Expanding on capital deployment, as I indicated earlier, we did reach our target leverage ratio during the quarter. Consistent with our prior statements, we can now pivot to a more flexible capital deployment posture. Beyond debt reduction and internal investments, which we have been doing since the transaction closed, reaching the 3.0 times leverage ratio target provides us relief from some debt covenants, which had previously restricted our ability to deploy excess capital through meaningful share repurchase or M&A. We are pleased to once again have the full breadth of options more readily available to us, as we look to deploy our excess capital in the best long-term interest of our shareholders. From a macro perspective, the recent passage of a joint budget resolution is positive as it provides spending guidelines for an increased defense top line above the sequester caps and assumes non-defense discretionary spending will not be cut as deeply as the budget request. In addition, the administration's fiscal year 2017 budget amendment and the House and Senate defense authorization bills, all point to higher spending levels in 2018, and we are optimistic this will come to fruition. That said, there is still much work to be done as we look beyond the expiration of the current continuing resolution on December 8. However, as we focus on our strategic direction and what is within our control, this macro backdrop reinforces our belief that we are well positioned with our capabilities and customer exposure to benefit from the priorities of the administration and the related budget dollars. In closing, I am pleased with our results in the third quarter and year-to-date. I am further encouraged with what lies ahead. We have a focus at all levels of the organization on growing the top line and collaborating across segments to ensure we have the most innovative and cost-effective solutions to offer our customers as they look to accomplish their missions. We have a rigorous plan for success in continuing cost synergy capture and have a clear line of sight to future savings enabled by key milestones early in 2018. And finally, we have an organization of 32,000 dedicated and unparalleled professionals committed to delivering excellent program performance for our customers and increased value for our shareholders. With that, let me hand the call over to Jim Reagan, Leidos' Chief Financial Officer, for more details on the quarter and our full year outlook. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Roger, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call early this morning. Roger has already shared the highlights of the quarter with you and the full details of our results are in the press release, so I will just provide some thematic commentary to give some context to the numbers and that will leave you all for some more time for questions on this call. Revenues of $2.5 billion in the quarter grew 34% over the prior-year period, which reflected a partial year's contribution from the IS&GS business. Non-GAAP adjusted EBIDTA margin of 10.9% surpassed our expectations and was driven by a combination of; first, strong program performance; second, a slower-than-expected ramp down of some key high-margin programs which we've discussed on prior calls; and third, an elevated level of program write-ups reflecting the continued achievements of our cost reduction programs. Non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.95 benefited from this strong margin performance as well as a slightly lower-than-expected effective tax rate. In line with typical seasonality, we had a strong quarter for cash flow from operations. Due to the timing of previously disclosed systems transitions associated with the IS&GS transaction, we continue to have an elevated days sales outstanding, or DSOs, during the third quarter, exiting the quarter at 65 days. As we've said in the past, we expect this to reduce in the fourth quarter and are now targeting a year-end DSO level of approximately 62 days. Note that we do expect cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter to come in below the third quarter levels, again, in line with seasonality. Now, for a quick update on our integration activities. We remain on track with plans to consolidate financial systems in the first quarter of 2018. Remember that this is instrumental to realizing a step function increase in cost synergies. In total, through the third quarter, we've realized approximately $300 million in run rate cost synergies relative to our targeted level of over $400 million, in addition to the already realized $121 million of day one cost synergies. Our expectation of expenses required to achieve the target level of synergies is unchanged. Our cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the quarter was $287 million, in line with our targeted cash levels of $200 million to $300 million. During Q3, we continue to make progress in reducing our future interest cost through three actions. First, we repaid $125 million of our debt; second, we refinanced our term loans A and B, reducing applicable spreads by 25 basis points; and, third, we executed an additional $300 million of interest rate swaps, bringing the fixed portion of the debt portfolio up to 66% from prior levels of approximately 54%. Now, let me share some details on our segment results. Again, the details and the numbers are in the press release. Their revenue comparisons are less meaningful given the partial quarter of IS&GS revenues in the prior-year period. But for some additional context, particularly on margins, let me provide this. Starting in our Defense Solutions segment. We had some nice wins in the quarter, although, as is increasingly the case, a significant portion of these wins was linked to new IDIQs and thus not recognized in bookings during the quarter. Notably, we were awarded a $1 billion single award IDIQ contract and the corresponding first task order, which has been protested and therefore is not included in our book-to-bill numbers. Our non-GAAP operating income margin of 8.4% in the quarter declined 40 basis points sequentially, reflecting the ramp down of certain higher margin contracts. In our Civil segment, we achieved a new high watermark for non-GAAP operating income margin at 11.2%. This was driven by the higher level of cost reductions discussed earlier, as well as robust program performance. Notably, this quarter was the first quarter of our recognition of gain share on the LCST contract. As a reminder, this contract allows for us to share with the Ministry of Defense the savings enabled through the implementation of our systems and infrastructure. Our Health segment continue to perform very well, both on revenue and margin as we continued to benefit from increased on-contract growth and, again, a higher level than expected contribution from a couple of programs which are performing well. These programs provided uplifts to margins beyond what we consider steady-state levels with non-GAAP OI at 16.4%, a slight uptick from the prior quarter. We believe that the contributions from these programs will return to a more normalized level in Q1. With that, I'll move on to guidance. As Roger previously previewed, our strong performance year-to-date which continued through Q3 gives us confidence to revise in upward elements of our guidance. Our expectations for revenue remain unchanged at a range of $10.1 billion to $10.4 billion. We now expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 10.2% to 10.4%, up from our prior range of 9.8% to 10.2%. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $3.60 to $3.75, up from the prior range of $3.45 to $3.60. Our guidance for cash flow from operations is now at or above $490 million, up from prior guidance of at or above $475 million. A few other notes related to our guidance. We're increasing our CapEx estimate for the year by about $15 million to $75 million, driven by specific additional investments we have already identified, which we believe will directly drive future revenue and profit growth. We're also revising our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in a range of 34.5% to 35%, down from our prior range of 35% to 35.5%. Finally, our guidance continues to embed an assumption that the government will be operating under a continuing resolution for the balance of 2017. In conclusion, we are pleased with our performance to-date, and we're confident that we're well positioned to achieve our targets. We remain focused on addressing the most critical challenges of our customers while driving growth, increasing profitability and generating cash. Rob, now, it's time to open it up for some questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Jon. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Jim, just a quick question on that CapEx number. Can you talk about some of the specific things that you're looking at investing in? And also, should we assume that $75 million is the new run rate, or is this kind of a one-time spend that comes down later? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: First, Jon, thanks for dialing in so early. The uptick in CapEx is more \u2013 right now, we think of it as a one-time bump up. It is on a particular program that we're probably not at liberty to give you many details on due to the nature of the work we're doing there. But I would tell you that it's for a fixed asset and not an intangible, and it's related to delivering on a specific program for a defense customer. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thank you for that. And then, also, on margin sustainability, I think over a year ago when you laid out the targets for 2018 plus, and they're in the slides again this morning, you talked about above 10% and that anything too far above 10% should really be invested back into the company. So, with that said and the guidance where it is for this year, is this a number \u2013 the 10.2% to 10.4% that is \u2013 is that a number you expect to improve upon going forward as you get more benefit from the combination? Or should we expect to see some of this EBITDA growth come more from the sales side than the margin side in 2018? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Jon, the way we think about this is, first, the strong margin performance that we had year-to-date is primarily \u2013 again, it's two things. It's our ability to achieve \u2013 it's really three things. First, our ability to achieve the cost reductions that we had been expecting a bit faster than we previously planned. The second thing is that our programs and the people on the ground executing are doing a fantastic job of delivering on programs without any material speed bumps that you normally have and you can normally expect in a complex integration of two large businesses like that. And the third thing that I would tell you is we do have a couple of programs that are delivering during kind of a certain phase of their program lifecycle better and higher margins than would be typical, and that's when you hear me talked a little bit earlier about things that we consider temporal increases in margins in the health business, and we even have one of those in the defense business as well. That said, as we continue rolling up our plans for 2018, we'll have better visibility into what the margin should be for 2018 and beyond, and we'll talk more about that in our call in February. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: All right. Thanks. I'll hop back in the queue. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Jon. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Cai von Rumohr, CFA - Cowen & Company, LLC: Yes. Thank you very much, and good quarter. So, maybe, if you give us some color on what percent of your awards were new business and maybe some color on the amount of protests outstanding of programs that you've won. How big are those? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Cai, and good morning. I'll talk a little bit about the protests, and I'll ask Jim to think about how we break out the $3.1 billion in awards between new. But we continue to see protest activity frankly across the board. We probably have low-double digit number of programs involved in a protest in some way. That's both defending protests against business that we've won and then frankly filing protests on some businesses that we lost that we believe we should have won. Though we don't really disclose a hard number of how much potential revenue is tied up in protest, I would let you know that it is in the billions. So, if you were to add up all the programs, the number would be greater than $1 billion. And Jim mentioned one in his prepared remarks that in and of itself gets us over that threshold. And it is just the world that we live in and we try to take that into account when we forecast when these awards are going to roll into revenue. So, I don't know, Jim, if you want to talk about the split. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yes. So, Cai, when you take a look at the net new bookings, you can think of it as roughly 85% new. But the one trend that we've been seeing in the quarter \u2013 in the year so far is that more of our new booking spend is typical \u2013 is related to on-contract growth and extensions of existing contracts. As we're seeing in certain procurements, customers are \u2013 rather than go through their normal five-year cycle of re-procuring something, they will ask the incumbent, and in this case it's us, to stay on longer while they're delaying procurement due to a variety of factors. The one other point that I would make and it amplifies, I think, on the question on protests. We would have a nice \u2013 a bit of a higher book-to-bill if it hadn't been for the protests of this single-award IDIQ that was protested shortly after the close of the quarter. And just a reminder for you that single-award IDIQs where we've got a lot of runway that we don't have to compete for, we don't book those by policy until we get specific task orders, and we consider that a pretty prudent and conservative way to go about thinking about book-to-bill. Cai von Rumohr, CFA - Cowen & Company, LLC: So, given the large number of protests that you have, what does this say about potential for bookings in the fourth quarter, which seasonally tends to be not quite as strong as the third? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, Cai, I think you've kind of answered the question, but we obviously expect it to go down, but it's a 99-day process if they go the full limit on a GAO protest. And depending upon when the protest was filed, we now have a couple where, depending upon how you count the days, it could get resolved within the fourth quarter, or some of these could actually extend over into first quarter. I think we've touched on this a little bit throughout the year, which is you write a proposal, you work really hard. By the way, this is true across the industry. You win, and then it gets protested, and you hope it will be resolved in 99 days. We've had programs that have been protested more than once. So, unfortunately, the trend now is that things move to the right. I think your question was more about we expect some more strength in the fourth quarter given the number of protests. I think one could see their way to that. But then, again, there may be some awards that we have planned for the fourth quarter that, therefore, will slide into first. Cai von Rumohr, CFA - Cowen & Company, LLC: And the last one, as you've kind of achieved your cost cuts, you've indicated in the past that you've taken your wrap rates down. Maybe give us the sequence of what we should look for going forward. And have the results of those lower wrap rates resulted in booking success you might otherwise not have had? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yes. Cai, this is Jim. Clearly, we have seen some benefit in win rates of a lower than expected \u2013 or I should say lower than previously realized wrap rates. And when we lose \u2013 and it's a pretty competitive market out there. We're seeing that the reasons for losing are more often something other than price. And so, we're comfortable now that we've made great progress in being more price competitive. With that said, we're never going to stop working toward continuing to lean out the cost structure for reasons that we've said before. Number one, it gives us greater capability to invest more in other growth initiatives, whether it's in business development things or the ability to invest more in research and development, et cetera. So, right now, we're able to look at taking some of these cost savings and investing them back in the business. Cai von Rumohr, CFA - Cowen & Company, LLC: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Rob. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hi, Rob. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Jim, what was the organic growth in the quarter? And I guess that applies particularly to defense systems. And then, what's the embedded expectation in the fourth quarter based on the guidance? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yes. Rob, let me really comment more on the data relative to IS&GS versus the legacy Leidos growth rates, because I think that \u2013 and that will roughly follow what we're seeing in the defense side. The IS&GS year-over-year numbers are up. This is primarily because of procurement on \u2013 for direct materials on certain contracts. On the Leidos side, we kind of had the opposite going on, where certain defense programs showed a little bit of decline year-over-year primarily because the big fulfillment center that we were building for the Ministry of Defense in the U.K., which was a direct pass-through without a whole lot of margin, that has wound down. And a couple of other programs in the defense side where we had some direct pass-throughs were down. So, as we've said before, the \u2013 relative to the rest of the business, the defense bookings have been a little bit lighter. And so, we're looking at more in this quarter. And I think that in the next couple of quarters, we're probably going to see a little bit stronger growth on the civil and on the health side of the business. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Is there a way to think about \u2013 this is a question for either of you \u2013 about what the normalized organic growth should be in defense across both companies, the legacy business and IS&GS? Or maybe the better way to ask the question is, what's the normalized organic growth for Defense Solutions once you get through some of these headwinds? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yes. I think that \u2013 we're looking at \u2013 and this is based on an analysis of our pipeline, what the submits look like and where we think we're placed on some of the larger bids outstanding in defense that a 3% normalized growth rate on the defense side in 2018 and beyond is what we should expect. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then, just in that context, how do we think about the company's exposure to readiness? Obviously, there's quite a bit of discussion going on inside the Beltway about what might happen in \u2013 with regard to North Korea. The army has been emphasizing readiness. The entire military has been emphasizing it, particularly at AUSA a couple weeks back. We heard a lot about that. What do you see in your own business? Is there an upside element to this for 2018, or is it just simply too soon to tell? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: I think we both can cover that, Rob. First of all, those contracts that we have where we support troops overseas and mission, I would say pretty much across the board we've seen \u2013 and I think we've said this even last quarter. We've seen moderate upticks. We all know we have more troops in Afghanistan than we did a year ago. And if there's \u2013 think about a ratio that for every soldier that's in Afghanistan there are three or four contractors that support that soldier. We have a couple, I think, very important programs in that theater and we've seen increased activity on those programs. We really haven't put out a dollar number for O&M. But it's probably around 10% of revenue that's somehow connected to activities of U.S. forces overseas. And we're seeing, again, increased activity across the board in that area. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you, both. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Krishna Sinha with Vertical Research. Please go ahead with your question. Krishna Sinha - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi. Thanks. So, you talked about the 3% revenue growth target. And I guess this is just building off the question that Rob just asked. But it looks like the legacy Leidos business is down sort of 5.5%. I know IS&GS has been growing since the last quarter. I think it was up 6% last quarter, probably up again in this quarter. Next year, we know you'll get some tailwind from GENESIS installations. So, maybe that's 1% to 2% of that 3% growth. But what's the other \u2013 I guess, what's the other mechanism to pull you up to 3% growth? Is it more IS&GS work? I just \u2013 can you just help us with the moving parts there in terms of that 3%? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, yes. Krishna, you mentioned that the GENESIS contract, as we've said before, is going to provide a tailwind and lift. We've also got \u2013 I just mentioned a number of contracts, including one like the billion dollar single award IDIQ, where there is \u2013 there are a number of things kind of queued up in terms of potential task orders or, I should say, likely task orders that will start to give some meaningful tailwind. And that's just by way of example. There are a number of others. We have about $22 billion worth of bids in the pipeline that have been submitted and are awaiting award by the customer. And so, when we put together the bottoms-up view of next year's business and this \u2013 it's \u2013 we don't guide by segment. But when we look at Defense, Health and Civil all wrapped together, look at our existing run-out of contracts that are currently enforced and the $22 billion of submits and when they're layering into our award schedule. That's the basis upon which we built that view. But again, we're feeling pretty good about the recent awards, albeit the ones \u2013 including the ones that are protested and that's where we're getting that sense of about a 3% growth. And we'll have more details on that when we have our February call and have laid our plans for 2018 in place. Krishna Sinha - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. That's great. Thank you very much. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Sure. Operator : The next question is from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Noah. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Noah. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So, forgive me if this is a super obvious question. But I just want to confirm. You are, today, with this report and on this call forecasting the total company organic revenue growth to be 3% in 2018. Is that correct? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yes. Let's just reiterate. So, from the guidance that we put out, obviously, we left revenue guidance where it has been. All right? We have been consistent since the Investor Day last August of 3% top line, and we have made no changes to our revenue guidance or that 3% line \u2013 3% number that we put out over a year ago. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. This 3% \u2013 correct me if I'm wrong. But the 3% from the Investor Day was a compound annual growth rate for 2017, 2018, 2019. And so, honing in on just 2018 would be a little different than that. I'm just curious if you're \u2013 if you have enough visibility to be saying 2018 is 3%. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yes. And, Noah, I'm sure you anticipate this answer is, today, we are not putting out guidance specifically for 2018. It's not our process. I'm just reiterating the comments that we had made in the past, and we see no reason to change the comments that we had made earlier. And as Jim has said \u2013 and I don't mean to be evasive on this. It's just our policy. We will put out guidance for 2018 with our February earnings call. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, I guess, my other question on that is, if the target was 3% for a CAGR 2017, 2018 and 2019 and 2017 is shaping up to be closer to flat, then actually that statement to the extent you're standing by it would imply that one or both of 2018 or 2019 would actually be faster than 3% to get those three years to average 3%. Is that the right way to think about that three-year window? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Okay. Noah, thanks. Nice try. It is \u2013 we're just not going to go there. All right? We said 3% CAGR at Investor Day... James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: For 2018 and beyond. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: For 2018 and beyond, and we're just not going to address any more specifics about revenue guidance in 2018 and beyond until we're ready to do that in February so... Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. I thought that CAGR was for 2017, 2018 and 2019. You're saying it's for 2018 and beyond. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: But that's \u2013 yes, that's in the charts that we had at the Investor Day last August and recently. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: For 2018 and beyond? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: That's what the \u2013 that's what we said. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Is it accurate that \u2013 one of the prior questions was that DHMSM adds a point or two of growth next year. Is that accurate? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: We haven't said what that program will contribute specifically. And again, we don't provide program level details on revenue or what their contribution would be. It is \u2013 I mean, you can \u2013 we've talked about the kind of the camel hump of revenue picture that goes between 2018 and 2020, actually 2022 with kind of that peaking in roughly 2020, and it's a $4 billion, $4.5 billion program. So, you can kind of interpolate the math that way. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. The CapEx elevation you mentioned, is that \u2013 were you saying that's for a classified program? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. It is \u2013 I don't know that the government calls it classified. They call it sensitive. At least, it's a sensitive program that the customer would rather us not talk in detail about. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Is it not DHMSM? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: It is not DHMSM. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: It is a defense program. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. Thank you. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Noah. Operator : Thank you. And due to the large number of analysts for our question session today, please ask one question and one follow-up question. Our next question is from the line of Brian Ruttenbur with Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ruttenbur - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay. Just two questions, and I'll narrow it down. The first one is about debt. The ratio now that you've hit your target. Is the plan buybacks? Is it going to be paying down more debt? Is it acquisitions? Can you talk about where you want to focus the cash flow going forward? And then, the second question is on rebids. Can you talk about the major ones coming up in 2018 and what percentage of your portfolio is up for rebid? And I'll shut up. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. So, first, we're pleased to be at this debt to EBITDA of 3.0 times. It's about 1/4 ahead of where we expected it to be. And I think it reflects, really, a bit better than expected cash flow since we closed the deal. And with that, we're very comfortable with the leverage level that we're at today, particularly given that we've been able to contain the spread on LIBOR and get roughly 2/3 of it fixed. And those things allow us to think about the next priorities for where to put cash. What we've said previously, in not this priority order, but we've talked about taking that cash, investing it for growth, more R&D, continued competitive pricing on fixed priced and T&M kind of work, so that we can enhance our win rates there. We've also talked about returning capital to shareholders, either through share buybacks or enhancing the dividend and then possible M&A. And I think that your question really speaks to, are we thinking about possible acquisitions? We're always looking at opportunities that are before us, some of them that are tuck-in and things that augment our capability and our resume. But also, things that might be a little bit more of scale are not completely off the table, although we're still very focused on integrating \u2013 finishing the integration work on the IS&GS business. So, again, not any particular order there, but we are looking at all those options. And then, as it relates to big things in the pipeline, we don't talk about specific bids that we're looking at, for obvious reasons. But in any given year, the new awards that we're looking at are roughly 85% new or takeaways from competitors with anywhere from 15%, some years, it's 20%, coming from growing existing contracts. And then, the rest of our revenue, roughly 80% in any given year comes from stuff that's already on the books. Brian Ruttenbur - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Thank you. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Brian. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Sheila. Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC : Good morning. So, I guess, first, on the healthcare business, can you maybe talk a little bit more specifically about the ramp within the GENESIS program? And then, just on margins, how sustainable is this? When do we kind of see a little bit of a falloff as the ramp starts to pick up? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yes. Thanks for your questions. I'll just give you some updates on what's going on, on the Defense Health program. You've probably read that we have gone live at our fourth IOC site at Madigan, which was, that being an IT installation, relatively successful here, not without some tickets being written, but we're really, really pleased with how the team is performing and how that's going forward. Now, the way the program was always structured, we've got our IOC sites and we're going to operate those really through the rest of the year. And then, in the spring, we start to roll out implementations of the GENESIS program in waves. And so, we start the ramp-up towards the back half of next year. And as Jim said, we start implementing waves and we stay at that level until about 2022 and then we ramp down. As we install the new software at the hospitals and care facilities, there is a sustainment piece of this, which will grow. So, I mean, you probably have your model and you can look at implementations, you can add a sustainment line and build what we've always talked about, our one-hump camel. But we will see growth in the program next year. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. And then, Sheila, relative to the margin question that you had, as I kind of intimated in my remarks earlier, we're very pleased that the Health business is performing and generating the kind of margins that it is. But we want to be clear that we don't view the 16.4% that we had in the quarter as sustainable over the long haul because there are a number of contracts that we have that are generating \u2013 because of where they stand, it's this wonderful, perfect storm of things where there are \u2013 several contracts are at the same time in a phase of higher margin that will begin to wind down and go back to a more normalized level. And again, we don't guide margin at the segment level. But I do want to make sure everyone is clear that the 16.4% is not something that we look to sustain into 2018. Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC : Got it. And I guess, just one follow-up. Does a healthcare have a larger portion of re-competes as we enter 2018 or is it similar across segments? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: I think, in 2018, the level of re-competes will be lower than we had in 2017. We've gone through a cycle of re-competes. And again, we have visibility into what the profit picture is on the work that we've won in re-competes and that will \u2013 because we were working to make sure we win those, the margins will be a bit lower on some of those. Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tobey Sommer with SunTrust Robinson. Please proceed with your question. Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you very much. The first question is about margin. And does your backlog pipeline, in kind of a spending climate, suggest an environment that you could maintain a 10%-plus EBITDA margin as an outlook? And then, I was wondering if you could comment on your positioning for a potential VA healthcare system overhaul. Thank you. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Tobey, I'll start and just speak to the view of margin, and then Roger will talk about the VA overhaul opportunity. Yes, our belief is that \u2013 again, we manage programs in a portfolio fashion and when we look at what the portfolio of bids outstanding looks like as well as the margins on backlog that we have in house, we're confident that we can make good on the promise we made over a year ago of margins at or above 10% on the EBITDA line. So, yeah, we remain confident in that. Roger? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yes. In VA, writ large is they are taking sort of a strategic view of modernizing a lot of their IT systems across the board. We already have a scheduling contract with the VA, which we refer to as VA Mass (46:12), where we're working with a major healthcare vendor to put in a new scheduling system. But I think the one you're specifically asking about is electronic healthcare records program that was announced in June with Cerner as prime. We have a great relationship with Cerner. We provide a lot of value to the VA. I think the way that will roll out is \u2013 and Cerner had a call either this week or last week. I think what they said was they're in negotiations with the VA to get their prime contract in place. And when that happens and we'll have conversations with Cerner about how we can help them provide the level of healthcare records to our veterans that they need. And we are hopeful that we will have a meaningful role in the program going forward. Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Thanks for fitting me back in. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Sure, Jon. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: A question on the Defense. You mentioned the bookings are a bit light compared to the other segments and also that, when you lose, it's not because of price. So, I'm curious, how are you improving on some of the other dynamics? What have been some of the lessons you've learned thus far? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: I think that the lessons learned are to get a little bit more focused on the depth of understanding we have of what the customer is looking for, make sure we write better proposals and that we have an account management team that is in the customer site every day. And we've spent the last year making sure that we put the right people in the right slots and that we get them installed and in spending time with the customers and that will enable us to be a little bit closer to the pin in terms of what customers are looking for when we submit proposals. But the thing that we are finding is that the \u2013 again, I'm not saying 100% of the time, but the wrap rates are these days not getting in the way of winning. Anything else, Roger? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: No. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Jon. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Poponak, your line is open for questions. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Sorry. I was on mute there. What is the dollar amount of IS&GS synergies left to be gained in 2018 versus 2017? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: In terms of on a run rate basis, it is not going to be much more than what we're experiencing now, Noah. The next step function in synergies is going to come primarily from two areas. One of them, the reduction in cost that we have today of sustaining two significant large ERP systems that came over from Lockheed Martin, as we migrate those onto the legacy Leidos platform. That is \u2013 that's systems cost. That's software maintenance cost that is \u2013 and the cost of people and process within IT and finance. The second big slug of synergies \u2013 and we will achieve a step function on that next year but also in the following years on real estate. The \u2013 we're continuing our process of consolidating vacant space. A lot of it here in the national capital region, but also in other locations around the country. The bulk of it is here around the national capital region, and that will also give us part of this step function of synergies. Right now, we're pleased to be at a run rate synergy number of about $300 million. And again, we've said that we're going to get to $400 million or better by the time we're finished. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. All of that sounded like a pretty healthy step-up in 2018 versus 2017 except for your very first sentence, which said there wouldn't be one. Do you know what I mean? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: No, no, no. Noah, I don't think \u2013 I think what we said was, for 2017, we've made most of the systems changes that will affect the creation of cross linkage and synergies in our cost structure. And it won't be until early in 2018 that we consolidate our general ledgers, our large ERP system. I think what we said was you could see most of that $100 million next year. There's not a lot of room left in calendar year 2017 beyond the $300 million that we announced on this call that we have achieved. I mean, there'll probably be maybe single digit millions. But the next big event for us will be to bring the back-end accounting systems together in a Costpoint Deltek system. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: All right. Got it. Roger, when you were talking about capital deployment flexibility with the leverage ratio getting where you wanted it to be, I think you used the word meaningful in description of possible share repurchase. Can you maybe elaborate on that and quantify what kind of level we could be looking at, even if it's further down the road? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Well, okay. So, we obviously choose those words with much thought. And what I was trying to indicate to all of us, right, to you is that, if we initiate a buyback program, it would be significant. We're not going to buy back just our creep, if you will. But it is just one of the options that we consider when we meet with our finance committee on a quarterly basis. And if we initiate a program, it will be meaningful. Again, it won't just be trivial. We're not just going to buy back our dilution due to executive comp. And that's the message that we're trying to put out. But I also want to reiterate what we did on the call, which is there's a tax reform bill that seems to be making its way through Congress. We're going to get a new Fed chairman, it would appear, sometime this week. And so, all those things affect our cost of capital and how we're going to redeploy our excess cash, and we will make thoughtful decisions about how we do that based upon our appetite for cash and in driving organic growth and the options we have to efficiently return that capital to our owners. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: And one more thing, Noah. Kelly just pointed out to me that, when I answered your question just a moment ago, I said that there wasn't more opportunity in 2018. I meant to say there wasn't much more opportunity in 2017. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: I know I kind of contradicted myself by then saying there's another $100 million next year. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Here's all the opportunity. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yes, right. So, my apologies there for confusing you. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: No. That makes a lot more sense and sounds like a lot of opportunity. Just one more then since you brought up tax. Before any \u2013 assuming there wouldn't be a tax reform bill, what should we be using for long run normalized annualized tax rate for the company? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Noah, I'm afraid we're going to have to hold off until we do our \u2013 finish our tax plan for next year. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: I mean, what you've seen so far is that we've made improvements over, what, a year or two ago. We had a normalized rate of 37%, and we've been doing better than that. We've got a new head of tax who's doing a great job for us in helping us do better planning and \u2013 but with that said, you'll just have to wait until we have more to say about that in the February call. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Noah. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session for today. Now, I'll turn the call back to Kelly Freeman for closing remarks. Kelly Freeman - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Rob, and thank you, all, for joining us a bit early on the call today. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kelly Freeman, Director of Investor Relations Please go ahead. Kelly Freeman - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the Leidos management team. Today, we'll discuss our results for the quarter ending December 29, 2017. Roger will lead off the call with notable highlights from the year as well as comments on the market environment and our company's strategy. Jim will follow with a discussion of our financial performance and our guidance expectations. After these remarks from Roger and Jim, we'll open up the call for your questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, during the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in the press release that we issued this morning and is also available in the presentation slides. The press release and the presentation as well as the supplementary financial information file are provided on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.leidos.com. With that, I will turn the call over to Roger Krone. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Kelly, and thank you, all, for joining us this morning for our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 earnings conference call. Leidos had another great year of performance in 2017 with many operational successes resulting in strong financial results. I want to start my commentary by thanking our employees for their dedication to the significant effort incurred to realize the potential of our transaction. Our employees were able to stay focused on delivering for our customers and finding new opportunities to grow the business while making the difficult decisions required to drive synergy and become leaner and more agile as an organization, as we exited the integration of the IS&GS Business. As a consequence of this activity, I am proud to report some of the more notable highlights of our 2017 results. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased by 145 bps from the prior year to 10.4%, driven in large part by delivering strong program performance and outperforming our cost synergy targets. Our commitment to delivering innovative solutions to our customers on time and on budget has been recognized and rewarded. We emerged from the integration with an even stronger culture, focused on agility and innovation. I'm especially pleased with how well the team has come together at all levels of the organization. At Leidos, we are building the going-forward culture of customer focus, delivery on commitments, and taking care of our people. We designed an organization that can offer our customers a wide portfolio of solutions to their toughest problems, from those requiring the leanest of cost structures to those requiring the most high end technical capabilities. This flexible approach positions us well to grow our business. We booked roughly $10 billion of new awards into backlog and continue to await decisions on another $24 billion of submitted proposals. We generated over $0.5 billion of cash from operations and returned $198 million to shareholders through dividends while deploying $209 million to lower our outstanding debt. More importantly, as we look to drive growth across our business, the investments and focus on improving our business development activities and processes has resulted in improved win rates. While this takes time to translate meaningfully to revenue, it certainly increases our confidence in the actions we are taking and the strategy against which we are executing. As we look to 2018 with the majority of the integration activities having been successfully concluded, we are more singularly focused on growth. With the right cost structure, the right portfolio of capabilities and the right people in place, we are eager to deliver innovative solutions at best value to more customers around the world. As Jim will detail for you further in his remarks, we expect to grow the business in 2018. This expected inflection in our growth rate in 2018 reflects the impact of our 2017 accomplishments. First, in 2017, we continued to optimize our cost structure, resulting in more than $350 million of cost synergies achieved thus far, considerably more than we had expected at the onset of the deal. However, this resulted in a growth headwind in 2017 due to decreased revenues on cost-plus programs. With most of the cost reduction activities now concluded, we do not expect to see this effect in 2018, thus removing this headwind from our future. Additionally, during 2017, we added 28 IDIQ vehicles to our already broad portfolio. While these don't contribute materially to our backlog in the year, we believe we are well positioned to recognize tangible value from these vehicles, further aiding our growth in 2018. Finally, as we have shared with you, since the transaction closed and continuing through 2017, we have taken actions to improve our business development processes and modernize our proposal center. The improvement in win rates we have experienced as a result of these actions gives us greater confidence in the expected return on our bid and proposal expenditures. As such, we are increasing our investment in this area in 2018. We remain focused in our BD activities on leveraging our lean cost structure and broad technical capabilities to deliver better value and more innovative solutions to our customers. Notably, just since the beginning of the year, we have won several significant programs. A few highlights to share on these. We successfully defended a 2017 protest on a single-award IDIQ fixed price contract with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency which has a five-year ordering period and a total contract ceiling of $988 million. We have already received the first task order and begun work on this contract in the future. We also successfully defended our incumbent position on a couple of re-competes with classified customers and received approximately $500 million of awards on these in the first quarter. These successes, combined with the improved win rate and the incremental investment we are committed to our new business development activities, give me confidence that we are positioned for and executing on a strategy designed to deliver top line growth at or above our long-term margin target. Also increasing our confidence in 2018 and beyond is the recently passed two-year budget agreement authorizing a record budget for The Pentagon at roughly $700 billion for defense in 2018 and $716 billion for 2019. As most things do in Washington, the budgetary environment has evolved differently than I believe many were expecting a year ago and that the expectations of a higher level of defense spending has taken more time to work through the budgetary process. The recent budget agreement includes three key aspects, which we believe will provide nice tailwinds to the industry. First, the agreement removes the budget caps for 2018 and 2019 and removes the debt ceiling. Second, the agreement includes very strong budget authority numbers for both national security and civil agencies. Third, the two-year agreement suggests a predictable and hopefully a timely start for fiscal year 2019, allowing for the possibility of noticeable improvement in the procurement environment. That said, increases from the new government fiscal 2018 and 2019 budgets will take time to materialize into revenue given the lag between outlays and budget authority, but we do expect to benefit from a higher level of outlays in 2018 associated with prior year budgets. The appropriation bills will provide additional detail in the coming weeks, but we continue to believe we are well positioned with the stated defense strategy to benefit from these tailwinds. Before I hand the call over to Jim to provide more details on our financials and our guidance, I want to spend a moment discussing the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on our business. Although we are still evaluating some of the elements of the act, we are prepared to discuss a few areas at this time. First, as a near full rate taxpayer, we expect to see a material reduction in our overall effective tax rate due to the new 21% federal rate. Second, we plan to invest more in our bid and proposal area through specific initiatives targeting increased top line growth. Third, we plan to invest more in technology and capital to increase our advantage in offering innovative solutions to our customers. Finally, we remain committed to our capital deployment philosophy. As we have consistently indicated, we consider a number of options for capital deployment, including regular dividends, share repurchase, debt reduction and investing for growth in the business both organically and through M&A. On this topic, we announced this morning the approval by our board of a share repurchase authorization up to 20 million shares. This will allow us additional flexibility to deploy our excess cash. In the near-term, we expect to be in the market from time to time in order to, at a minimum, offset the effects of share creep from our compensation programs. Now, I'd like to spend a moment to thank our former Chairman and CEO, John Jumper, for his service to Leidos. As you may have seen earlier this week, we announced John's intent to retire from the board at the end of his term in May. Throughout John's 11-year tenure with the company, his legacy of leadership and counsel set us on a path that will endure as we continue to grow Leidos as a global technology leader. John came to Leidos after a long and decorated career in the United States Air Force, retiring in 2005 as its Chief of Staff. In conclusion, I am pleased with the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017. And I am confident that the efforts we undertook to improve our cost structure and increase our technical capabilities will serve us well in driving growth in 2018 and beyond. With that, let me hand the call over to Jim Reagan, Leidos' Chief Financial Officer, for more details on our results and 2018 outlook. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Roger, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. I'll start first with remarks on the impact of the Tax Act before providing thematic commentary around the numbers we released this morning. The reduction in the federal corporate rate resulting from the Tax Act does enable a reduction in our non-GAAP effective tax rate beginning in 2018, whereas previously, we have suggested a nominal tax rate in the mid to high 30s inclusive of state taxes, we're \u2013 we now expect our effective tax rate to be in the 23% to 24% range. Consistent with the intent of the Tax Act, we plan to invest some of these below-the-line savings to enhance the growth of our business. Specifically, we intend to increase our bid and proposal budget to better execute against our growing pipeline. As the investment within the company that generates the highest ROI and particularly with the improving win rates that Roger indicated, we believe that the returns here will be meaningful to the business. Additionally, beyond the reduction in the corporate tax rate, the act included several changes to other tax provisions. One of these allows for the immediate expensing of capital assets beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017, which accelerates the after-tax returns on such capital investments. With immediate expensing and lower rates, we now have a broader portfolio of investments that meet our acceptable threshold for ROIC. While most of our CapEx investments to-date have been facilities-related, we have always evaluated a select set of technology investments as well. We remain committed to our capital-light business model, but we now have some opportunities where increased CapEx investments will enable us to exploit our technical discriminators that we expect will ultimately generate higher returns. As such, we expect to increase capital investments in 2018, with $80 million being a new steady-state level of CapEx for the company, up from our prior view of roughly $60 million. Additionally, due to the 2017 enactment date of the Tax Act, we did see some benefit in the fourth quarter, which I'll touch on shortly. Let me now spend a moment on our full-year 2017 results. Overall, we are pleased with the strong results we delivered in 2017, particularly against our cash and margin targets and more so with how well we believe we are positioned going into 2018. I'll start with a few highlights from our full-year results before discussing our fourth quarter performance. First, margins for the year significantly exceeded our initial views of 9.5% to 10%, with adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.4%. This was accomplished through intense focus on excellent program performance as well as diligent efforts by all of our employees in driving cost synergies from the business. We realized more than $350 million of annualized gross cost synergies through the end of 2017. Approximately half of that went directly back to customers on our cost-plus-type contracts, resulting in some headwinds to revenue as Roger mentioned. We invested a portion of the other half to improve our offerings and competitiveness and drive growth as well as drive improved operating margin. We generated $526 million of cash from operations in the year and prudently deployed that to three primary areas. First, we returned $198 million to shareholders through our regular quarterly dividend. And second, we reduced our debt by $209 million bringing our total net debt position at the end of the year to $2.7 billion. Of our total outstanding debt, approximately two-thirds is fixed rate and one-third is floating after adjusting for the swaps that we have in place. And third, we spent $81 million on capital expenses primarily for replacement of company infrastructure plus some late year program-related purchases that will take advantage of the immediate expensing provisions of the tax code. As mentioned earlier, we announced this morning the approval from our board for a share repurchase authorization of up to 20 million shares. Beyond the dividend, we expect to be in the market from time to time to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchase as well. We booked $10 billion of net awards in the backlog during the year for a consolidated book-to-bill of 1.0. We exited the year with $17.5 billion in backlog and a pipeline of greater than 10x our revenue run rate. $24 billion of programs in our pipeline have already been submitted for consideration by our customers. Now for some commentary specific to our fourth quarter results. Revenues of $2.5 billion in the quarter declined 2.3% compared to the prior year. We saw a direct correlation between the revenue declines on our cost-plus programs and the lower cost enabled by our integration-related cost synergy capture. While in some cases we were able to offset this impact by driving greater scope with some of our customers that benefited from these lower prices, this headwind was a key contributor to the year-over-year revenue decline. We expect these headwinds to notably diminish in 2018 due to a more stable cost structure. This in conjunction with our existing backlog, IDIQ breadth, and the $24 billion of submitted proposals on which we are awaiting decision give us confidence in our expectation for growth in 2018. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.7% came in as expected, up 26 basis points compared to the prior year driven by the impact of cost reduction activities and strong program performance. Net bookings of $2.3 billion in the quarter resulted in a book-to-bill of 0.9, the highest level that we've seen in several years for this seasonally soft quarter reflecting improved win rates across a broader array of submitted proposals. Cash flow from operations in the quarter of $164 million was better than expected, as a higher level of advance payments more than offset a higher level of DSO than anticipated ending the year at 66 days. Despite our scale, we occasionally do experience some volatility around our DSO level driven by specific customer payment activity on a small number of large programs. While the DSO level will ultimately reflect some of these timing items, we remain intensely focused on delivering cash flow from operations at or above our guided levels by optimizing the efficiency of our billings and collection processes. We reached a significant milestone in this area last month with the successful migration of the legacy IS&GS financial systems over to the Leidos accounting and billing system. We've mentioned this to you in the past as being the final systems migration planned from the transaction and instrumental in delivering the final material tranche of the remaining cost synergy target. So far, the effects of the cutover have been as expected, and we'll talk more about this shortly during my guidance remarks. The tax rate on non-GAAP net income for the quarter came in slightly lower than expected at 32.5% bringing our full year rate to just under 34%. Going forward, as indicated earlier, we will benefit from a lower rate here due to the Tax Act. Given its 2017 enactment date, we recognize the net benefit of $115 million to our fourth quarter GAAP net income, primarily resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities at the lower rate. Note that we have excluded this one-time benefit from our non-GAAP results. Partially offsetting this benefit and also excluded from non-GAAP results was an impairment charge of $33 million related to the restructuring of an outstanding promissory note receivable on assets disposed of in 2015. As in other quarters, we also exclude the impact of amortization of intangibles as well as transaction and restructuring expenses from our non-GAAP results. I'd like to now provide some highlights of our segment results in the quarter before discussing our outlook. Revenues in our Defense Solutions segment declined 4% year-over-year. This segment was the most impacted by the revenue headwind from the lower cost structure discussed earlier, as it has the highest concentration of cost-plus contracts. In addition, the quarter's results reflect the wind down of some programs from earlier in the year as well as the delay in the timing of material purchases on one program. Despite the year-over-year decline, we were able to increase non-GAAP operating margins by 130 basis points due to strong program performance and the lower indirect costs. Sequentially, we did see a 2% increase in revenues in the segment, as we begin to realize the momentum from the more recent improved win rates which also helped to drive a 1.3 book-to-bill in the quarter from the segment. Civil segment revenues were down just slightly versus the prior year period, while sequentially revenues grew approximately 2% driven by broad-based strength across our portfolio of programs. Non-GAAP operating margins increased 45 basis points from the prior year period due to continued strong program performance and lower indirect costs. Health segment revenues were essentially flat versus the prior year period, as growth in certain programs offset expected declines in others. The 5% sequential revenue decline in this segment reflects the expected reduced volume on a couple of contracts which we have discussed for some time now. This was also manifested in lower margins versus the prior year period. We expect this trend to continue throughout the next couple of quarters stabilizing in the second half of 2018. However, we are focused on offsetting this headwind through growth in other programs. Now, as we look ahead to 2018, we're already off to a solid start. We have a lean cost structure and increasingly powerful business development organization, a broad portfolio of technical capabilities and IDIQ vehicles, and over 31,000 of the most talented and committed employees in the industry. We are executing against the largest pipeline that we've had since the acquisition closed in 2016 and we're optimistic that the two-year budget agreement will allow for a more expeditious award process against this pipeline. These factors give us confidence in our view for 2018 and beyond. And with that, I'll turn now to guidance. We expect 2018 revenue in the range of $10.25 billion to $10.65 billion, reflecting a 3% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We expect the growth to be more back-end loaded, driven by the effects of the budgetary environment on the procurement process. Qualitatively, given the strength of our pipeline, our improved win rates, and the stronger budget numbers approved for the next couple of years, we expect to see our top line growth increase further in the out years. We expect 2018 adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 10.1% to 10.4% reflecting a slight uptick in investments to drive growth as we discussed earlier. Our expectation for 2018 non-GAAP earnings per share is in the range of $4.15 to $4.50 a share. Finally, cash flow from operations is expected to be at or above $675 million reflecting the net benefit of the lower tax rate, offset by an increased level of working capital required to support our revenue growth. We do expect the financial systems transition mentioned earlier to further exacerbate the seasonally low Q1 cash profile due to billing transitions with our customers. However, we do expect this effect to reverse throughout Q2 and Q3. This expected Q1 dip in our cash balance is the primary reason that we held a higher level of cash exiting the year at $390 million compared to our targeted cash level of $200 million to $300 million. A few other notes related to our guidance. First, net interest expense for 2018 is anticipated to be about $135 million. Following the enactment of the Tax Act and the revised treatment of CapEx as discussed earlier, we now expect CapEx for 2018 to be consistent with 2017 spending levels at approximately $80 million. And finally, we expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the year to be in the range of 23% to 24%. And with that, I'll stop and turn it over to Rob to take some questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. To allow as many as possible to ask questions, please ask one primary question and one follow-up question. Our first question comes from line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your questions. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yes. Thanks so much. Good quarter. So first on the bookings, this year I recall you don't have any of your top 10 contracts up for re-compete, so you should have a fairly light re-compete year, and with the bookings vigor you're seeing, are you seeing any reversal of the situation you had last year when you just \u2013 you get three to six months' extension so that we're really going to see this bow wave of potential awards come through? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Cai, by the way, thanks for the comment. That's what we're seeing and that's what we're thinking, okay? Now, where we sit today, we've got appropriations bills, but we're still facing an omnibus decision on the 23rd of March. Our assumption going forward is that we will get the specific budgets cleared up in the omnibus that will get passed on the 23rd. That will free up for the remainder of the fiscal year the acquisition and procurement process in both Defense and Civil, and we'll see a lot of programs, frankly, quite a few new starts, that have sort of been hung up in the continuous CR cycle brakeless (30:20). Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Terrific. And based on your comments about the first quarter, would it be fair to assume that we should see a book-to-bill definitely above 1 in the first quarter and hopefully for the year? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: We know \u2013 Cai, I appreciate the question and you kind of know the answer. We don't guide on it quarter-by-quarter. And let me just simply say and why I included those comments, we are pleased with what we have seen since the first of the year. We cleaned up a protest or two, which happened in 2017, frankly, in our favor and we've seen some nice awards already in January. And that's really as specific as I can be. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ed Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. It's actually Rick Eskelsen on for Ed. Question, if I can, on the revenue synergies that you've seen and expect to see from the IS&GS transaction. You've done an impressive job on the cost synergies side. And I know the revenue was always going to take longer, but what have you seen and how is that contributing to the higher win rate? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. This is Jim. Thanks for the question. The way we have defined revenue synergies in the past, and I think that the way you might recall us talking about it at Investor Day, is things that would not have shown up in the pipeline or significantly improved win rates on things that we compare to kind of the steady-state case before the acquisition. The numbers that we previewed then, we have actually done better than what that plan was. And in fact, earlier in 2017, I think that we did talk about a couple of significant contract awards that we had received in the DOD space that were not in the bid pipeline from either business. So things started popping up a little bit earlier than we expected and we're pleased with where revenue synergies have gone so far. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. And then just two numbers questions, if you can. Can you quantify what your win rates are now? You talked about them being better. Can you give us a sense of what they are? And can you also quantify how big that cost-plus revenue headwind that's going away was in 2017? Thank you. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. So we're not in the habit of disclosing what our win rates are, but we've analyzed this, as you might expect, in a whole number of different ways. And any way we've looked at it, we're very pleased with an improvement in the win rate compared to what it was at the time that we put the deal together. And that really we owe to two or three primary factors. First, the cost structure is significantly leaner than it was during the period leading up to closing the transaction. And then secondly, having some different business development processes \u2013 new business development processes and some new people involved, as you can imagine, it does take more than a couple of quarters for you to start to see the benefit of that. And now, we're seeing that in both the win rates that we're seeing as well as the size of the pipeline that we're executing against. And then, in terms of the revenue headwind, we talked about a $350 million cumulative annualized impact of cost synergies. And actually, the revenue headwind on an annual basis is a little bit over half of that $350 million. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Sure. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Noah. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, just to follow-up on that revenue impact from less cost-plus revenue from the cost synergies. The half of the $350 million, on an annualized basis, did that mostly come in the fourth quarter because I just don't remember you guys talking about that before? And then also, did I hear you correctly that there was also, as a totally separate item, just some contract timing slippage out of the fourth quarter? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: The first question, Noah, the impact on that roughly 1/2 of $350 million, that actually had been felt throughout the year. We hadn't been talking about it primarily because when we stepped back and took a look at our analysis of the year-over-year for the full year, it was clearly something we couldn't ignore and we wanted to get it to you guys. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: And Noah, of course, that headwind is completely aligned with the rate of cost savings. Because we got off the TSA agreement in October because of the great work that our CAO and Jim and his team has done on our supplier management system and our accounting system, some of those cost reduction synergy benefits did occur in the second half of 2017 as we have talked about in our call. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And was there also additionally a slippage of anything? It sounded like you're alluding to that in your prepared remarks. Just wanted to understand how big that was if that happened. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: There was a little bit. I think that when we think about \u2013 I mean, overall, I think we felt pretty good about the Q4 bookings number compared to a typical Q4. We would have expected a little bit less, but we were able to pull some things in, actually, in the last month of the quarter. So we felt pretty good about that. The other thing that's probably notable relative to bookings, one thing that was a bit of a headwind for us in the full year number is that the amount of backlog that we had to adjust because of the change in rates. Because customers were going to take the savings that we were offering them on contracts in place, it required us to take that adjustment against the gross bookings number for the year. And when we look at the gross bookings number, new contract awards, we feel pretty good about that and it gives us some good momentum going into 2018. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just last thing, Jim, on working capital, am I hearing you correctly that you're saying you \u2013 in your 2018 cash flow outlook, you're embedding a total working capital headwind year-over-year. Is that correct? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. And really, the headwind isn't DSO-focused as much it is that \u2013 with our view right now, the visibility we have in our revenue picture says that we're going to have year-over-year growth and sequential growth in the back end of the year. When you hold DSO constant, it does require you to put some of your cash into accounts receivable. And that's where that kind of headwind comes from. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Do you not have the large tailwind from the reversal of the bill that was specific to the novation process from the IS&GS integration? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: That's a great question, but we really saw that in Q3 and Q4. So if you take a look at where cash flow has been in 2017, the back end was a little bit stronger than we have previously indicated and guided, and that came from the novation process playing out. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay, thanks very much guys. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everyone. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Good morning. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Roger, could you add a little more perspective on what you mentioned in terms of the potential to accelerate growth in the out years, just give us a sense for what you might be seeing? And then how does that interact with the long-term margin target which we're already running above? I guess, at the end of the day, the question is, do you see earnings growth coming mostly from sales or margin or both going forward? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Okay. Good. A couple of great questions, and as we have tried to say in the past few calls, those things are completely intertwined, right? And you all often ask, from an investment standpoint, which would we prefer? And I think our answer has consistently been, as it was on Investor Day, is that we want to operate that business in double-digit margins and we were fortunate that we achieved that, frankly, earlier than we had predicted in August of 2016. And I think we had been actually pretty clear that once we got there, that we would try to maintain that margin rate, plus or minus quarter to quarter, but we would take funds and use it to invest in growth. And quarter-by-quarter, we'll be a little high, a little low. We want to continue, as I think I said in my prepared comments, in that low-double digit, but we want to invest in technology new business funds, capital where it's appropriate and it fuels our competitiveness in programs going forward. Coming back to sort of the budget and the tailwind that we see, our early read of the appropriations bill and what we've seen already in the 2019, if you will, skinny budgets that are out and being analyzed is, there is a nice balance between capital acquisition of our customers and improvement in solutions and services. So, on one hand, we have a customer who needs to buy platforms, ships and tanks, and airplanes, but they also have mission-capable rates and readiness and soldier welfare, for instance, that have also become important, and we actually think we benefit from both, but we're very pleased that we see additional money for the VA, for instance, which we think will allow them to move forward more aggressively on their updating of their VistA electronic healthcare records program, a program we hope to participate in with our partners. And so there's just a lot of good things for us in the way the BBA \u2013 the Bipartisan Budget Act actually came out. One last point I'll make not to get too long of an answer, but many people expected to see the increase in defense spending, but because of how the bill was actually constructed, they had to raise the budget caps on civil, government as well as defense. And so where it appeared maybe a quarter ago, it was going to be a trade between the defense part of the business and the civil part of our business, and as you all know, we're relatively balanced in our exposure to both markets. We now sit here today realizing we're going to get a top line increase on the defense side. But what maybe wasn't completely understood is because we wanted to get the sequester caps raised, that the civil side of government gets a proportionally increase in their top line as well. That's really going to help a lot of our civil agencies, FAA and organizations like that for which we have a significant business. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thanks for that comprehensive answer. I'll hop back in the queue and give some other folks the change. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks, Jon. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Krishna Sinha with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your questions. Krishna Sinha - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. So, just a quick housekeeping one. I don't know if you mentioned this in the prepared remarks, but what was the increase in corporate expense in the quarter? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: The increase \u2013 well, we had a pretty significant \u2013 I'm not sure which one you're talking about, but there was a pretty significant increase in the corporate numbers related to \u2013 we took an impairment charge on a note receivable. That was primarily because of the underlying collateral related to that has been impaired. So we needed to take that charge and that's related to some assets that we disposed of a couple of years ago. Krishna Sinha - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: That was the single biggest driver there. Krishna Sinha - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then just to elaborate on your earlier comments around the DSOs, obviously they're lumpy, so I don't expect much clarity on just individual quarters, but you have talked about an ability to reduce the DSOs by, I think, something like five to seven days to get it back down into the low 60s. Is that still the goal and can you outline a timeline for that? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. So our goal is always to continue to extract and get non-cash working capital off the balance sheet as a result of improving our billing processes, and today we've cut over to a single billing platform that we run the whole business on and it's one that our customers are very familiar with. I would say that we aspire to numbers that are significant improvements over even what we've guided to, but at this point, the number that we're guiding to is the one that we are confident as being pretty solid in terms of where DSO is going to the end of the year. The way I think that we look to be able to continue driving that better into the future is coming up and actually putting all of our major programs on singular billing processes that, as we look to how it was being done in the legacy IS&GS Business, they were really done program-by-program. They were all done differently. And we have, I think, a significant opportunity to both improve the speed at which we get bills out and therefore get them collected and also the cost at which we do those billing processes. So I think that the answer is I think that there is opportunity. It's just a question of when. Krishna Sinha - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then one final one. You talked about $24 billion in proposals awaiting decision. I guess one question there is does that include any factored VA contract or even the NGEN contract that I know you announced your team for recently? And then just a broader question. There are some sizable contract opportunities out there. It sounds like the government is consolidating contracts to have larger contracts. I know GD certainly cited that as a reason to buy CSRA. So can you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of government prioritization on making contracts larger and awarding them to larger fed IT companies such as yourself? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Let me take part of that and I'll give part of that to Jim. By the way, a lot of questions in there. First of all, is the Navy Next-Gen or the VA EHR/EMR in the $24 billion? Neither of those programs have gone to the bid stage, so they wouldn't be in what we track as our submits. They are in our pipeline. They only go too far off into pipeline discussions, but we have obviously a pipeline that we maintain of prospective bids and our pipeline number is significantly larger than the $24 billion. And then you had sort of a general question about do we see customers opting for larger companies? Are they aggregating more? First, let me say I don't think the trend is significantly different than it has been in the past and I think all customers kind of go through a cycle. If they start out and maybe go with smaller contractors, they find the administration cost of that can be expensive. We in the lifecycle of any kind of a technology with a customer at some point they do start aggregating contracts because it's simpler for them to execute. But at any \u2013 one of our customers, any one of our \u2013 those agencies within the customers, we see all kinds of behaviors. We do see some contracts being consolidated and they do look for larger firms to compete against those. But many of the customers are looking for innovation and they write smaller contracts and they could take more risk with those. And I think it's important for a company like Leidos at our size to be able to, yes indeed, compete on the large programs and have the people and the cost structure to do that, but also to invest in R&D and innovation, and to do things like watching an information assurance and artificial intelligence and machine learning, all those kind of things, they will be the large programs in the future. And our thesis is that we can provide a broader spectrum of solutions to our customers with a company the size of Leidos. And, Jim, do you want to add...? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Just the only other thing I think is worth adding to that, Krishna, is that while many contracts are getting larger, there is an increasing tendency, and we talked about this before, toward moving away from the big, full and open contracts to IDIQ-type contracts that allow the procurement process to be on the government side and quite honestly, with the contractors, more efficient. And what that means for us is that we will participate in a big IDIQ or even a single award IDIQ and then we get task orders that we add to backlog as the task orders are received rather than putting a big contract value into backlog. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Good morning. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Rob. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: So, Roger, on the back of that, consolidation was brought up. What do you make of the latest consolidation efforts in the industry and the fact that there will now be two of you roughly the same size out there? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Let's see, Rob. Not surprised, right. I think we have been pretty transparent all along that we expected further consolidation in the industry. We have always said \u2013 you say there are two of us our size, and I think we have tried to indicate \u2013 depending upon how you define the industry, there are already big players. There's AECOM and IBM and DXC. And so there's \u2013 depending upon where we're bidding, we see big companies and small companies. Our deal thesis as we put forward was there are benefits to being bigger, the investments you can make, the strength of your balance sheet, and what we view the latest consolidations is other people must believe that as well. And as I think we've said on prior calls, Rob, we don't think it's over, right. I think there's opportunity for more consolidation because of the value capture, the synergies we're able to create when you put two smaller entities together. Not to be said there won't be some very strong players who are, if you will, more nichey, who decide that being at $5 billion, for instance, is where they want to be and then that's fine with them. We look at the market differently. We made a different choice. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then, just on the \u2013 maybe this is for Jim, but on the revenue guide, looks like about 1% to 5%, depending on how things play out, what are the major swing factors there? And is that growth concentrated in one business segment or another? How do we think about it that way? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. So, Rob, we're kind of trying to avoid being in the business of guiding these kind of numbers to specific segments. I would tell you that it is broad based across all of our business segments. And there really isn't any single big contract award upon which that revenue guide sits. I think that we're confident that the number will be consistent with our guidance that's based on what our win rate trends have been and what's the size of the pipeline is against which we're executing, and the size of bids that are in evaluation with customers today. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Is it fair to say that you expect the legacy Leidos businesses to start to reaccelerate along with IS&GS, which I think was the growth engine in 2017? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Today, they're so fully integrated that we don't even analyze and think about there being a legacy Leidos win rate or a legacy Leidos book-to-bill and a legacy IS&GS book-to-bill. The systems are managed on one accounting system and one business development system, and we have stopped looking at the business that way. I do think that when \u2013 without looking at the numbers that way, I would say that the whole business is performing with the same kind of strength as opposed to thinking about it as legacy Leidos or legacy IS&GS. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Okay, thank you. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Rob. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Rob. Operator : The next question is from the line of Greg Konrad with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Greg Konrad - Jefferies LLC : Good morning. I just wanted to come at the revenue synergy question in a different way. I mean when we look at that $24 billion bid pipeline outstanding, is there any way to quantify maybe how many of those opportunities you wouldn't have been able to bid on prior versus as the merger happened that you're able to bid on today? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Not with any kind of precision to be honest with you, Greg. What we can tell you, though, is that there are things that show up when Roger and I do a bid review that we can point to as saying, okay, well, this wouldn't have been something we could be executing on had it not been for either technical capabilities that we acquired in the deal or customer intimacy that we acquired in the deal. And we're confident that the numbers are consistent with \u2013 or better than the numbers we previewed you before. Greg Konrad - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. And then just a follow-up on the cash flow number. I mean it includes $75 million cash impact of transaction and integration costs. Just to clarify, I mean, so do those costs complete in 2018? And is there kind of any update to maybe the synergy potential versus the $350 million that you said you generated in 2017? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Just to make sure that, for the benefit of clarity, the number we've previewed for 2018 does include a roughly $25 million cost relative to resolution of a matter on purchase price adjustment with Lockheed Martin and we took that to the P&L because it was outside of the one-year purchase accounting window. So, that's really 1/3 of the $75 million that you see there. There is a small amount of trailing costs that we're expecting in 2019 that is not related to systems or other integration things. It really has to do with consolidation of our real estate footprint, which is expected to end in 2019. Greg Konrad - Jefferies LLC : And just on the synergy number, I mean are any of those synergy-producing when we think about kind of the $350 million that you ended 2017 at? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Of the $50 million, they definitely are associated with producing not just the $350 million, but we've indicated that the run rate will go up to $400 million, and to close on that, we do have some remaining acquisition and synergy-related investments that we have to make. That's the $50 million that relates to closing up the systems migration, there's been a significant amount of cost in the first quarter on that, and then there's also some significant investment in severance and other similar costs. Greg Konrad - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We have time for one additional question this morning. It's coming from the line of Brian Ruttenbur with Drexel Hamilton. Brian Ruttenbur - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Yeah. Thank you very much. Just a couple of quick housekeeping questions. So IS&GS, it is done in the first half. We shouldn't see any additional charges beyond that. Is that correct? Is that what you mean? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: You mean additional charges related to the acquisition? I mean... Brian Ruttenbur - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Right. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: ...other than what we've previewed. Brian Ruttenbur - Drexel Hamilton LLC : That's right. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yes, that's correct. Brian Ruttenbur - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay. And so you're 80% done right now just as \u2013 or 90% in your opinion? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I mean when we think about the percentage of costs that we're expecting to incur relative to acquisition and integration costs, that's a fair estimate. Brian Ruttenbur - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay. And then a couple other little housekeeping. The share count that you've assumed for 2018, have you assumed any buyback in that or any of your projection in terms of interest or cash flows? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Our guidance assumes that the buyback at this point will take care of any kind of additional share issuances in connection with our employee benefit programs. Brian Ruttenbur - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay. So you basically assume just flattish going forward. So if you make a big purchase, that should be accretive to your guidance or move guidance from the lower to the higher? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: That is true. Brian Ruttenbur - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I now turn the floor back to Kelly Freeman for closing remarks. Kelly Freeman - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Rob, and thank you, all, for your participation in the call today. Have a good day. Operator : Today's conference has concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Freeman, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kelly Freeman - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Rob, and thank you, everyone. Good morning. I'd like to welcome you to our first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the Leidos management team. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter ending March 30, 2018. Roger will lead off the call with notable highlights from the quarter as well as comment on the market environment and our company's strategy. Jim will follow with a discussion of our financial performance and our guidance expectations. After these remarks from Roger and Jim, we'll open the call for your questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, during the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in the press release that we issued this morning and is also available in the presentation slide. The press release and the presentation as well as the supplementary financial information file are provided on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.leidos.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone. Roger? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Kelly, and thank you all for joining us this morning for our first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Our first quarter results demonstrate a strong start to the year with notable performance in bookings, profitability and cash generation. Our book-to-bill ratio of 1.02 in the quarter is the highest level for our first quarter since our corporate split back in 2013. We realized $2.5 billion in net bookings, exiting Q1 with a balance of $17.6 billion in total backlog, over $700 million above the prior year period. Win rates continued their upward trajectory across all types of program awards; re-competes, new business and competitive takeaways. These results demonstrate a good return on the investments we have made in our business development, people and processes. While we see opportunities for further investments in driving new wins, we are simultaneously focused on increasing the value realized from our existing contracts awards and IDIQ vehicles. Bookings in the quarter also reflect strong performance in this area with notable contribution from on-contract growth as our program and account managers work with our customers to deliver value to their missions through additional scope on existing contracts. Strong program performance in the quarter was another highlight and reflects a notable theme that ran through all of our segments. Our track record in this area continues as evidenced by the sequential and year-over-year improvements in adjusted EBITDA margins. As our customers are faced with organizational changes, program transitions and shifting priorities, their ability to rely on Leidos to meet and exceed our commitments has earned us high program award fees. Cash generation in the quarter considerably outperformed our expectations and marked the first time in five years that we have seen positive cash flow from operations in Q1. This positive cash largely reflects a higher than expected level of advance payments, offsetting the typical Q1 cash flow items and the working capital build due to the financial systems transition during the quarter. We took advantage of this higher than expected level of cash flow to commence share repurchases in the quarter. We expect to continue to participate in the market from time-to-time to repurchase shares of our stock at a minimum to offset share accrete. During the quarter, we also successfully completed the financial systems transition, which was the last notable milestone in our integration and cost synergy plan. The conclusion of that activity allowed us to successfully achieve our cost synergy goals for the IS&GS transaction of more than $400 million. This is a result of hard work and difficult decisions by every department in the company. We're proud of what we have accomplished and the more efficient and flexible cost structure which we can offer \u2013 with which we can offer innovative solutions to our customers. Q1 also yielded positive developments in the macro environment. The government fiscal year 2018 funding was finalized in the Omnibus agreement signed into law by March 23. This agreement includes increases for both defense and non-defense agencies. The upward climb in defense budgets which began in fiscal 2017 are set to accelerate with the two-year agreements for fiscal 2018 and 2019, which adds $80 billion and $84 billion, respectively over the sequester caps. Given the lateness of the completion of the funding cycle for fiscal 2018, the Pentagon does have some end-of-the-year flexibility to spend these increases, which is encouraging. The domestic discretionary budget for fiscal 2018 is up almost 9%, a dramatic swing from the administration's initial request of a $54 billion decrease. The combined defense and domestic discretionary increases for fiscal 2018 and 2019 total $296 billion. The improved certainty in the budget authority and spending levels has also we believe driven early signs of more longer duration program awards from our customers, a welcomed reversal of many successive quarters of declining duration in our backlog. In addition to the higher budget authority, we are also encouraged by increased level of awareness and desire to streamline and accelerate the procurement processes, particularly within the Pentagon. Overall, we are off to a good start for the year and we are pleased with the positive early indicators of our future growth. Our industry-leading scale, cost structure, talented people and innovative capabilities are competitive differentiators and we have been able to leverage these to improve our win rates and drive increases to our backlog. My team and I remain committed to focusing on growth, profitability and cash generation to deliver value to our customers and employees and return capital to our shareholders. Before I conclude, I'd like to mention that we have recently finalized the date for our next Investor Day, which we plan to hold in September. We look forward to sharing further details with you regarding our strategy and our position in key markets at this event. More details will be provided closer to the date. With that, let me hand the call over to Jim Reagan, Leidos' Chief Financial Officer, for more details on the quarter and our outlook. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Roger, and thanks to everyone who are joining us on the call today. Overall, we are pleased with the bookings, profitability and positive cash from operations in the quarter. As we've previously indicated, we are intensely focused on driving growth throughout the business, while maintaining adjusted EBITDA margins at or above 10%. To that end, I'll start by sharing some bookings commentary before providing additional context to our financials. As Roger mentioned, during the quarter, we realized $2.5 billion in net bookings, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02. Following the increased budget certainty, we're encouraged that awards in the quarter reflected longer duration periods of performance, enabling an increase in our average backlog duration after several quarters of declines. Bookings in our Defense Solutions segment drove much of the net increase, more than doubling from the prior year period. We generated over $1.6 billion in new bookings in the quarter in Defense Solutions, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.4x, the highest book-to-bill in this segment since we closed the IS&GS transaction. The awards were driven by a relatively broad set of customers and types of work, but contract awards from our classified customers were a notable highlight. We were awarded $1.3 billion of work by our national security and intelligence clients to perform mission critical services that help to counter global threats and strengthen national security. Bookings in our Civil and Health segments were in line with the prior year levels, reflecting wins with the FAA, Department of Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs and the Department of Health and Human Services along with many others. Now, moving to the P&L, starting at the top, consolidated revenue in the quarter declined 5% from the prior year. Roughly $60 million of the $137 million year-over-year decline was driven by timing of revenue recognition on certain programs, which delays revenue recognition into later in the year. While this disproportionately affects the first quarter comparison, we do expect to recover these revenues throughout the rest of the year. And as I'll mention in my discussion on cash flow, in certain cases where revenue is now delayed until later in the year, the customer has already paid us for these orders. Excluding this impact, revenues declined about 3% from the prior year quarter, reflecting program wind downs from prior year losses as well as a lower level of volumes on several other programs, notably in our Defense Solutions segment. Despite the lower revenues, adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter increased by 20 basis points from the prior year to 10.2%, the result of considerable focus by our groups on delivering strong program performance, which resulted in a higher level of program fees as well as a higher proportion of Leidos direct labor on contracts. Net interest expense of $34 million was largely in line with expectations. During the quarter, we made further progress in continuing to reduce the cost of capital. We again successfully re-priced our Term Loan B facilities, reducing interest rates on the $1.1 billion portion of our outstanding debt by 25 basis points. We also entered into additional swap agreements, moving $250 million of our floating debt to fixed, bringing our total exposure now to about 70% fixed, 30% floating. We are comfortable with this mix, but we'll continue to monitor developments on the yield curve to ensure that we're operating at the optimal cost of capital for our organization. Given this mix, a 100-basis point incremental move in LIBOR would result in an approximately $7 million to $8 million of additional annual interest expense. Non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.03 reflects the strong margin performance discussed earlier as well as a slightly lower than expected effective tax rate across a fully diluted share count of 154 million shares, flat from the prior quarter. Note that we did resume share repurchase activity during the first quarter and expect to continue to be in the market from time to time in order to hold our share count flat at a minimum. Cash flow from operations was unseasonably strong in the first quarter, largely reflecting advance payments from customers for materials procured for certain contracts, which, as I mentioned earlier, are expected to generate revenue later this year. This more than offset the use of cash resulting from the financial systems migration implemented during the quarter. Now that migration was completed on plan and on budget. While the migration resulted in the expected temporarily elevated level of DSOs ending Q1 at 71 days, we do expect a return to a more normalized invoicing and billing process in the second and third quarters and a commensurate higher level of cash generation resulting from the associated DSO reduction. The successful conclusion of the financial systems migration represented the final material element of our integration activity plan. And the savings generated by this enabled us to attain our gross cost synergy goal, which as Roger highlighted, was more than $400 million, driven by the combination of the two businesses. Despite the achievement of our transaction related cost synergy targets, we will continue to focus on ensuring an optimal and lean cost structure, including executing some of the real estate consolidation driven by the deal. Now that said, having achieved our cost synergy target and given the level of materiality we expect from the remaining real estate related activities, after this report, we will cease to provide further updates against the cost synergy targets from the IS&GS transaction. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents balance of $215 million, down from the prior quarter level due primarily to two items. First, a $105 million cash outflow due to the resolution of an outstanding deal related item with Lockheed Martin disclosed on our last call. $81 million of this $105 million is included as an investing cash outflow with the balance reported as an operating cash outflow. Second, financing activities drove an outflow of $91 million due to typical Q1 items; dividend payments, debt payments, and as referenced earlier, share repurchase activity. We expect Q1 to be the low watermark on the cash balance as is typically the case. We remain committed to our capital deployment philosophy, which balances investing for growth, regular quarterly dividends, debt paydown and share repurchases to enable an optimal cost of capital while also driving increased value for our shareholders. Now, let me share some color on our segment results. In our Defense Solutions segment, revenue was down 9% in the quarter, a disappointing number that reflects two key items. First, this segment was more significantly impacted than any other by revenue recognition timing items discussed earlier. Specifically, $50 million of the $116 million year-over-year decline in revenues was due to timing of revenue recognition on certain pass-through costs. This is purely a timing item and we expect to recognize the revenue from this aspect of the contract over the course of the next three quarters of 2018. Second, the remainder of the decline was driven by a combination of lower volumes on some programs and wind-down of other programs as prior year award decisions now become fully reflected in revenue. As we discussed on prior calls, following a review of those losses from 2016 and early 2017, we made changes to our business development organization and processes. Those changes have already begun to pay dividends for us and improved win rates as mentioned earlier. Non-GAAP operating margins in the Defense segment improved by over 130 basis points from the prior year quarter due to a continued focus on delivering exceptional program performance, which generated a higher level of program fees. In our Civil segment, non-GAAP operating margins also improved by more than 130 basis points on flat revenues over the prior year, reflecting profit write-ups due to strong program performance as well as improved profitability in our international business. Health segment revenue and profitability declined year-over-year. However, the magnitude has been less than expected. Relative to the prior quarter, non-GAAP operating margins in our Health segment increased 50 basis points despite the flat revenue, as our team has done a good job of getting in front of customers, performing well on their programs and driving customer awareness of the value of the Leidos commitment and technical solutions. This helps drive a higher level of program fees awarded by our customers, resulting in increased profitability in the quarter. Across our organization, our teams remain focused on executing well on all of our programs while helping our customers navigate the changing landscape of their priorities and challenges. With that, I'll move on to our 2018 guidance, which remains unchanged relative to our prior view with revenue in the expected range of $10.25 billion to $10.65 billion, adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 10.1% to 10. 4%, non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.15 to $4.50 per share, and cash flow from operations at or above $675 million. In conclusion, we are pleased with the strength in our bookings and financials in the first quarter and remain confident that we are well-positioned to drive growth in the business and to achieve our targets. Rob, with that, let's now open it up to take questions. Operator : Thank you. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everyone. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hey, good morning, Jon. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Jon. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Roger and Jim, last year around this time you talked about some surprises and you referenced on your prepared remarks that you made some changes to counter those surprises. But you also mentioned that defense is maybe a bit disappointing in the quarter. So, can you give us a sense for what drove \u2013 what's behind the disappointments and how will you improve from here? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, I think last year about this time, we had lost a couple of programs that we kind of \u2013 we viewed as part of our base going forward and a little bit of the decline in revenue that we realized in the first quarter is really the tail of that. And the disappointment was in pulling the two companies together and focusing on synergies, in getting the teams pulled together, we had to assess whether we had spent the right amount of time external as we had spent internal. And so, over the last year, we've really worked hard with our business development organization and our customer facing, we call them strategic account executives in our Washington office, to spend a lot more time out of the office and with the customer. And we're really pleased in the quarter that we can point to some of our numbers now that show a return to growth and a book-to-bill over 1. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then, just give us a sense, I mean, your guidance for the year implies, I think, still 1% to 5% year-on year-growth. The first quarter is down a bit. How should we think about the trajectory through year end in terms of hitting that growth? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, Jon, great question. Obviously, you can do the math. We reaffirmed our guidance. So, obviously, we still feel very positive about the year. And so, you've got one quarter in the books and we don't guide on a quarter-by-quarter basis as you know, but you can kind of do the math. And we've always hinted that this year would start slower because of some of the disappointments we had 12 months ago. But, all of the signs, our performance, our award fee scores, our book-to-bill, and frankly all the external factors relative to the Omnibus for the federal government what we see in both defense and non-defense, gives us confidence that our guidance is rock solid and we feel really good about the prospects for the year. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, Roger. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your questions. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yes, thank you very much. So, in the first quarter when we were under a CR, you delivered a very respectable book-to-bill. And, Roger, you mentioned how strong the FY budget is, both on the Defense side and Civil better than expected. So, I would assume we're going to see book-to-bill pick up. Maybe give us some color on what you've seen since the budget got appropriated and maybe some sense as to where the book-to-bill for the year could be. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Cai. Great question. I hope my forecasting ability is actually that good. But what we have seen since the Omnibus is a significant number of awards and frankly, some that came in after the quarter, we announced that we won a program with the Army Corps. Now, we'll see if that gets protested. We won a couple of other significant programs in the first quarter and then after. Of course, some of those get protested in, so we can't put those in the backlog. But we've seen, if you will, the logjam of significant awards and I'm talking three-digit millions finally get awarded and we're hoping that that pace will continue. I see no reason why it won't in the conversations that we have with customers and these things that have been in evaluation and in the process for months, sometimes much longer than months, are now starting to get awarded and we feel good that we will get our appropriate share of those. So, what we've said is that book-to-bill will again be north of 1 and in order to make the numbers work of course with the revenue guidance that we have out there that we have to book higher than 1 for the full year. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Is it expected that given you did so well in this first quarter under a CR that you might be at something like 1.1 for the year? Maybe give us a range or a guess if you could as to where you see the book-to-bill? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, Cai, I appreciate the question and we don't guide book-to-bill. As you know, we guide on revenue. We'd come back and reconfirmed our revenue number and you've got our book-to-bill and you kind of know what's in backlog, which is up, which is really a significant thing for us to have backlog up and you'll have to do the math on your own, but I understand your logic and it seems pointing in the right direction to me. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thank you very much. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, everyone. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hey, good morning, Noah. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: If I'm doing the math correctly, you'd have to grow 8% organically on the top line the remainder of the year to come in at the high end of the revenue range. Is that in the scenario analysis here? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: This is Jim. Noah, your math is right. And given where we see bids in evaluation today and the expected timing of those awards, we are still very confident that we will be in that range. We're already seeing a significant pickup in our hiring and in some cases, we have some confidence to hire ahead of certain kinds of awards and certain task orders that we're expecting under IDIQs that are already awarded. So, that combined with \u2013 last year, we saw some significant on-contract growth and we are still seeing robust \u2013 we call it OCG, robust OCG going into the second quarter which further gives us confidence of our ability to hit those kind of rates. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: On the bookings and the wins and where backlog is coming in, I always thought I should be more focused on the funded backlog, especially when predicting a three \u2013 the next three quarters or remaining three quarters of a year or certainly the next 12 months and the funded backlog is down a couple of hundred million bucks in the quarter. Why should I not be looking at that maybe even a little concerned with that versus the total backlog? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Noah, in our business, some large contract vehicles or large contracts are funded in relatively small increments and I think of some of the work that we do in Health. But we focus in terms of how we run staffing, how we run our internal forecasting and planning more based on what the size of the contracts are. We obviously have to worry about funding to make sure that we get paid on time, but we don't look as much as the funding levels because of some of the vagaries on some of our larger contracts. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, Noah, I would add to that, unlike maybe a company that builds airplanes and is doing advance procurement, our customers are pretty reliable on spending the contract value. And then the funded versus unfunded and of course the accounts have made our life complicated now. There is a third term in our financials, which is a GAAP definition. And I think you see this across our competitors as well. The unfunded number is perhaps a more reliable indicator of future growth than unfunded would be for a company that was hardware-oriented. And that's why there's more program and funding issues within agencies as to what actually gets in the current claim versus the next claim. And we've got one program with a three-digit agency that the contract value is almost $1 billion and the first claim was only $60 million. And so, we would have put $60 million in funded. But we know, in fact, we hope on that program that it will eventually be larger than $1 billion. And by the way, we're always happy to talk about that to help you give you insight as to what's in the funded part versus the unfunded. And that's why you see us emphasize the total number rather than just the funded. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's really helpful. If I could just sneak one more in on free cash, Jim, I was hoping you might be able to tell me for each of kind of the major movers in working capital, which I would think are inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable. For each of those, are they a source of cash or a use of cash in your free cash flow guidance for the year? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: In free cash flow guidance, I'll start with accounts payable. That will become a source of cash. The number for accounts receivable will become a source of cash. And then, for inventory, it should be fairly neutral. That's a little bit harder to predict mainly because of the inventory that today I know we're buying for a major customer program that's outside of the United States and these relate to spare parts and those kinds of things, and where those inventory balances really are more dictated by the customer than by my ability to forecast it. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Have you been able to kind of level load or reset yourself on where you think long-term DSOs should go? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, our goal is to \u2013 now that we are on for 90-plus percent of the business on one accounting and billing system to be able to use that to leverage some more consistent processes to drive more ambitious DSO goals into the third and fourth quarter of this year and even beyond. And in my view, ambitious is in the low-60s or high-50s. And today, when we tell you that we're at 71 at the end of the first quarter, I am absolutely certain that that number is there simply because we've had some anticipated disruption from moving to that single system that we want to run the business line. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's really helpful. Thanks so much. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Krishna Sinha with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your questions. Krishna Sinha - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thanks. Just to follow up on that cash flow question. Can you size \u2013 I don't know if I missed this in the remarks, but can you size the amount that you got in advance payment in the first quarter? And then also, what was the incremental build in the working capital from the transition of the billing systems? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, we didn't guide anything in \u2013 we don't guide the cash flow by quarter. We guide it by year. I would tell you that it was roughly $130 million of cash that came in, in advance of when we expected internally, which drove the first quarter in several years of positive Q1 cash flow. If you go back and look at our history, Q1 is typically a negative cash flow quarter primarily because of a lot of front-loaded benefit payments and bonus payments that occur once a year, et cetera, plus, the fact that, historically, our customers tend to accelerate payments at the very end of the calendar year. We had a good \u2013 a remarkably good cash flow quarter, driven mostly by those advance payments. Through Q2, Q3, Q4, we should start to harvest the benefits of improved billing processes and billing systems and end up at roughly \u2013 I would be disappointed if we didn't drive DSO well under, say, 68 days by the end of the year. Krishna Sinha - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then on GENESIS, one, what's your expectation on installations for the rest of the year? And then, two, if I just look at GENESIS overall through the 2022 period, it seems like the growth on that is enough to push your complete growth or your company growth above the 3% range or the 3% CAGR that you've guided to. So, I'm just trying to get a sense for if there are other moving pieces besides GENESIS that would be a big headwind that would push you down to the 3% bogey? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Krishna, let me talk a little bit about the GENESIS program and I'll let Jim maybe follow up with some of the numbers. So, we are fully deployed at the IOC sites, which we did essentially on time. We are now doing our lessons learned on those IOC sites, meeting with customers. In fact, Jon Scholl and I were there just a couple of weeks ago and meeting with the commander at Madigan about what went well and what lessons we need to learn for future deployments. Our customer determines what we're going to do next and they are contemplating where we start the first wave, which we expect to happen this year, but we'll go through the process of installing it. And when we actually hit full operational capability, whether that is an 2018 event or a 2019 event, will depend upon which site they pick to go first and how fast we implement, but very pleased with the program. It's on track, fully supported by the customer. And probably the news in the quarter was the customer's decision in conjunction with the Coast Guard to add the Coast Guard to the program. And so over the long-term period, the program is essentially a 10-year-plus program, that will increase the size of the program and the number of deployments that we have. And not a huge increase in the program because we're just adding on another set of users, continues to solidify the importance of that program to our customer and to us. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. And just to pile on a little bit, Krishna. The deployment decision and the pace of that, we're expecting to learn that, as Roger indicated, from the customer sometime, hopefully, late this quarter. Our expectation for Q3 and Q4 that's kind of embedded in our Q1 results and our full year guidance, it does include we think a reasonable expectation on what that revenue uptick's going to be. But just keep in mind, in the past, as we've said, the real peak of that ramp isn't going to occur until sometime in 2019 and it could be even the latter half of 2019. Remember, full deployment of the system isn't expected to happen until 2022. So, the real acceleration we are seeing in 2019. Krishna Sinha - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then just I guess a follow-up on that. The VA contracts, obviously a lot of headlines on that. But a part of the impetus for getting that signed was that it was going to generate some cost synergy for the customer to deploy them, to deploy GENESIS and the VA simultaneously. If the VA continues to slip to the right, which it sounds like it's going to, does that then increase the amount of the eventual contract that they're going to have to spend because the customer won't get those synergies? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, first, it is likely that the VA will contract directly with Cerner. And so, it's not \u2013 it's really not our program. But we are fully supportive of the VA and Cerner and we will do whatever we can to make that program successful and look forward to the opportunity. Your specific question, I mean if it takes a few more months, six months, to get it under contract, I don't think that's going to diminish the value of the VA's decision to purchase essentially the same system that we are deploying under the Defense Health program. And in fact I would guess is it could actually extend months or maybe a year before you start to see any white space between the two programs. And again, as we've always said, we will do everything we can directly with Cerner or the VA or things that we're contractually allowed to do under the Defense Health program to make that program successful and to allow both agencies to reap the benefits of picking essentially the same electronic health care records system. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ed Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. I guess, I'm trying to understand the comfort level within the revenue range. I heard timing issues and so forth. But presumably some of that would have been known three months ago. So, has your confidence changed within where you might fall on the range relative to three months ago? Give us some help on that front. Thanks. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thanks for your question, Ed. We were aware three months ago that our Q1 revenue was going to have an element of it that pushes into the back end of the year. But that has no impact on the guidance and how we thought about guidance for the full year because we guide on a full year, not on a quarterly basis. So, our reiterating our guidance today is really rooted in what we see in pending award decisions, what we see in what was a pretty strong book-to-bill in Q1 and particularly a strong book-to-bill in the Defense segment where as we've indicated, we've spent some time tweaking and changing our people and our processes in how we go about winning new work. I think in the call last quarter, we indicated that we've seen gradually improving win rates and that holds true even into the most recent quarter. And when you combine gradually improving win rates with a larger pipeline and a larger throughput, it does give you that confidence in your forward growth outlook. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Just so I'm clear, so you're as comfortable as you were three months ago? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely, at least as comfortable. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. And, Ed, thanks for joining us. And I would reiterate that as well, especially in the macro world as where we were at the year-end, it would have been hard to predict that the Omnibus and the sequester caps and that the macro environment would be as favorable as it has been. And in our discussions, we've always talked about this year having a ramp to it. And in any given quarter, as we have said in other quarters, there are always pluses and minuses. And we got the advance payments from the materials, but we can't put those materials if materials will be booked as we pull them into inventory in the future quarters. And so, we feel very good about our guidance. And, Ed, as you know, we very rarely touch guidance in the first quarter. It's just not what we do. So, we're confident with where we are and looking forward to the next couple of quarters. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. My other question is on sort of the procurement officer behavior. Given this enormous wall of decision-making and contract deployment they face, are they backing off on squeezing hard on pricing and margins? Are you seeing any of that or is it \u2013 has that sort of intensity continued? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Let's see. We always hate to generalize. I mean we have defense customers, intel customers, civil customers, and then we've got a significant amount of our business which is international. I think I would not change the characterization of the procurement professionals that we deal with. They are trying to get value for their customers. Even though they've seen increases, frankly their mission has increased. The world is a complicated and sometimes dangerous place and they are trying to buy more with less as they have for the past few years and no, I wouldn't say that I have seen a change in their behavior at the negotiating table, whether it'd be on fees or payment profiles or things like that. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Greg Konrad with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Greg Konrad - Jefferies LLC : Good morning. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Good morning. Greg Konrad - Jefferies LLC : In the past, you've quantified a bid pipeline. I'm sorry if I missed it, but any color around the current bid pipeline? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: I'm sorry. The question again, Greg? Greg Konrad - Jefferies LLC : In the past, you've talked about a bid pipeline of \u2013 I think it's been $24 billion in the past. Any update on kind of what you're seeing in terms of opportunities? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. As we book more work, we're adding back into the pipeline. The pipeline is consistent with what we've seen before and in fact, the thing that we are liking about what we're seeing is that the average duration of the things that are both coming into the pipeline and coming out is longer. In the past, it's been characterized a little bit more by extensions and bridge contracts. And now, the customers tend to be getting back more into a cadence of more multiyear awards than we have been seeing prior to the current quarter. So, again, that really speaks to the quality of what we're getting. Greg Konrad - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. And then you mentioned the strong book-to-bill in Defense in the quarter and then starting to see the logjam clear since you had the Omnibus funding bill. I mean have you seen a difference in behavior when we look at DoD and defense versus some of the civil agencies? I mean should we think that the civil agencies will pick up or have both started to clear the logjam? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: I don't want to over characterize civil versus defense because you always have to go procurement professional by procurement professional. But if I would generalize for just a moment, I would say that the Pentagon has a more mature process for moving money quickly. And for many agencies, especially those in civil, the Omnibus \u2013 results from the Omnibus was a bit unplanned. So, from Secretary Shanahan, he was hoping for this. He had done a lot of preplanning work. And so I think the Department of Defense and the intel agencies are going to spend faster. Some of the civil agencies, who look at the skinny budget with a decrease, now end up with a surplus. And so, they had perhaps not as much advanced planning to spend that money quickly. Also, they may not have the luxury, and again it's program by program, to create sort of two-year money out of one-year money at the end of the year. So, I would expect spending in the Department of Defense to pick up faster, again, if we had to generalize civil versus defense. Greg Konrad - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. And then just last one from me. I mean, last quarter you called out lower volumes from the synergy savings and pass-through on cost plus. I mean, was that part of the year-over-year comp, when we just think about some of those synergies coming through a year ago, I mean was that a headwind in defense? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: The amount of that headwind is not nearly the level it was a year ago simply because the year-over-year run rate of cost synergies hasn't changed as much as it did a year ago this time. Greg Konrad - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Greg. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions. Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for the time. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, good morning, Joe. Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning. Just two questions. One for I think Roger and one for Jim. For Jim, maybe if you can just help us with which fiscal year you're seeing your current opportunities funded out of, just given some of the choppiness in the budget and the challenges in getting money on contract? Can you just help us base line what fiscal year your current business opportunities are being funded from, so we can get a sense for kind of what sort of budget upside is still on the comp? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, I think Roger alluded in answering the last question that given the timing at which the Omnibus was passed, there is \u2013 a lot of our customers are going to have some flexibility on when to get the current FY 2018 money on contract. That will be helpful to us and really our peers. So, there will be a lot of it that's coming out of \u2013 a lot of current year awards coming out of FY 2018 money obviously. But I think that we're going to see a little bit greater tendencies than we have in the past toward multiyear awards. Obviously, there will be some follow-on work in this year's bookings that will be coming out of FY 2019 and FY 2020 money. Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Yes. Thank you. And, Roger, for you, I think there's been a little bit of chatter particularly at the PSG conference that the OMB may be throttling back some of the budget increases and not dispersing money to the agencies. The OMB has said, just because it's budgeted doesn't mean we need to spend it. I think there are some questions as to the legality of that. But can you just talk about whether you're seeing any impact from that? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Let's see. First, we read the same trade journals that you do. I can't tell you that at the program level we actually can tell. We have any real evidence that that is happening. And then on the legality of what OMB can do and what they can't do, I am lucky enough to be able to read our financials much less giving you an opinion on what OMB's authority is. But listen, I think there's just huge requirements for us to modernize our infrastructure and this is a great opportunity for all the agencies to catch up on spending, which I believe the federal government underspent over the past five years. And so, I think in an environment like this, all OMB is trying to do is to make sure people spend the money in a smart way and they buy things that are going to make a long-term difference. And I think they're trying to be fiscally responsible and not buy a lot of spare parts, if they don't actually need simply to use up the budget authority. But from our standpoint and I can't think of a program where we seem to be affected by kind of a funding allocation veto being done by OMB. Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tobey Sommer with SunTrust Bank. Please proceed with your questions. Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Could you quantify what you mean in your prepared remarks about the duration of contracts kind of reversing and starting to inch longer? And maybe give us a sense for how you see that in your submitted bids as well as the pipeline of opportunities you're looking at. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Tobey. In the past, a lot of the bids we were submitting and being awarded tended to be \u2013 particularly as it relates to on-contract growth, tended to be extensions. Because a lot of our procurement authorities that we deal with, instead of doing five-year awards, they weren't quite ready to do a major procurement, so they would give us an extension. And typically, those could range from six months to 12 months. And that was the significant weighing factor. And even beyond that, because we are seeing and have been seeing an increasing use of IDIQ vehicles and GWACs, those typically are situations where a lot of task orders are single year, some of them are multiyear awards, but there had been a definite tendency towards shorter periods. In the past quarter, though, we have been seeing the average duration go as much as \u2013 well, on average, almost six months longer than the awards we have been getting last year. So, that is actually helping to \u2013 and we do this analysis regularly. The average length of contracts that sit in backlog is now growing as opposed to shrinking. And that gives us better visibility into our revenue numbers for the year. Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. That's helpful. And how does that improve visibility? How does it translate into changes and the way you look at the business? Trying to look at what sort of financial implications that has for you, not only the six months that you commented on, but perhaps further increases in duration? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, in the first place that it helps us is in business development. When contracts have longer duration, you're going back to the well less frequently and you're actually able to spend then proposal dollars on things that you realize over a longer period of time. So, it makes for \u2013 and by the way, it's also helpful for our customers. So, I think everyone benefits when the customer is able to think longer-term in how it buys. And that's what we're seeing in the RFPs that are coming out and the things that we're bidding on. Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : Next question is from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your questions. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much for taking the follow-up. Roger, you flagged that you had good margin in the quarter despite somewhat lower volume. So, just how do we think about the interaction between growth and margin going through year end? Essentially, can margin improve with volume pickup or is the mix going to kind of go against you through the rest of the year? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I think we've talked about this in prior quarters where we've talked about growth and new programs. And Jon, I'm sure you've been on other calls in the quarter and seen some of our competitors who have had some significant growth. But perhaps that growth has come at \u2013 to the extent or at the extent of margins. It's typical in the lifecycle of a contract. When we bid it, we don't know much about our performance. We're more conservative. We don't earn as much. But then over time, our margin tends to increase. And if we had a major re-competes, which fortunately we don't really have a lot this year, but if we did, usually, what happens in that re-compete is you bid at lower margin and then you perform. You get your award fees up. You're conservative in your bookings, but your margin increases over time. We have guided to a margin number that obviously we feel very comfortable with. Once again, I'm here talking to you all, saying I'm a little bit ahead on margin performance, which is a good thing, but we're not changing our guidance on margin performance for the year and we know we've got some growth to deliver. And so, you don't have to conclude from that what you will, but we're also not, if you will, lowering our margin performance. And simply, we've reaffirmed the guidance that we have out there, which is we think we can maintain that 10.1% to 10.4% and still hit our overall revenue numbers. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. And I'll add one thing onto that, Jon, and that is that when you think about achieving over $400 million of run rate cost synergies, what we've said previously is that even though there is a significant amount that we give back to our customers, of the piece that we keep, we're reinvesting a part of that in our ability to grow the business. We're investing it in marketing and bid proposal activity, which has \u2013 the amount of submits that we have this year has picked up and we need more money to prosecute that work. And that's also a part of how we're thinking about the current year. But we're able to do that and maintain the margins that we're looking at. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much. Operator : The next question is from the line of Brian Ruttenbur with Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed with your questions. Brian Ruttenbur - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Yeah. So, a couple just quick housekeeping. I know we got to wrap up. Taxes for the rest of the year, you did 18% in the first quarter. And then just talk about how that's going to shake out for the rest of the year. And then, you just addressed this, but SG&A and gross margin, the mix is a little bit different than historical and I know that things get in different buckets. But we should be relatively consistent on that mix going forward percentage-wise, like your gross margins were 14.6%, SG&A was 7.3% in the first quarter. That rough mix going forward in buckets should be the same for the rest of the year? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I'll answer your \u2013 Brian, your last question first. The mix should stay relatively the same. One reason you see it is having changed from what it looked like last year is that effective of January of this year, we did, in effect, a re-architecture of how we do our cost accounting in our government disclosure statements and so we bucketed some things. And our practice is to display them in our press releases and 10-Qs, consistent with how we account for them with the government regulators. Relative to taxes, you're speaking of the GAAP tax rate. We normally think \u2013 when we guide and talk about it, we talk about a non-GAAP tax rate on the things that exclude those intangible amortization and the costs of implementing our business combination plan. Our view of the tax rate at roughly 22.5% hasn't changed. We had a slightly lower than expected tax rate in Q1. But for the full year, we're still looking at somewhere between 23% and 24%. Brian Ruttenbur - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Thank you. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : The next question will be coming from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please proceed with your questions. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yes, thanks so much. While you kept your revenue estimate, if we look at the first quarter beyond the $60 million of timing, it looked like there was a comparable shortfall in terms of revenues. On the other hand, you talked about a better forward-look bookings environment. Was your single point revenue guess at the end or today, is it where it was when you first formulated guidance? I'm not asking you to tell me what it is, but is it exactly the same? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yes. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Cai, what I would tell you is to amplify on Roger's succinct answer. Yeah, there isn't anything different in how we think about the business. What we've tried to give you some visibility on is what drove the deltas that were consistent with how we planned the year. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thank you very much. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you. Maybe a last one. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question- and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Kelly Freeman for closing remarks. Kelly Freeman - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Rob. And thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning and for your interest in Leidos. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Brian Ruttenbur - Drexel Hamilton LLC Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Leidos Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Results. At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode and a brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kelly Hernandez, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kelly P. Hernandez - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the Leidos management team. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter ending June 29, 2018. Roger will lead off the call with notable highlights from the quarter as well as comments on the market environment and our company's strategy. Jim will follow with a discussion of our financial performance and our guidance expectations. After these remarks from Roger and Jim, we'll open the call for your questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, during the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in the press release that we issued this morning and is also available in the presentation slides. The press release and presentation, as well as the supplementary financial information file are provided on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.leidos.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Kelly, and thank you all for joining us this morning for our second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. We're pleased with our financial and operating results in the second quarter. Overall, we delivered strong numbers across the board including bookings, revenue, earnings per share, margins and cash flow from operations. And I'd like to go over a few highlights in these areas. First, revenue grew 3.5% sequentially. This marks the largest sequential revenue growth we have seen since our acquisition of the IS&GS Business from Lockheed Martin in 2016. While still down year-over-year as we expected, revenue is trending nicely from the contributions of new program ramps which we expect will further accelerate throughout the year. A couple of the more significant programs contributing to our sequential revenue growth include our team's work for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency under the Information Technology Enterprise Management User Facing Services or NGA ITEMS UFS program; and our efforts in support of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers-Information Technology or ACE-IT program, and also several of our classified programs. Next and looking at our increased margins during the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased sequentially to 10.9%, roughly 70 basis points higher than last quarter. This increase reflects careful management of our business growth to ensure that we win and execute on programs that allow us to grow our revenue, while sustaining strong adjusted EBITDA margins at or above our 10% long-term target. Clearly, there's always a trade-off between growth and margin, but we remain committed to thoughtfully balance these to deliver on our long-term revenue growth and margin targets. For bookings in the quarter, we saw continued improvements in our win rates. We booked $3.4 billion of net awards into backlog in the quarter for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4. Exiting the quarter, our backlog was up to $18.3 billion. Some of the more significant awards included a $365 million program with the Department of Energy to provide research and engineering services to the National Energy Technology Laboratory and a $472 million contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs to continue support of the VA's information infrastructure modernization efforts through data center consolidation and cloud computing services. Additionally, we continue to focus on expanding our relationships across the intelligence community. In particular, we have seen strong growth in our NGA account. Finally, we recently signed a subcontracting relationship with Cerner to assist in their implementation of the EHR modernization program for the VA. Our scope of work on the program will include roles in the program management office, deployment implementation, helpdesk sustainment, and security. Due to the structure of the contract, we don't expect a significant one-time booking, rather a varied level of bookings reflecting our level of activity over the course of the program. We're proud of our role in the program and the continued strength of our relationship with Cerner in enabling improved healthcare for our active duty and veteran service members and their families. We had another quarter of robust cash generation with $271 million in operating cash flow, keeping us well on track to meet our guidance. Cash flow from operations in the quarter reflects a notable reduction in DSOs in the period, something that Jim will discuss in his remarks in a moment. During the quarter, we entered into an agreement with Capgemini to sell our commercial cybersecurity business. Our decision to transition the Leidos commercial cybersecurity business to Capgemini is the result of our deliberate strategic focus on providing services and solutions, including cyber, to our core markets, governments, and highly regulated industries. Capgemini's engagement in a broad set of commercial markets make them an ideal fit for the Leidos' cyber business. We expect the deal to close by the end of the year subject to regulatory approvals. While the terms of the deal are not disclosed, the proceeds from the sale, which we expect upon close, will be additive to our cash flow expectations for the year and subject to the same capital deployment philosophy we've consistently indicated in the past. We'll continue to balance investments for growth, regular quarterly dividends, debt pay-down, and share repurchase to enable an optimal cost of capital, while also driving increased value for our shareholders. As we've indicated more recently, since achieving our targeted leverage ratio, we don't plan to repay debt beyond required amounts. During Q2, we continued to execute on our share repurchase program buying back an additional $90 million in stock which brings the year-to-date total to $100 million. Looking more broadly now, the macro environment remains favorable with outlays up over prior years as agencies work to spend against the budget increases approved and finalized in the omnibus that was signed on March 23. The final quarter of the government fiscal year, which is our third quarter, will be important to determine how much of the budget authority will convert to outlays. The remaining unspent budget authority would then further increase unobligated balances projected for fiscal year 2019 and beyond. As we look towards next year, fiscal year 2019 spending bills are well ahead of previous years in the legislative process, with the passing Tuesday of the Senate's authorization bill at $716 billion. Although congressional leadership is committed to conference on the authorization bill this month, it is likely that the fiscal year 2019 appropriations bill will lag and we will again start the fiscal year with a continuing resolution, the length of which will likely be determined by the outcome of the mid-term elections. Even under a CR, however, fiscal year 2019 would start at fiscal year 2018 current service levels which are significantly higher than they were in fiscal year 2017. While uncertainty remains, the backdrop is still positive with higher outlays in fiscal year 2018 and 2019 and we're committed to leverage our strong competitive position and technical differentiation to drive value for our customers and grow our business. Next, I'd like to highlight a few notable changes we've made with respect to our board of directors during the quarter. First, in May, in accordance with our governance guidelines on the rotation of board leadership roles, our board appointed Bob Shapard as Lead Independent Director, replacing Larry Nussdorf in that role. Bob has served on the board since 2013 and brings more than 30 years of experience in executive management and finance to the board. Bob was most recently CEO of Oncor Electric in Dallas. We look forward to Bob's continued leadership and contributions in his new role. Larry, who has been a Director since 2010, continues to serve the board and was appointed Chair of the Audit and Finance Committee. We also announced in June the appointment of Bob Kovarik to our board of directors. Bob brings more than 40 years of experience in risk management and auditing for major corporations, including serving as a Partner at Ernst & Young. Additionally, Bob sits on the CareFirst Board of Trustees and serves as Chair of its Investment and Finance Committees. We are pleased to have Bob join our Audit and Finance Committee, further increasing the strength of our board. During the quarter, we made further investments in our employees through our training and development programs and through additional benefits in order to improve our overall competitiveness in attracting and retaining talent. We've seen a notable improvement in retention rates year-to-date versus the prior year, and we've had good success in hiring new talent to the organization. We'll continue to assess and improve areas that will strengthen the ability of our talented workforce to provide best-in-class innovation and solutions to our customers. While we still have two quarters to go in the year and a back-half loaded growth profile, we're pleased with our achievements and progress to-date, and remain committed to driving profitable growth. With that, let me hand the call over to Leidos' Chief Financial Officer, Jim Reagan, for more details on the quarter and our guidance. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Roger, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. Overall, we're pleased with our second quarter financial results which demonstrate solid growth across the company. Highlights for the quarter include robust sequential revenue growth, strong bookings, profitability and cash generation. Additionally, we generated non-GAAP EPS of $1.12, which is the highest quarterly earnings we've seen in five years. Our continued focus on profitable growth resulted in another solid quarter of bookings in Q2, generating $3.4 billion in net bookings and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4. This strong performance was across all of our segments, each of which generated book-to-bill ratios above 1.0 during the quarter. Specifically by segment, our Defense Solutions segment generated about $1.5 billion in net bookings, resulting in the second quarter book-to-bill of 1.2. This extends the trend that we've seen in the last couple of quarters, reflecting the efforts the team has put into our business development process for more than a year now. Trailing 12-month book-to-bill in the segment is 1.2. Bookings in our Civil segment were also strong at $1.1 billion in net bookings, a substantial increase from the prior quarter's $635 million, driven by wins with the Department of Energy, Army Corps of Engineers, and TSA, to name a few. Trailing 12-month book-to-bill in our Civil segment was also strong at 1.2, again, highlighting the investments that we've made in business development. Our Health segment generated the strongest book-to-bill during the quarter at 1.8, resulting from $800 million in net bookings that reflect wins with the Defense Health Agency, the VA, the CDC, and several others. Now, moving on to the P&L. Consolidated revenues for the quarter grew 3.5% sequentially, reflecting revenue growth from new program wins such as NGA items and the ACE-IT, as well as the expansion of scope and on-contract growth with many of our existing programs. We expect these ramps to accelerate through the rest of the year. Our non-GAAP EBITDA margin increased 70 basis points sequentially from 10.2% last quarter to 10.9% in the current quarter, demonstrating the success we've had in managing programs for profitable growth. The increased program margins and revenue growth resulted in sequential increases in both our GAAP and non-GAAP operating income of 25% and 10%, respectively. Our non-GAAP operating income of $260 million excludes the impact of $61 million in adjustments, including $51 million in acquired intangible amortization and $8 million in restructuring and integration costs. Net interest expense of $35 million was largely in line with our expectations. Non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was the highlight in the quarter coming in at $1.12. These earnings were calculated on the basis of a weighted average share count of 154 million fully diluted shares outstanding, flat with the prior quarter. We exited the quarter with a fully diluted share count of 153 million shares, down 1 million from the prior quarter, reflecting the share repurchase activity that Roger indicated earlier. Cash flows from operations during the quarter of $271 million grew from the prior quarter and reflect the seven-day reduction in DSO from 71 in Q1 to 64 in Q2. This improvement reflects actions we've taken since the financial systems consolidation to streamline our billing and invoicing processes. We will continue to optimize these areas, but consider the current DSO level to be close to a normalized level for the company. Beyond the share repurchase activity and contained within our financing outflows, we made $27 million in payments on outstanding debt, which includes a $10 million payment triggered by the cash flow sweep provision in our credit agreement. Now, let me share a few highlights from our segments. Revenue grew substantially in our Defense Solutions segment during the quarter, up 7% from the prior quarter. The sequential growth was driven by the ramp-up of new program wins, which we expect to continue throughout the year. Revenue in the business also reflects the slight year-over-year increase, reflecting new program revenues that offset the contraction of other programs which experienced losses in the prior-year period. Defense Solutions' non-GAAP operating margins were largely flat, both sequentially and year-over-year as the positive effective program completions generally offset the impact of program ramp-ups in the period. Civil segment revenues declined 2% sequentially, reflecting continued wind-down of prior-year program losses. On a year-over-year basis, Civil revenues were down about 6% as the prior-year period was particularly strong, driven by timing of materials purchases on programs and certain one-time write-ups. The strong bookings in the Civil segment provide a good leading indicator of its forward growth prospects. Non-GAAP operating margins in our Civil segment declined 140 basis points sequentially to 10.3%, primarily driven by contract mix changes. Health segment revenues increased 6% sequentially, driven largely by increased volume on existing programs. Additionally, non-GAAP operating margins in the Health segment increased over 500 basis points sequentially to 17.7% as our customer-facing teams have done a great job driving on-contract growth with some of our T&M programs. On-contract growth typically has shorter sales cycles and this is an area where we have less forward visibility than growth driven by new wins or takeaways. However, as we've indicated, on-contract growth is an important factor in our growth plans for the year and we're certainly pleased with our team's actions to help achieve this. Now, onto our guidance. Our results to-date and particularly our recent wins position us well to deliver on the guidance we've previously laid out and reflect our expectations for continued sequential revenue growth. And to reiterate, we expect revenues in the range of $10.25 billion to $10:65 billion, adjusted EBITDA margins between 10.1% and 10.4%, non-GAAP diluted EPS between $4.15 and $4.50, operating cash flow at or above $665 million. In conclusion, we are pleased with our results in the quarter and the sequential increase in revenue, margins, and bookings which position us well to deliver our long-term growth, margin, and cash flow targets. Before I open it up to questions, I'd also like to mention that we've set the date for our upcoming Analyst Day for September 17 in New York. Roger, Kelly, and I, and other members of the executive team will be on hands to present an update on the company and our strategy, and we look forward to seeing many of you there. With that, Rob, let's open it up to take questions. Operator : Thank you. The first question is from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Jon. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, Roger and Jim. Just in terms of the second half pick-up, can you just give sort of maybe from a bigger picture on take on the essentially headwinds that you've experienced flipping any tailwinds and just how those two pieces interact with one another? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I know you're talking about the ramp and the growth we have in the second half. On the headwinds, I'm not seeing a lot that I worry about relative to headwinds, with the book-to-bill in the quarter, most of this is in backlog. Some of it is, what we call, incumbent capture and that's where we've been successful in winning a business that another contractor had. And normally you'd say, well, can you get the people to work on the contract and therefore generate the revenue? And when these programs are takeaways from another contractor, very often we get a majority of the workforce to leave that company to come to work for us. And so, we're actually very comfortable with the ability to get the talented workforce on the contract and performing and therefore billing and doing revenue recognition. So, we don't see a lot of headwinds. I mean, there's the usual government shutdown, what happens to the administration, but those are the risks that we face year-in and year-out. So, we are obviously very comfortable with where we are. It was great to get this one in the book and we feel confident about going forward. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then just following \u2013 thanks for that perspective. And then, just following up on that, would you quantify perhaps in terms of second half sales plan, how much is in backlog? How much do you need to win? How much it needs to come out of customer? Essentially, how much is in your control or not in your control? And if you can't quantify, perhaps how where we sit today compares to previous years as you look at the second half plan? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Jon. This is Jim. For the back end of the year, there is roughly about 5% of our target that is kind of go-get, with the balance of it being in backlog or being easily realized on contract growth or expected pick up on re-compete. But that gives us a lot of comfort of hitting that number. One other thing that's probably worth mentioning, also Kelly has reminded me here that when I reiterated our guidance, for some reason, I said $665 million, I meant to say $675 million for that cash flow number; again, at or above $675 million. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Understood. Thank you. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Jon. Operator : The next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Good morning, Bob. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Good morning. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: So, I thought maybe this is pretty good time to walk through GENESIS and then the VA win and compare the two and also an update on where GENESIS is, maybe you can address the rescission. And just what's the right way or the right context for us to think about those two programs and the progress? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, first of all, as you noticed that we put comments relative to the VA in my prepared remarks. There's always been a lot of interest around where that contract sits. And I'm sure you noticed in the quarter that Cerner was able to sign their contracts and then we were able to negotiate our relationship with Cerner on the VA program. And there is still some program planning going on and we expect that to be more booked on a current basis rather than a single event. On what we call the Defense Health Management Systems (sic) [System] Modernization program or DHMSM program, again, it's on track. We expect to begin wave deployment activity in Q3, which is moving from the IOC sites to the production environment. And that will get us off and running, and then, there are various 200 sites or so that we will roll the program out to over the next year. And so, again, it's on track, fully funded, great support from the program. We were up on the hill talking to legislators and strong support for that program going forward, and we should be fully deployed by 2022. So, all those numbers that we've given you in the past still holds and the customer, I expect, will announce sort of their schedule on their sites sometime in Q3. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Roger, does the timing hold? It sounds like you're saying it does, but again, there's been a lot of negative news on this program and I thought this would be a way for you to clarify. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. I don't characterize a lot of what people may have read as negative news. I think we do a lot of electronic healthcare records implementations. Anytime you do this, you are changing the way people do business and we see this when we do a commercial installation and change is a tough one and change management is really, really important. And if you go in on any IT system, a general ledger or an HR system and you ask the users shortly after the implementation of a new system, what you don't like and what you would like to see change, you're going to get a long list. That's why we did IOC sites. Madigan is a large hospital. The whole reason the program was put together the way it was is for us to install it in IOC site, put people on the ground, understand what they liked and what they didn't like, gain that knowledge, take those lessons learned, put those into our deployment plans, and go forward. There are a lot of huge benefits that have occurred to the environment up at Madigan relative to clinical results. And that's why the DHA elected to go with a unified electronic health care record system and they're reaping the benefits of that. I know DHA is really interested in standardizing clinical workflows and that's part of the program and we've been successful in doing that. And see, I didn't mention because I think we \u2013 you probably have read this, but the Coast Guard has been added to the program. And we're in discussions with our customer about definitizing what the Coast Guard phase of the program looks like. So, again, strong support on the program. The system is working well. I think veterans and active militaries will benefit from having the same Cerner backbone and we're just pleased to be involved with both programs. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And on that, Roger, how do we think about the scope for the VA contract versus what you're doing for the DoD contract? Is it essentially the same thing? It's just in the second case or on the VA piece you're the sub? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, probably not exactly the same. On the DHA program, the Defense Health Management program, we're the prime. So, cloud hosting, the Cerner organization, Accenture, Henry Schein, all flows through us. So, we recognize significantly more revenue on that program. On the VA program, Cerner is serving that role, and we're a support to them. So, we will only recognize the value-added that we provide. And our role will be certainly different. We will not be the program manager. We don't have contract performance responsibility as the prime integrator. That's just not what we do. We're going to be in the program office. We're going to do helpdesk. We're going to do sustainment. We're going to help them with integration. We're going to help them with security and cybersecurity, a lot of the value-added that we provided under the DHA program. But again, we will not be the name on the contract. We will not be prime. But we're going to be fully supportive of Cerner and we're committed to the success of the program and to make sure that the vets get the best electronic healthcare records system that industry can possibly provide. And that's our mission and our goal and this is the way the VA has elected to go forward and we're completely supportive of the customer. But, it does, from your standpoint, say that we will recognize significantly less revenue on the VA program than we would on the Defense Health program because of the way the contract structure works. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And on profit, the same thing or no? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: We haven't disclosed anything on profit relative to the VA program. I would say it's in the same order of magnitude. We don't expect it to be significantly higher or lower. And no, I don't think it is going to be that different. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And last question on this, and I apologize for sticking to this, but there has been confusion about it. But why the shorter-term nature of this Veterans Affairs contract and the one year base... Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: I'm not \u2013 because we're a sub. I really can't speak to service contract with the VA. I mean, that's best for the Cerner team to talk about. The size of the program, the implementation of the program are comparable over time. But our relationship with Cerner is more of an umbrella for which we will buy \u2013 they will buy services from us, kind of, like a task order by task order or year-by-year basis. We're not getting into a lot of contract details. There is a lot of similarities between the program and how we negotiate year-over-year task orders on the DHMSM program. They're both roughly 10-year programs. The VA program is starting three years later than the DHA program, but they are roughly the same duration, the VA because of the number of implementations and the size of the VA is probably a larger program, because there's just more VA facilities out there than there are in the DHA environment. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you for clarifying. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your questions. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Very quick follow up. Roughly, what percent of the VA program revenues that Cerner has do you expect you will have? And what is the profile of your build? Given what you're doing, I would guess you have relatively little in the first two years. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Cai, this is Jim. Thanks for asking. Right now, we're continuing to size up how that's going to look and it's probably not appropriate this time to venture to guess on how big the overall VA program is going to be. Like Roger indicated, it is going to be larger overall in size. And because we are going to be a subcontractor or are a subcontractor of Cerner, the way it shows up on our books will be a lot different. But certainly, a lot of the same elements of how we add value to that program will be similar between VA and DHMSM. But at this point, it's going to be difficult to size what percentage of the total we're going to get. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: And is it fair to say that basically you don't have much revenue in the first two years, because your functions look like they are related to implementation? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: There might be \u2013 certainly for the next couple quarters, it's going to be de minimis. But going into next year, there might be some element of material revenue as we start to help Cerner with some of the start-up phases of the program. But again, commenting on the size \u2013 the revenue size of individual programs is generally not our policy. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it. So, you had indicated before that 95% of half two revenues are in backlog. That implies a certain revenue target. When you make that comment, Jim, are you talking about the midpoint of the guide, the low end, the high end, how shall we think about that? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, just to make sure I was clear, I was saying that 5% is what we have to go \u2013 is still kind of go-get. Meaning, it still has to be awarded to us... Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Go get to hit what, what sort of a revenue number? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: To hit the midpoint. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Midpoint. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yes. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much. And then, \u2013 yeah. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: So, there is upside on contract growth. There is upside in things that we've talked about that have some volatility in the health group. So, it is really hard to say exactly and again, because we've got our revenue guidance still fairly wide. The velocity of the ramp is still something where we see some possibility for upside or other volatility. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. And in discussing revenues, you compare them, you bench them against Q1. So, a quarter-to-quarter compare; whereas usually, people tend to look at things on a year-to-year basis. Normally, you have a seasonal downtick in the fourth quarter. How should we square this sequential build in business with that normal seasonal pattern? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: The seasonality that we have seen in the past typically results in the number of workdays and seasonality around vacations. Here, we're going to \u2013 we've seen such strong bookings in the last couple of quarters and looking at how that phases out. We've built a contract waterfall from the bottom-up, Cai, and where we see hiring happening and where we see our ability to rebadge people off from incumbent contractors over to the work that we've taken away from others is where we really get our confidence and the full-year guide. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Terrific. Thank you very much. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: And speaking to your point on year-over-year, that's why, we have spent some time focusing on sequential growth rates in our commentary for this quarter compared to in the past. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Terrific. Thank you so much. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Okay. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Krishna Sinha with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your questions. Krishna Sinha - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi. Thanks. On the VA contract, can you just talk about how it overlaps with DHMSM in terms of the timeline of the installs? Because I know when it was first being released in the press or you talked about in the press, a big part of the VA installation case was that it would closely follow or mirror the DHMSM install timeline. So, can you just give us a sense of how the overlap happens between those two programs in terms of installation sites and waves? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, you're asking for a level of detail probably beyond which I'm qualified to answer. Let me talk in general. The way the programs are phased, we'll be implementing essentially a production program starting in the third quarter. And the VA program will follow that and will benefit from the work that has been done under the DHA program, all right. And I think the plan is that they will go through the same process that we did under the DHA program. They'll go through a period of configuration of getting the Cerner product prepared for the VA. They'll probably go through some kind of an IOC side or prototype and then they'll roll into production. Because the program started a couple of years behind the DHA program, it probably will be behind us by some period of time. But all the specifics on the VA program, I would kind of direct you to Cerner, because they are the prime contractor, and it's really their role to talk about the waves and what the customer has in mind. And we're in a good position to inform you on what's going on with the DoD program and where we are with rollout of DHMSM. And our position is really one that is to support Cerner on VA and that's really probably the best way for us to handle that. Krishna Sinha - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then, on your win rates, can you just talk about what your new award win rate is? And then, also, what \u2013 can you talk about average sort of timing between when you bid for a contract and when it's awarded? So, the contract wins that you had this quarter, when did you begin bidding on that and how did that stack up in terms of the average time between the bid and the award? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, first of all, we don't ever put out actual win rates. So, we do try to give you a sense of where they're trending and we made the comment that our numbers are up. And frankly, across the board in all kinds of categories, we talk about re-completes, takeaways, new awards and what have you. It's a complex business, as I'm sure you know. And in any quarter, when we add something to backlog, we have what we call on-contract growth and that could be a cash quarter we pursued even within the quarter, and some of our business is actually very short cycle certainly in the commercial healthcare business, that can be 6 to 10 weeks from bid to award. And then, we have other programs that are literally years. And with protests and delays in government, it could be nearly two to three years when we started pursuing to when something is actually awarded. So, it's a fairly mixed bag, but somewhere between probably 12 to 18 months is a good figure of merit to carry in your hand. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. And it's probably worth saying, in some cases, things flip pretty quickly and the VA contract is an example of one that was less than that. But, if you get back to win rates, it's probably worth amplifying that one place that we've been really pleased with our performance on win rates is on takeaways, which are particularly difficult to realize and our increased success in building new business that is held by others has been pretty gratifying. Krishna Sinha - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And one quick last one on your pipeline. I'm sorry if I missed it in the prepared remarks, but what is your amount of bids outstanding and what was the increase sequentially? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. The bids outstanding is about just under $25 billion. I think it's like $24.6 billion and it's roughly consistent with what we saw last quarter, primarily because we had a lot of new things coming out of the pipeline that have been awarded. So, that's why, it's roughly flat. Krishna Sinha - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your question. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Can you talk about the TSA contract that appears to have come back to you and how that sort of \u2013 where it stands as far as being a full contract as opposed to a bridge, and how it would fall into the bookings numbers? And also, is that part of the uptick in the outlook for the second half? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I'll give you as much color as we have. I think, Ed, you're talking to a program that we refer to as the TSA ILS or Integrated Logistics Support contract, for which we were a partial incumbent, and it was a very heated competition that we lost. As you know, we filed a protest, we lost the protest. It would appear that the TSA has come back to us and asked us to extend our legacy contract. They have a unilateral right to do that for a period of time, where they can literally just call us up and say, we want you to continue to perform with the contract that you have. We were under today that unilateral extension that leads to a discussion to a bilateral extension. And what we expect, we will negotiate a bridge contract with the TSA on a bilateral basis. And that we think that sometime in the future, that will lead to a re-compete and that they will think about what their needs are to support inspection to equipment in airports, that they will write a new request for proposal. They'll come out with a new solicitation and that sometime in the future and we're talking maybe, it could be a year for the TSA to put together a new procurement package and to get that out in the street, but that they will go through a re-procurement effort. And so, our results in the quarter, there might have been a month of unilateral extension that was in backlog, something like that, very de minimis. If we can get a bridge contract negotiated, which you're saying, we hope to do that soon. Then, that could be like a year's worth of business that we might book in the third quarter. Again, not a needle-mover for us, but a program that we care a lot about. We all travel through airports. We're committed to support the TSA customer and to keep the equipment well maintained and allow us all to travel, but that's a short-term bridge. The period of months or maybe a year, year-plus, then we expect the TSA in 2019 probably to come out with a new procurement, and we will assess that. RFP, when it comes out, like we do with all business, and we'll likely bid on it and we'll see where that goes. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : My other question is around the divestiture to Capgemini. I believe it's about $100 million in revenue. Is that the right number? Is the margins above or below the corporate average, EBITDA average? And then, the tail end of the question is, is there more possibly to come on the M&A divestiture side? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Ed, thanks for your question. We really haven't been in the business of disclosing the size of the business that we're divesting or the margins that that business was carrying. The main reason that we made the decision to divest it is that it simply is a business that had a better home in a place like Capgemini and we are continuing to provide cyber capabilities and cyber support for all of our customers, again, primarily governments and regulated industries where it's much more in the fast current where we play. In terms of future divestitures, we're always thinking about ways to reshape the portfolio through acquisitions. And I would never say never on additional divestitures, but I wouldn't say that you should expect to see one next quarter, but we're never going to say never on that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Gavin Parsons - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, everyone. It's Gavin on for Noah. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Oh. Hey, Gavin. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Gavin. Gavin Parsons - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. A pretty strong quarter on free cash flow. I think you're pretty much near 50% of the full-year target already. Obviously, that had a pretty good DSO number in it, but I was just wondering if we should expect the back half to have its typically strong seasonality if you thought there was a little bit of pull forward this quarter. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Gavin, there obviously was some pull forward in the quarter because we had a DSO reduction that was faster than what is normal. And with that said, we're very pleased with our ability to continue to ring cash out of the balance sheet. And this year, 43% of our full-year target was achieved in the first half of the year. Typically, that's between 20% and 25%, just because of the normal seasonality on cash. So, I think that that is a good proof point of how well we're executing. This isn't just a billing thing. This is execution on programs. And happy customers pay faster, and that's also part of what's contributing to strong cash. It certainly makes us more comfortable that we'll achieve or overachieve on that $675 million-plus number that we've articulated. Gavin Parsons - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Correct. I believe you said that $64 million is a normalized number, close to a normal level. Is that more of a 2018 comment? Do you have stretch targets beyond that or kind of what would we need to see if you wanted to bring that number down? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. There's certainly a part of the $64 million that relate to some longer term receivables that we have on a few programs and those will continue to work their way down. And we're always going to be looking for ways to take days out of the capital conversion process. And I think that we're never going to stop looking to continue down into the 50s million. But I think that it's fair to say, as you suggested, that 64-ish million is a reasonable number that we would be focused on through the end of the year. Gavin Parsons - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. And if I could, just one quick last one. Great book-to-bill in the quarter. Just curious how that stacks up of long-cycle versus short-cycle bookings and how we should think of that phasing over maybe contributing to the rest of the year? I know you said you had the 5% go-get versus thinking of those bookings as more contributing to 2019 or 2020 growth rate. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I think that you should think of those as having a lot of contribution to 2019 and 2020. We commented last quarter that we're seeing some lengthening of the average contract award or average task order award duration and we're continuing to see that trend into the second quarter. And I think that we probably have a reason to think that the average contact length will continue to increase into Q3 and Q4. Gavin Parsons - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you very much. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Gavin. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hi, Sheila. Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC : Can you guys just give me an idea of how large of the programs are that are ramping down and what sort of anniversaries as we get to the second half? And then, also, if you could comment on any profitability changes as some programs ramp down and ramp up going forward? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: I can't tell you that we have the detailed roll-up of what those roll-offs are. A lot of those, however, did complete their ramp down in Q2. And so, that's why again we're seeing this inflection to growth on a year-over-year basis that we're going to see in Q3 and Q4. We didn't see year-over-year growth in Q2, but, of course, when you take a look at the sequential growth rate and the book-to-bill and our look at the bottoms-up waterfall, it's where we come up with the expected growth rates in Q3 and Q4. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Joe DeNardi with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions. Jonathan G. Ladewig - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Yes. This is Jon Ladewig for Joe. Good quarter, guys. Just really wanted to ask about the corporate other income line. You had a step down this quarter and we were just curious what your thoughts are for this number on a long-term rate over the next few years. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: The number that you're seeing there is getting closer to what you're seeing. As we continue to look at reduction and streamlining of our corporate expenses, including real estate and including corporate staff, we're going to begin to converge on what you're going to expect to see on an annualized basis. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tobey Sommer with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Over the next few months, as the government starts to spend the additional funds as a part of the budget, how do you think that's going to manifest itself most? Is it going to be additional funds obligated to existing contracts, new starts, just kind of love to hear your perspective on that? Thanks. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: We feel pretty good across the board. There's a lot of attention on what's going on in the DoD, but remember, we're more diversified than that. So, the DoD, I think the headlines are they're going to buy more airplanes and trucks and ships, and that's all good. And that tends to grab the headlines. What's also happening is, they're spending more money in R&D, which is important to us, and they're spending more money in readiness which is maintenance, repair and overhaul, which is important to us as well. So, we see the service side benefiting from the uptick in outlays. So, the good news is, we've got the omnibus signed. The money is in the pipeline. Agencies are trying to spend that to increase the effectiveness of what they do with their mission. And we've seen now finally some of that money start to come through. We've seen procurements that have been in flow for a long time finally get awarded. And we've seen protest periods come to an end. And so, it's not a bad summer. I think we're all looking at the fall, the midterm, the legislation and legislative process, and hoping that this goes smoothly, and that we get our bills and we get things passed. But history here in Washington says it never goes quite as smoothly as we would all like. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Brian Ruttenbur with Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ruttenbur - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Thank you very much. Just a question on \u2013 so far into the quarter, the third quarter, can you talk about bookings and trends? Is it going to be seasonally strong more so than normal with the budget flush or do you see that third quarter maybe not as seasonally strong and fourth quarter be a little bit stronger? I've heard a variety of comments coming out of companies that maybe some things are overlapping into fourth quarter where you normally have this huge budget flush in third quarter. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of bookings? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, Brian, I'll talk a little bit about it. Of course, this is a second quarter call and we're not announcing results for the third quarter. First of all, everyone knows that our third quarter has always cyclically been a strong quarter for us and all the indications are that it will be that again. We had what I think is a very nice second quarter. And I really can't judge second quarter now versus third quarter, but we've always had a strong third quarter. It is a period of time when the government wants to get their awards out on the street, they want to get funds obligated before the end of the fiscal year. We expect to see that again. There were some programs that we were awarded in second quarter. Honestly, I thought they might rollover into third. So, there is a little bit of movement from third quarter to second quarter. But, we see nothing structural that says third quarter is going to be different than it has been in prior years. Budget flush, maybe not quite as aggressive as we've seen in the past. I know within DoD, most of what they got was two-year money, so that they don't have to get it obligated before the end of the fiscal year. That's not completely true of some of the civil agencies. So, we may see a little bit of a push from the civil agencies. But, we have all the indications that third quarter will continue to be a strong quarter for us and frankly for the other companies in this sector. And without giving anything away, we've been pleased with the quarter so far. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the floor call back to Kelly Hernandez for closing remarks. Kelly P. Hernandez - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, all, for your interest in our results and our report. We look forward to seeing you at our Analyst Day on the 18th of September in New York. Thank you. Operator : This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, during the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in the press release that we issued this morning and is also available in the presentation slides. The press release and presentation, as well as the supplementary financial information file are provided on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.leidos.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Kelly, and thank you all for joining us this morning for our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Our results in the quarter demonstrate a continued build of our growth trajectory, both in the short term and in the long term, as evidenced by revenue and bookings strength. Revenues grew 1.8% sequentially and inflected to growth on a year-over-year basis as well, up 2.9%. Awards were very strong in the quarter, with $4.6 billion of net bookings in the quarter, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.8, the highest level we've had in the last three years. We ended the quarter with a record total backlog position of more than $20 billion, up 15% from the prior year quarter. Margins remained comfortably above our long-term target, with adjusted EBITDA margins of 10.8% in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date levels to 10.6%. Our commitment to translating our revenue and profit growth into cash, together with ongoing efforts to optimize our balance sheet assets allowed for a very strong quarter in cash generation, well ahead of our expectations. This higher level of cash generation resulted in a strong ending cash and cash equivalents position of $515 million exiting the quarter, and has not only given us confidence to raise our expectations for cash from operations for the year, but also allowed us to return more excess cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased an additional $62 million of shares, bringing our year-to-date total to $162 million. Year-to-date, we have deployed close to $400 million of cash in a combination of share repurchase, dividend payment and debt payments. Of the cash deployed, nearly half was directed to share repurchases. We remain committed to deploying our excess cash in this thoughtful and disciplined manner as we have done in the past. The macro environment has been mostly positive, with the end of the government fiscal year resulting in a strong level of awards across all of our segments. Some highlights include, a new $620 million single award IDIQ vehicle with United States Air Force to provide single-point integration services for F-16 fighter jet avionics shops. We're proud to serve as the non-manufacturing support integrator for the Air Force's avionics shops and look forward to supporting this critical mission. We were also selected by the Social Security Administration to support its Office of Software Engineering programs, which has a mission to improve the ability to deliver better software faster and more economically. Under this task order, we will apply our technical expertise in support of full lifecycle software development and the Agency's IT Modernization efforts which will improve services to the American public. Awards from our intelligence customers during the quarter were significant, as we were awarded about $2 billion on programs across the intelligence community, more in this one quarter than we were awarded in either full-year 2016 or 2017. The significant growth in awards for us in this area far outpaces even the robust budget growth levels indicated in the most recently available national intelligence and military intelligence program budgets. Beyond the strength in award activity at the end of the government fiscal year, there were additional positive developments in the broader markets. Defense base funding increases for 2019 were approved for a 3.2% increase versus fiscal 2018 levels, with R&D up more than the overall increase. Our DoD exposure aligns more with the base budget R&D and O&M line items, and the approved levels further our confidence in our future growth. In the broader market, although the defense budget levels are positive factors, the outlays for fiscal year 2018 which were more directly correlated to contract revenues ended the year below expectations, in that not all available budget authority was spent in the fiscal year. At year-end, DoD outlays were up 5.3% compared to fiscal year 2017 versus the 9% to 10% approved budget authority increases. In areas where we have notable exposure, defense outlays were up more than the average. Federal civil agencies also underspent their approved budget authority levels by nearly $73 billion. Outlays at year-end for these agencies increased less than 1% over fiscal year 2017 levels. This did manifest in headwinds for us in the quarter as some expected program ramps occurred more slowly than we anticipated, slipping more revenue to the right. We view this largely as timing rather than a reduction in expected revenue on these programs. Beyond this, we are still optimistic about the growth in our business, given our strong book-to-bill and backlog position, and the increased level of takeaway and new business wins that will continue to drive our revenue run rate higher. We have seen good success in hiring to support the ramp of our new business wins and takeaways, with close to 2,000 new hires added in the third quarter. As we have discussed, hiring activity is critical to our ability to develop \u2013 to deliver on our growth plans. While we are pleased with the level of hiring, we have begun to feel some impact from the tight labor market as the structural unemployment across the country is at historic lows. This had a regulating effect on our growth in the third quarter and we expect likely into the fourth quarter as well. To counterbalance this, we continue to focus on making Leidos the employer of choice in our industry, through a combination of creating the right culture, offering competitive compensation and benefits, and career advancement opportunities for our employees. To this end, we were honored to be included in Forbes inaugural America's Best Employers for Womens (sic) [America's Best Employers for Women] list which was announced during the quarter and recognizes our commitment to embracing talent with different perspectives and from various backgrounds. As we regularly examine our organization to ensure that we are optimally structured to support our long-term growth strategy, we made the decision to reorganize internally effective the first day of fiscal 2019 into four business groups : Civil, Defense, Health and Intelligence. We have had a commitment to investing in our talent and growing leaders from within, and with that said, I am proud to reiterate the leaders of these groups whom I believe will lead their teams to excel in their served markets. The Civil Group will continue to be led by its current President, Angie Heise. The Defense Group will be led by Gerry Fasano. Gerry was most recently the Chief Business Development and Strategy Officer and led the team to the improved success of our new business capture efforts. The Health Group will continue to be led by its current President, Jon Scholl. Vicki Schmanske has been appointed President of the new Intelligence Group. Vicki's more than 30 years of experience spans responsibilities across all four of our market areas, with roles in systems engineering, software and information systems development, program management, and enterprise IT services. One other notable change, as Gerry Fasano has moved into a new role, we have appointed Roy Stevens in his place as the Chief Business Development and Strategy Officer. Prior to this, Roy served as the Senior Vice President of Business Development within the old Defense and Intelligence Group, working with our military and intelligence community customers both in the United States and abroad. We are confident that these changes will allow us to better execute the strategies in our core markets, increase our agility through increased focus on our customers, and improve our success in the market and ultimately drive value for our shareholders. With that, let me hand the call over to Chief Financial Officer, Jim Reagan, for more details on the quarter and our guidance. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Roger, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. I'll start by adding some context to our consolidated results, the highlights of which Roger has already shared with you. The sequential and year-over-year increase in consolidated revenues were driven by the ramp up of recent program wins, most notably ITEMS USF (sic) [ITEMS UFS], ACE-IT and the SENS3 takeaway programs. This growth reflects our ability to quickly capture and activate new hires to drive volumes on these new programs. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter of 10.8% was fairly consistent, decreasing just 10 basis points compared to both the prior quarter and prior year. The stable consolidated margins primarily reflect a higher level of program write-ups in our Civil segment, offset by lower margin levels on the new program ramps as we have discussed previously. On a year-to-date basis, our adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.6% keeps us comfortably above our guidance range and our long-term target of over 10%. Net interest expense of $35 million was largely in line with our expectations. Non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.14, up 20% from the prior year, primarily reflecting the lower corporate tax rate. Weighted average share count declined 1 million shares from the prior quarter to 153 million, reflecting our share repurchase activity. Share count exiting the quarter was 152 million fully diluted shares. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was very strong at $371 million, reflecting 200% conversion of non-GAAP net income to free cash. In addition to higher profits, stable collections and some balance sheet monetization all drove the strong cash. Days sales outstanding remained in line with the prior quarter's level at 64 days, reflecting the strong collections at the end of the government fiscal year as expected. Additionally, during the quarter and in conjunction with our term loan restructuring, we were able to monetize our outstanding interest rate hedges, replacing them with new instruments, which reflects the term extension. This generated $60 million in cash proceeds, which are reflected in cash flows from operations. We continue to hold a fixed floating debt ratio of 70/30 at the end of the quarter. Additional cash items impacting the quarter include the receipt of $40 million on our outstanding promissory note which is reflected in cash flows from investing activities, as well as $15 million in payments on our outstanding debt, and $62 million of share repurchase activity reflected in cash flows used in financing activities. As Roger detailed the strong bookings already, I would add some additional context here about the composition of awards that the comp \u2013 that the composition of awards has shifted notably from the prior quarter. Nearly a half of the awards booked in Q3 represent new work for Leidos. So these are either takeaway wins from competitors or new program wins. The weighting of these types of awards has increased notably each quarter throughout the year, which combined with the 15% increase in our total backlog position over the past year furthers our confidence in future growth. Now, let me share some highlights from our segments. Note that the changes to our organization structure that Roger discussed will be effective starting the first quarter of FY 2019 and we don't anticipate an impact to our reportable segment structure. First, revenues in the Defense Solutions segment were up 4% from the prior year, as ramping volumes from recent program wins offset completion of certain contracts. Sequentially, revenues were roughly flat as these ramps were offset by a lower level of materials volume on certain contracts. Bookings in the Defense Solutions segment during the quarter were at the highest level since the formation of the segment, with $2.7 billion in net bookings, resulting in a third quarter book-to-bill of 2.2. Awards were particularly robust in our Intel business, with $2 billion in gross awards from our classified customers. On a trailing 12-month basis, the segment book-to-bill is 1.5, pointing to a nice growth trajectory in this business into next year. Results in our Civil segment were particularly robust in the quarter both in terms of revenue growth and margin performance. Civil segment revenues increased 7.3% sequentially and 5.3% from the prior year, reflecting strength across the portfolio, including the ramp-up of recent new program wins, higher volumes on existing programs and a higher level of net profit write-ups from risk retirement and recoveries on certain programs. Non-GAAP operating margins in our Civil segment hit a new high watermark in the quarter at 13.3%, up 300 basis points sequentially and more than 200 basis points from the prior year period. This increase primarily reflects the positive impact of the write-ups mentioned earlier, which more than offset the negative impact of the initial phase of new program ramps. Given the one-time nature of these write-ups and the higher expected mix of early phase program revenues, we don't anticipate this level of margin moving forward. Our Civil segment generated roughly $850 million in net bookings during the quarter, leading to a book-to-bill of 1.0. These bookings were awarded from a diverse set of customers, including the Transportation Security Administration, the FAA and the IRS. Now, on to our Health segment, revenues declined 4.3% year-over-year and 1.6% sequentially. During the quarter, we experienced customer-driven schedule delays on existing programs and procurement delays on other awards that we had expected would offset contract completions in the quarter. Now, while these effects were disappointing, we view these as timing items and expect to recognize these revenues throughout the fourth quarter and into 2019. Non-GAAP operating margins in the Health segment decreased 220 basis points compared with the prior year and 350 basis points sequentially, reflecting the lower revenues as well as the mix shift within the business. The Health segment delivered a very strong book-to-bill of 2.3 in the third quarter, a robust leading indicator of the growth that we expect from this business. Some of the procurement delays mentioned earlier were resolved late in the quarter, driving the $1 billion of net bookings which reflect wins within the Social Security Administration, the Defense Health Agency and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to name a few. Trailing 12-month book-to-bill for the Health segment of 1.2 positions us well to grow this business. Now, onto guidance, after evaluating the third quarter results and the expected fourth quarter program activities, we are revising our guidance for 2018 as follows. We expect revenues for the year to come in between $10.1 billion and $10.3 billion, at the midpoint relatively flat with 2017. And while we're disappointed by the slower than anticipated ramp of some of our programs, we're still confident in our growth trajectory. The midpoint of our revenue range implies a fourth quarter revenue run rate which is up 5.4% year-over-year. This accelerating growth combined with our strong book-to-bill year-to-date and particularly the heavy weighting of new business and takeaway wins in the third quarter give us confidence in stronger revenue growth in 2019. We're narrowing our expected range for non-GAAP diluted EPS around the midpoint of our prior range at $4.20 to $4.40. This includes an estimate of interest expense of $140 million, which is at the higher end of our prior range of $135 million to $140 million. We're also narrowing our adjusted EBITDA margin range to 10.2% to 10.4%, up slightly at the midpoint. And finally, we are increasing our operating cash flow guidance by $100 million to at or above $775 million. This increase is primarily driven by the strong cash performance year-to-date, as well as a $15 million reduction in expected cash flows for restructuring and integration costs related to the IS&GS acquisition. We will continue to thoughtfully execute against our capital deployment philosophy that we've consistently indicated in the past : Balancing investment for growth, regular quarterly dividends, debt pay down and share repurchase to enable an optimal cost of capital, while also driving increased value for our shareholders. And as we've indicated more recently and in light of our strong cash position exiting the quarter, beyond our commitment to the dividend and investing internally for growth, we view share repurchase as the most likely avenue for incremental capital deployment, absent potential M&A. In conclusion, we are pleased with our increased backlog, the most forward-looking indicator of our revenue growth, but we're also disappointed that the timing has shifted slightly to the right causing us to lower our revenue outlook for the full year. We will continue to focus on increasing value for our shareholders and we're working hard to deliver revenue growth, profitability and best-in-class cash flow generation. With that, Brock, now let's open it up to take questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. The first question today comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks so much and great performance guys. So, maybe give us a little bit more color on the revenue delays, which programs it was, when you expect those to pick up, with specific reference perhaps to the GENESIS program? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Great. Hey, thanks, Cai. So our compliant \u2013 our guidance, as Jim said, sort of implies flat full year to full year. But as I'm sure you noticed, we're showing growth in Q3 and the implied guidance for Q4 is significantly higher, frankly above 5%. What we found is we've reached our inflection point, we've got growth in third and fourth quarter, but lower level of government outlays resulted in slower ramps on programs, all right, and those would be programs that were new, right, some scheduled delays on existing programs, and I know you're always interested in GENESIS, so I'll come back to that. And then, as I said in my remarks, we probably are starting to see a little bit of tightening in the job market, although we're really being pleased with our hiring, we just need to think about that going forward whether we can hire, continue to hire at that rate. And that's why we elected to lower our guidance a bit. On the DHS GENESIS program, we did begin the wave deployment in Q3 at new sites and I'm sure you read about that. But despite that, there have been some delays in the program as a result of customer decisions to ensure that the IT infrastructure in some of the DHA sites is ready for deployment. They're going to be thoughtful in creating their rollout schedule. They will convert all of their sites as they anticipated in the program. The size of the program, the funding on the program is still intact. We're proud of our performance. There's always reports that come out, we had an IOT&E report that came out during the quarter, which is very similar to the report that we had earlier, which reiterated that change is hard and installing new IT systems in older environments is the challenge that we all thought it was. Frankly, we really like getting these reports. It's good data for us, as we get ready to deploy more broadly across the DHA environment. And I would highlight it usually doesn't come out in these reports that the benefits and enhancements delivered to customers as a result of the GENESIS program, improved patient care, they're seeing more patients, improvement in clinical efficiencies. For instance, there were 1,300 duplicative lab orders that were caught by the DHA's GENESIS system, and improvements in safety, which we're excited about. We increased the new fill on prescriptions in the pharmacies at those facilities. So again, Cai, we're confident about what 2019 looks like and excited about next year. And although we didn't fully anticipate some of these changes in activities and slowdowns in the quarter, we do expect deployment on DHMSM to ramp up in 2019 and beyond, as we always have, and we expect the flow through of our book-to-bill and our backlog to give us a very, very nice fiscal year 2019. Thanks for your question. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Good morning. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Rob. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks, Roger. Hi. Wanted to follow-up on Cai's question there. So what's the right way to calibrate 40% growth implied and the year-to-date 1.4 book-to-bill to revenue growth next year, if that's the right period for those bookings to fall, obviously, there's a longer duration to those awards, but what's the rule of thumb? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: It's a great question. And, of course, we don't necessarily give that kind of detail guidance. And Rob, you're really good at taking our book-to-bill and making an estimate of what the duration is and building that into your model. I just like to point to the macro environment; you can't have a book-to-bill greater than 1 quarter-over- quarter and not print growth. The average duration in our backlog is in the couple years, right, so again, you've got a great model and you flow it through. But I would, I think, emphasize maybe for some of those who haven't followed us, is it's not instantaneous. So we win a program and we're able to book it into backlog, especially if it's a new win or takeaway that we need to go, transfer people in the program, hire new people, often move into a new facility and the ramp-up can be six months to a year. And so, having a great third quarter implies things well beyond first quarter in 2019. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, and Rob, I would add to that the fact that \u2013 just to reemphasize, the second and third quarter in terms of just the trend of the makeup of the new awards that comprise book-to-bill have been increasingly moving away from some recompetes that were part of kind of the normal schedule award cycle, but more into new work to Leidos as well as takeaways from competitors. And that improves our own visibility into our growth targets for next year. Previously, we have talked about our growth rates beyond 2018 being above 3%. And the numbers that we're looking at for Q3 awards and our year-to-date number certainly point to higher confidence in achieving or overachieving on those numbers. We'll have more details on that in our fourth quarter call. The one other thing I would tell you is that the duration of our backlog has shortened slightly which points to a bit of a faster burn rate on the existing backlog. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah, I don't want to put pressure on you, because it sounds like a 3% hurdle at some point here is pretty doable. The other thing I wanted to ask you about the backlog and you've touched on this earlier, but from a margin standpoint, how do you think about the business you're putting into the backlog, and if you could reflect on the labor tightening element of that as well? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. So the work that's going into backlog, there is a lot of work that is confidently in the double-digit margin area. We are able to shape more contract awards into fixed unit price. But I would also \u2013 to be clear, there's still a lot of work that's being awarded in the high-single-digit margin area. So when we take a look at the balance of existing and new work, we're still talking about work that on an EBITDA basis balances out to north of 10%. We're continuing our work around optimizing our cost structure, which will translate into continuing a pretty competitive cost structure for new bidding and also our ability to continue driving margins competitively above 10%. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then just one quick housekeeping one, the $60 million interest rate swap expiration that you'd contemplated in your previous OCF guidance, is that the main driver of the increased guide? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Well, that's one part of it, but we're also doing, I think, a great job of optimizing our billing process. As you know, I have to give credit to the people that run the back office and have done a great job of putting us on to a single billing platform from the four different platforms we had as we came together with IS&GS. So good program performance means that customers pay you faster. And when you bill them faster, those things combine to good OCF performance. But I do have to tell you that monetizing that cash \u2013 the interest rate swap was not contemplated in our original guidance and that's part of the driver for the bump up of $100 million. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Right. Okay. Okay, thanks for clarifying. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Rob. Operator : The next question comes from Ed Caso of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. It's Rick Eskelsen on for Ed. Roger, I was hoping you can go back and talk just a little bit more about your comment that clients kind of underspent the budgets and that the outlays have been a little bit slower, maybe you can just talk more broadly about client behavior and whether you think that changes now as we enter the next government fiscal year with the national budget in place and it seems like clients have been more confident entering this year than in past years? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, overall, they are more confident and they are upbeat. Rick, but I think you have to look at it customer by customer because it's really different within the Department of Defense versus outside the Department of Defense. And we found DoD probably more confident and more willing to spend to their authorized and appropriated levels. And we have been talking about this throughout the year. Those agencies outside of DoD, as they looked at the effect of sequester and are trying to predict what will happen to them in 2019 and frankly in 2020, I think they have been more reticent to spend to their fully obligated levels and indeed, we saw evidence of that in the third quarter. Now, that means, they're spending about flat to past year, which is still good for us. And in the areas where we compete, modernization of infrastructure, IT, O&M, the spending has been solid, but not at the level of the top line growth in their budget. And we don't \u2013 I don't really expect to see a big change in that in 2019. We will all be informed a little bit here in two weeks as we get through the election and we understand what the administration is going to do as they look beyond 2019 to 2020. The good news is we got a lot of bills passed at the end of fiscal year 2018, and so for many, many of our agencies, they've got certainty for 2019. So we don't have the CR overhang that we usually have. I think that will help, but we're trying to temper that enthusiasm with reality of how the budgeting process works for our customer. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. It's very helpful. Just a follow-up on the \u2013 also you've talked about the hiring impact, it sounds like you guys still feel like you're doing okay on the hiring, but you're seeing maybe signs of tightening. I'm, I guess, curious if that has anything to do with security clearances and maybe if you can go a little bit more into sort of what you're doing on the hiring front? I know in the past you've talked about external referrals and things like that. Thanks. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Okay. A couple of questions there; let me start with the one that is an industry-wide initiative. This is on security clearances and we have engaged with AIA and PSC and our associated companies in open discussion with both OPM and the Department of Defense and the Intel community. And I know that Deputy Secretary Shanahan is taking this on as a personal initiative. We are cautiously optimistic that certainly on renewals, if not on initial clearances, that things will get better. But it is still a problem and it takes a long time, especially like for a college hire to get them through the clearance process. And for many of our programs that require a clearance, it does make it more difficult to hire. We would say, overall, we're still pleased with the number of people who want to come to work at Leidos. We're very pleased with our percentage of offers that are actually accepted, but it's a workflow process from when we write a requisition to when we actually have that person on site working on a program is a period of better than a couple of months. And so as we have got to get our reqs (00:37:48) written in anticipation of the programs, we've got to hand that to our staffing organization, by the way which does a great job. And as you mentioned, we are looking at all opportunities, employee referrals, bonuses for hiring your friend and things like that, things that you're probably seeing in the industry writ large. And our hiring has continued even in October at a very, very nice clip. We just look at the economy writ large and what's going on to employment, and we want to pass on that. There is a bit of concern, we're about at structurally zero unemployment, and that's going to at some point make it more difficult for us to hire or hire at the rate at which we've been. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Krishna Sinha of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Krishna Sinha - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi, thanks. So just to kind of simplify the math here, if I look at your guidance, your sales guidance, you pulled that down by about $250 million at the midpoint. Can you just talk about how much of that you're expecting to flow through in 4Q and how much of that overflows into 2019? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, hi, Krishna, this is Jim. The way we think about the fourth quarter is that \u2013 certainly a piece of that will flow into 4Q, although the run rate is a little bit lower than what was implicit in our prior guidance. With that said, about 5.5% year-over-year growth in Q4 is something that we're pointing at and what we're pleased with as well as the sequential growth that we're seeing there. Adding to that record backlog and book-to-bill for the past quarter, when we think about what we've said before, what our aspirations are for 2019, while we haven't been specific about what the growth rate is, saying that it's north of 3%, we're more than confident about being able to achieve that objective. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, Krishna, I think your question was of the $250 million, is that lost or is it deferred, and what we said in our prepared remarks and we reiterate here is it's primarily timing, is it's not associated with programs that we thought we're going to win, that we have lost, it might have been the case a couple of years ago. What we see here are slower ramps, customers who have the money, have the top line and are not spending it. And so we're pleased about the implication that that has for 2019. But I would also comment that although we have a lower top line, our bottom line has continued to stay very strong. And, of course, that's led to terrific cash generation in the quarter as well. Krishna Sinha - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And kind of to that point, Roger, I mean, you talked about, I think last quarter you talked about a 7% go-get target to hit the revenue guidance for \u2013 that you had set out previously, obviously that didn't happen because of the timing. But how did you perform on that 7% go-get target through 3Q? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I'll give a summary, and then Jim can touch on the numbers. I think on our go-get, our win, we actually exceeded that. I mean, I think we're really, really pleased that our capture efforts performed better than expected, where the disappointment is, we won the program, we had an expectation of when that program would start to turn into revenue and how fast it would ramp up. And in point of fact, although we may have won the program, the customer may have delayed by a couple of weeks when they want to start the program. And the \u2013 if you will, the rate of growth in the program. So we did talk about our need to win and we're very, very pleased with our team and their ability to win the programs. We are disappointed is that customers have not been as enthusiastic about starting those programs and increasing the level of spend. Krishna Sinha - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And just one more question on cash flow, obviously, you had a good cash flow result and you pulled the guidance up for the year. It looks like some of that cash flow just dropped through to the balance sheet. And I'm wondering if it \u2013 it sounds like you're pretty aggressive on the buyback or you want to be, why didn't we see more buyback in the quarter since the cash flow was so strong in the quarter? And what's the kind of level of balance sheet cash that you want to maintain going forward? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Krishna, this is Jim. When we think about the amount of cash that we want to hold onto the balance sheet, for operations, it's a roughly $200 million number. And then as we think about \u2013 in addition to that, if we have near-term M&A targets in mind, we might squirrel away some of that. With that said, I think that if we had stronger visibility into the cash flush that was going to happen at the end of the quarter from the government, if that had happened sooner, we probably would have had a little bit more buyback. And \u2013 but as you know, around the middle of September, we end up kind of going into a blackout on stock buyback. And with that said, we would have been precluded from doing anything at the end of September. I think that what you're hearing from us is that with the cash that we've got, we're confident that we will be able to get back into the market sometime during the fourth quarter. Krishna Sinha - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. That's great. I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Jon Raviv of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, team. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Jon. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Just on the cash flow, the new guidance, $775 million, you mentioned that it benefits from a couple things, the interest \u2013 the swap and also the AIT cost. Just sort of big picture, how do you see that? What do you think is sort of sustainable operating cash flow for this business going forward? To what extent should operating cash flow grow with earnings next year or not? And related to that is, how do you see CapEx trending going forward? Thank you. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, we'll certainly be very specific on what we're thinking of operating cash flow when we have our Q4 call. But the way to think about how to model that Jon is that, we'd like to think that 100% of the non-GAAP net income will end up in the operating cash flow number. And simply put, it's EBITDA less interest and CapEx, and the level of CapEx that we were seeing for 2018, we expect will come down in 2019, absent some potential one-time items relate to specific programs. We are always thinking about how to reduce the investment non-cash working capital, reducing our investment in real estate and things that aren't directly connected to generating new business. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: And Jon, I would add to that and I'm sure you've read that in the press releases, we're pretty much through the integration cash. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: And that is really exciting for us. That ends up, if you will, accumulating now on the balance sheet. And so as we've tried to in past calls is to say IS&GS integration is behind us and we're now to more normative levels, which we would have talked about a couple of years ago, and our ability to convert our operations to cash from operations. And so we're really excited about what 2019 looks like. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. I'll stick to one. Operator : The next question is from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Gavin Parsons - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, so it's Gavin on for Noah. Good morning, everyone. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Gavin. Gavin Parsons - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Just wanted to follow on Jon's questions there. Obviously, there are a couple of one-time tailwinds to free cash this year. You got the interest swap settlement. But I think you're building some working capital ahead of growth, looks like head count might even be up more than revenue, DSOs and DPOs are a little bit better, but not a ton. But you've got that $60 million of transaction and integration that doesn't repeat and higher level of CapEx. So kind of what if that doesn't reverse or kind of what of those a tailwind versus a headwind next year? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, in terms \u2013 did you say headwind instead of tailwind for next year? Gavin Parsons - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. Which of those are headwinds versus tailwinds and it kind of seems like you'd have more tailwinds than headwinds going into next year? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, one thing we've been able to do through the back end of this year and will probably help us more into the early part of next year is continued optimization of our tax position. So, on a GAAP basis, you'll see that our effective tax rate is pretty low in the quarter. And some effective tax planning is helping us there. And so, you'll see us kind of moving some non-cash working capital out of the deferred tax accounts and into the bank account for the early part of next year, that's one tailwind. We're also working and this will not be necessarily working capital, but as we continue to optimize our real estate portfolio, we'll be selling some assets there, and using that cash to consolidate real estate facilities in the Washington area, and fund some of the build-out of our new facility right here in Reston. So we're doing those things, then you won't see those in the operating cash flow number, you'll see those down in the investing cash flow numbers in Q4 and early into next year to help us, again, take less productive assets off the balance sheet. Gavin Parsons - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then on the government customer kind of hesitant to spend dollars, what does it take for them to actually really ramp up and spend more? And are they concerned about mid-terms or sequestration that they just not have the infrastructure to spend the dollars and kind of what does it take for them to actually really get to the authority increase amount? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, Gavin, it's I think a bit of all of the above. And I think it will \u2013 the appropriations will get released as they check off each one of those, let's get through the mid-terms, let's get an understanding of what 2020 is going to start to look like. The President will come out with a skinny budget right after the first of the year. If you're an agency head, you don't want to spend up in 2019 to see sequester comes back \u2013 sequester caps come back in 2020. So as becomes more clear what the 2020 budget will look like, then they will lead spend in 2019 into an expected budget in 2020. And no, your last comment was do they have the infrastructure and look, they're happy to start a new program, they need to have a program manager and they need to step up a contracts office and things like that. There's probably a little bit of that. I think most of this is, they probably didn't completely anticipate with the raising of the sequester caps, the defense and non-defense would see the increase in budget. And so, they've been a little thoughtful in actually spending to that level to make sure that it was real and that it was sustainable through 2019 and 2020. Gavin Parsons - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Do you get a bit of a sense that there is going to be a dollar shift from readiness towards modernization? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Not \u2013 I think it's going to continue to be balanced. I've heard \u2013 we concluded in the quarter the Air Force Association event and we just finished the Association of the United States Army and so we get to interface with the high level customers. And their mission-capable rate, the availability of their hardware to do mission on any given day isn't where they want it to be. And so, we are seeing increased spending in operations and maintenance, while they are thinking through their longer term recapitalization efforts. And of course, in the Air Force, they're buying \u2013 they're going to be buying F-35s. They just released the contract for T-X. The Navy is going through their fleet modernization thoughts. They have a new submarine program which they're investing in, right, and the Army continues to look at their vehicle programs. So, I think they're going to balance that hardware with increased spend in O&M. And the good news for us in that is where do they create obligation authority and they do it by making their operations more efficient, by spending on IT modernization, digital transformation and move to the cloud. And that's really good for us because that's in among the O&M and the other things we do in R&D helping our customers operate more efficiently is center in our wheelhouse. Gavin Parsons - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks so much. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hi, Sheila. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hi, Sheila. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Good morning. Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC : Just one question, just make sure it has 15 parts to it. So, can you just touch upon the F-16 sustainment contract and Social Security win, were these part of the takeaway wins you mentioned earlier in your prepared remarks, and just given the fairly sizable task order value kind of the contract step up? And if you could just touch upon the two recompetes you have in 2019, please? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Sure. Sheila, this is Jim. I'll start with the SSA win. The SSA win is actually work that we are already doing. It was one that was targeted to be taken away by a competitor, we held onto it. We're pleased with that outcome. The F-16 work, that was a takeaway from a competitor, and it was a work for our Air Force customer and we're really pleased to be taking away something that really exploits our technical capabilities very, very well. In terms of what that means for next year, obviously, with that takeaway as well as the other ones, it points to, like I said before, better than 3% growth, and we'll get more specific about that. Let me say one more thing, to foot stomp, the fact that we are continuing to be very pleased with the level of win rate, win rates that we're experiencing on these takeaways and new business awards, we are feeling like it's a proof point to the changes that we've made in business development, in our cost structure that we're getting what we think is probably at least, if not better than our fair share of these takeaways and new business. Thanks, Sheila. Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC : Can you just touch upon the recompetes, is that possible? James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. We do have a couple of large recompetes next year. As we've said before, probably our largest one is the work with the Department of Energy up at Hanford. That RFP is dropped. We're working on that proposal, and we're confident that given the past performance that we're experiencing there in our relationship with the customer that we'll be able to retain that work. But we're not taking anything for granted. We're working very hard to make sure that we're delivering innovation and competitive cost structure for that deal. Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC : Great, thanks. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Okay. Operator : The next question is from Joe DeNardi of Stifel. Please go ahead. Jonathan G. Ladewig - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. This is Jon Ladewig for Joe DeNardi. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Hi, Jon. Jonathan G. Ladewig - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: First \u2013 hey, guys. Given some of the recent commentary from President Trump calling for lower government spending in FY 2020, both on the civilian and on the defense side, does that change your view on how long this defense cycle lasts? How do you guys kind of interpreted these comments? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: See, appreciate the question, kind of one that we thought someone might ask. I think you need to do the math on what was base budget in OCO and what the administration is trying to do is to drive to a base budget without the OCO. But I think what he is trying to do, as much as I can interpret his words, is to set an expectation that it's \u2013 it can't grow at the level that it did in 2018 and 2019 forever. And I would tell you from our standpoint, we've always sort of took that into account and a more metering of top line is what was in our expectations. If you do the math, you look at debt, you look at where the federal budget is going, being fiscally thoughtful I think is actually a good thing, it's a good thing for the country and by the way the budget is certainly significantly big enough for many companies like Leidos to be successful at the current funding level. Jonathan G. Ladewig - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: The only other question I would kind of ping you guys with is, what's your win rate? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: We don't like talking about specifics on win rates. We're very happy to talk about what those trends look like, though, and especially in light of how many competitors that we see on some of these big programs that we've been awarded, you would think that those win rates on new or takeaway work would be in \u2013 on a good day in the 30s, but we're experiencing better than win rates \u2013 better than a number like that in both of those categories. And certainly the trend, I think that the upward trend that we're seeing on win rates is what is translating into the book-to-bill that you're seeing here. And again, it comes back to first and foremost delivering a proposal with innovation in it and delivering a proposal that has \u2013 because we can innovate, we can provide a cost point that is also competitive. Jonathan G. Ladewig - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. Thank you, guys. Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Jon. Operator : Our next question is from Joseph Thompson of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Joseph Marberry Thompson - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Hey guys. This is Joseph Thompson on for Tobey Sommer at SunTrust. I have one question about the platform and product related work. How much did this type of work contribute in the third quarter and how much do you expect they can contribute going into 2019? Thank you. James C. Reagan - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: It is really hard to answer that question to be fair, Joe. I think I'm hearing you asked, well, what's related to platforms. We think of it more along our set of technical core competencies. And I think that, for example, the new work we're doing for the Air Force on the F-16 program is a little bit different from \u2013 and refreshingly different from kind of our biggest power alley in IT modernization. But clearly, our ability and our competitiveness in IT modernization is probably the biggest single driver of our growth prospects and book-to-bill for the coming year. Roger, do you have anything to add to that? Roger A. Krone - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: No. I would just reiterate, Jim, what you said is that we tend to classify our work against our technical core competencies which are differentiators and we don't \u2013 unlike maybe one of the large OEMs that look at platform and services, we don't manufacture a lot of platforms. We do some. We tend to cut our business and think about our pursuits more from a capability standpoint, so. Thanks, Joe. Operator : That's all the time we have for questions today. I would now like to turn the call back to Kelly Hernandez for closing remarks. Kelly Hernandez - Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Brock, and thank you all for your interest in Leidos. We look forward to updating you again on our next call. Thanks and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Leidos Fourth Quarter 2018 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Kelly Hernandez, Investor Relations for Leidos. Please go ahead, Kelly. Kelly Hernandez : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the Leidos management team. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter ending December 28, 2018. Roger will lead off the call with notable highlights from the quarter as well as comments on the market environment and our company strategy. Jim will follow with a discussion of our financial performance and our guidance expectations. After these remarks from Roger and Jim, we'll open the call for your questions.  Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, during the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the 2 is included in the press release that we issued this morning and is also available in the presentation slides. The press release and presentation as well as the supplementary financial information file are provided on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.leidos.com.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone. Roger Krone : Thank you, Kelly, and thank you all for joining us this morning for our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2018 earnings conference call. 2018 was a continuation of our great execution. It was a year of transition as we pivoted the organization to focus on growth. We saw many successes, and I'm proud of our employees for driving those achievements. The government shutdown had a negligible effect on our fourth quarter results. And as expected, they have a immaterial effect to our first quarter 2019 results as well. Now I'd like to start this morning by discussing 4 key highlights from our results : bookings, growth, profitability and cash generation, before focusing on what we see going forward in 2019 and beyond. First, 2018 was a record year for us in bookings and backlog. We booked $13.7 billion in net awards into backlog, resulting in a 1.3 book-to-bill for the year and a record backlog of $20.8 billion. These bookings, along with other single-award IDIQ positions we won, will drive our growth this year and beyond. The strong momentum in our business development results has continued into 2019 with NASA's recent award of the NASA End-User Services and Technology program to Leidos. This is new work for us, a competitive takeaway, furthering our market share gains, although it is still subject to a protest. NEST is a single-award, firm-fixed-price IDIQ contract with a potential value of $2.9 billion over 10 years.  Second, in terms of growth, the improving win rates and ramp of revenues from our new awards allowed us to close out the year on a strong note with year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 at the highest pace we've had in two years. For the third quarter in a row, revenues grew year-over-year as new awards increasingly contribute to the expansion of our base business. Third, profitability was also a highlight for the year, as we again exceeded our target of 10% or higher for long-term adjusted EBITDA margin and delivered margins of 10.4% for the year. We continue to balance margin and growth as we drive to our long-term targets in both areas with revenue growth of 3% or more while maintaining adjusted EBITDA margins at 10% or higher. Finally, we continue to maximize the cash generated from the organization through the fourth quarter. For 2018, we generated more than 3/4 of $1 billion of operating cash flow, a 46% increase from the prior year's level despite revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Driving cash collections from the business is truly a cross-functional effort. These results show that our teams across the organization did a great job in driving cash conversion. Throughout the year and continuing into the fourth quarter, we benefited from many initiatives to monetize our balance sheet. We will continue to explore additional such opportunities in 2019.  Cash generation is important and smart deployment of that cash is essential to driving shareholder value. In 2018, our performance allowed us to return over $600 million to our shareholders or nearly 90% of our free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases. We returned $200 million to our shareholders through regular quarterly dividends and nearly $420 million in share repurchases, which allowed us to retire 6.5 million shares during the year. We also repaid $59 million of debt. These actions are consistent with our stated capital deployment philosophy.  Now we look forward to 2019 as we are focused on accelerating growth while continuing to execute our book of business. To drive this growth, we will leverage the strong defense budget and outlays, ramp-ups from our new program wins and a strong pipeline of submitted bids waiting decisions.  We've entered the year with roughly $28 billion of bids outstanding. This pipeline includes several multibillion-dollar bids, such as our Department of Energy Hanford mission support contract recompete, our DISA global solutions management operations program recompete as well as the NASA NEST bid, which I mentioned earlier. We're also submitting proposals on several other large new business and takeaway bids during 2019 and expect decisions on many of these large programs during the year.  We've analyzed what's driven our improving win rates and our success in capturing new work. While it's clear that no single factor has led to the success, the three most prevalent areas are : the strength of our technical solution, the competitiveness of our cost structure and our past performance credentials, all made possible by our talented and dedicated employees.  Further, it's clear that customers have confidence in our ability to solve their large, complex problems because of our size, scale and depth. We continue to strengthen across all of these areas, including investing in our internal R&D so we can offer increasingly advanced technical solutions. One particular area where we have seen strong customer enthusiasm is in the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning. These technologies drive efficiencies in our customers' mission, through automation and also provide deep analytical insight at speed.  We also invest in AI/ML security to make all of our data-rich information technology offerings the most reliable and secure in the industry. Our AI/ML capabilities have already been instrumental to several recent program wins with our defense and intelligence customers. With our anticipated growth, we'll need more people to join the company. I'm pleased to say we have seen improvement in our hiring statistics, as our recruiting and HR teams have implemented innovative methods to improve our success and efficiency in hiring new employees as well as improved retention rates of our existing employees.  We are also optimistic on the potential for a more efficient security clearance process with the renewed focus on this effort by the Department of Defense, which recently assumed the function from the Office of Personnel Management. When in place, this increased efficiency will mean that our employees spend less time waiting to start work on classified programs. We're finding the process is a complex undertaking that will take time to implement, but we are encouraged by the initial progress.  Now we all continue to watch what is going on in the federal government. We are pleased with the last week's budget agreement that averts another shutdown. Even a partial shutdown impacts a broad array of vital government services that touch millions of Americans and impacts the important mission of our customers. While there is still uncertainty on the debt ceiling limits and the sequester caps, we remain optimistic about the actual budgets that will be agreed upon and the spending priorities in government fiscal 2020 and beyond. As we analyze the budgetary activity beyond the headlines, we are encouraged that the government spending priorities align well with our strategy and our areas of technical strength, keeping us well-positioned to drive growth.  Finally, I'm pleased to announce that we have set May 14 as the date of our Investor Day, which will be held in New York City as well as being webcast. The leadership team and I look forward to sharing our vision for the company and more details about our strategy at the event. I hope you will find time to join us.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer, for more details on our 2018 results and our 2019 outlook. James Reagan : Thank you, Roger, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We're pleased with our full year 2018 results, and I'll start by highlighting a few of our accomplishments for the fourth quarter and the full year. Fourth quarter revenues increased 5.2% from the prior year and 2.8% sequentially, our third consecutive quarter of growth and another proof point in our growth trajectory. In 2018, our adjusted EBITDA margins of 10.4% again exceeded our long-term target of 10% or higher.  Fourth quarter margins were 9.7%, in line with our expectations and reflect typical seasonality in the margin profile due to a higher proportion of materials revenues compared with other quarters. This strong operational performance, coupled with lower-than-expected tax rate, drove a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.10 in the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the year was $4.38, at the upper end of our guidance range. Operating cash flows for the full year of $768 million increased 46% from the prior year and resulted in 104% free cash flow conversion of non-GAAP net income in line with our long-term goal. This slight miss versus our guidance target was driven by unexpected timing slips in the fourth quarter due to year-end payment system transitions at a couple of our key customers.  During the fourth quarter, we continue to monetize our balance sheet by selling our old headquarters building in San Diego for net proceeds of $79 million. The cash proceeds from this were received and recognized in 2 tranches : $14 million in financing inflows in Q4 of '18 and $65 million in investing inflows that will be in Q1 of 2019. In addition, just after the close of the year, we also closed on the sale of the old IS&GS headquarters in Gaithersburg for $31 million. Proceeds will be recognized as a cash flow from investing item during the first quarter of 2019, and these two transactions are an extension of our focus on monetizing noncore assets and increasing our return on invested capital.  Now let me share some comments on our segment results. Revenues in the Defense Solutions segment increased 3.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period, driving the third consecutive quarter of growth in the business. This growth largely reflects new program activity that expands our revenue base. Non-GAAP operating margins in our Defense Solutions segment decreased 160 basis points from the prior year quarter to 7.7%, reflecting a lower level of net profit write-ups. As a reminder, there's typically a fair amount of variability in the quarterly timing of profit write-ups.  For the full year, the segment's margins were 8.4%, flat with the prior year, reflecting a similar level of profit write-ups. Awards activity was a highlight in the Defense Solutions segment. Net bookings were over $7 billion in 2018, a 56% increase from 2017. Book-to-bill for the year was 1.4, a substantial increase over the prior year level of 0.9. In our Civil segment, the new program wins and on-contract growth contributed notably to fourth quarter results, driving revenue growth of 3.6% over the prior year period. The start-up of new programs was the primary cause of the roughly 100 basis point decline in non-GAAP operating margins to 9.7%. Overall, we are pleased in the growth in this business and are confident in our ability to drive margins higher over time in this segment. Bookings in our Civil business increased in the fourth quarter with roughly $1 billion in net bookings, which resulted in a 1.1 book-to-bill for the quarter and 1.0 for the year.  Turning now to our Health segment. Fourth quarter results were again very strong across all metrics : revenue growth, margins and bookings. Revenue grew nearly 13% over the prior year and roughly 12% sequentially. This growth largely reflects the slippage of some revenues from the third quarter into the fourth quarter as we discussed in our third quarter call. Margins in our Health business expanded in tandem with the revenue growth. Non-GAAP operating income margin of 16.1% in the fourth quarter increased more than 400 basis points from the prior year and 190 basis points sequentially. For the full year, non-GAAP operating margins of 15.2% increased 30 basis points from the prior year. The margin expansion reflects a greater mix of on-contract growth in certain quick-turn, fixed-unit-price contracts.  The Health segment also had a very strong year in awards activity with full year net bookings of $3.2 billion, roughly 75% higher than the prior year level, resulting in a 1.7x book-to-bill for the year. During the fourth quarter, we booked $1.1 billion into backlog in the Health segment, resulting in a book-to-bill of 2.2. Overall, all of our businesses demonstrated solid progress in the fourth quarter towards our growth targets, and we expect all segments to grow in 2019. Now before I talk about 2019 guidance, I want to comment on the government shutdown and its impacts to our business. For fiscal year 2018, the shutdown was in effect for 4 working days at the very end of the year, where we typically see heavy vacation usage, so there was minimal impact to our business.  The shutdown did, however, force the closure of the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, or CFIUS, which was the last approval needed to allow for the closure of our commercial cyber sale. We continue to work the process, and we expect that deal to close within the first quarter of 2019.  For 2019, the shutdown impacts to our business are also relatively immaterial. But given the volume of questions we've received on this, I'll provide some context. First, we estimate our aggregate revenue impact resulting from the shutdown to be approximately $11 million. This effect is largely isolated to our Civil segment, where some of our work for the FAA and the Department of Homeland Security were deemed nonessential, causing us to furlough some employees. We realize the effect that this had on those employees, and it was not a step taken lightly. We may be able to recover some of this revenue loss throughout the year, but it is too early to estimate any recovery now. The shutdown also caused some delays in the billing and collection cycle as well as with award decisions. But these effects are more timing related, and we don't expect any permanent impacts to our business from those delays.  Now on to our guidance for 2019. We expect revenue in the range of $10.5 billion to $10.9 billion, reflecting growth of 3% to 7% from 2018. We expect 2019 to be a year in which we will exceed our 3% long-term revenue target growth due to the strength of our backlog entering the year and our focus on driving on-contract growth and winning new business throughout the year. Although we do not guide on a quarterly basis, I would like to provide some context on the quarterly phasing of revenues for the year and particularly for the first quarter. Similar to 2018, we expect revenues to build sequentially throughout the year, starting from a low point in the first quarter.  Historically, Q1 revenues declined sequentially due to the lower level of material volumes compared to Q4. This year, however, we expect a greater sequential decline in the high single-digit range due to the combined effects of low materials buying in the first quarter, program transitions in our Health segment and the shutdown. From the first quarter low, however, we expect revenues to grow sequentially throughout the year and to drive to our full year revenue guidance. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins of 9.9% to 10.1% for the year, a slight decrease compared to 2018. And as we've said in the past, there is a trade-off between margin and revenue growth, and the ramp-up of our new awards will drive slightly lower margin levels in the near term.  We expect non-GAAP EPS between $4.25 and $4.60. We expect operating cash flow of at least $725 million, a slight increase from 2018 levels after adjusting for the interest rate swap monetization and the usually low cash tax rate we experienced in 2018. Following the fourth quarter sale of our San Diego building, we will move into the more material phase of our real estate consolidation activities in 2019. We will continue to streamline our footprint and reduce owned facilities, allowing us to work more efficiently and increase the level of collaboration across our functions.  As a result of these actions, we expect a lot of moving parts to the different components of our cash flow statement this year. So we've added a slide, Slide 10, in our earnings deck, which is available on our website, to help you with some of the details. Some of the real estate action increased CapEx and, therefore, reduced the free cash flow metric, while others result in inflows in cash in investing and financing activities. At the end of the day, the net of all of our balance sheet monetization activities and our real estate investments will yield a positive cash inflow for the company, and we will continue to deploy our excess cash from those transactions consistent with our stated capital deployment plan. All that said, we expect 2019 capital expenditures of between $135 million and $140 million. Roughly $60 million of that is related to real estate investments and leasehold improvements, which will drive better asset utilization. As we've said earlier, between the San Diego and Gaithersburg real estate sales, we have already closed on transactions that will drive $95 million inflows to cash from investing in the first quarter. These inflows will more than offset the onetime $60 million CapEx item that I referred to earlier. Beyond leaning out our real estate portfolio, we will continue to look for opportunities to monetize the balance sheet, which increases our flexibility and drive value for our shareholders. Now a couple of other comments to help you with modeling 2019. We expect net interest expense between $135 million to $140 million and a non-GAAP tax rate between 23% and 24%. To wrap up, we closed the year on strong footing. We generated over 3/4 of $1 billion of cash from operations. Our margins were again over target for the second year in a row, and we exited the year with a revenue growth rate of 5.2% and record backlog. We remain focused on continuing this momentum into 2019 by driving profitable growth and generating cash to drive long-term value.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin, so we can take some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Cai Von Rumohr from Cowen and Company. Cai Von Rumohr : Maybe you can help us understand like what is in your guide for 2019. Does this include anything for NEST? Does it include the commercial cyber business that you hope to close? And then maybe some color on the adjusted EBITDA margin, which looks like it's at the bottom of your expectations. James Reagan : Yes, first is that the guide does include our expectations for the ramp-up of NASA NEST. The guide does not include the commercial cyber business. And in terms of the -- our EBITDA margin expectations for the year, it reflects the fact that in 2019, we've got a number of programs, the Army Corps of Engineers program, NASA NEST, just to name a couple of them, where the ramp-up of those programs typically has lower margin than for the life of the program, and we've been historically pretty conservative in setting those -- the profit take-up levels early in the program as we plan on some contingencies. As programs reach the end of their lives and we start to wind them down, that's typically when you get more liquidation of risk, and we pick up some write-ups, as you've seen us historically have in the past. Cai Von Rumohr : Terrific. And then for a last one, maybe update us on where you are with GENESIS. Roger Krone : Yes, great. Cai, I'd be happy to take that one. So yes, we're really pleased with the program, our relationship with the customer, solid support in DHA for moving forward, a lot of enthusiasm over what's happened at the IOC sites, and how we've learned from our initial deployments. We have agreement on a full schedule for deployments. We're currently working on -- what we call Wave 1. We've identified the different groups of hospitals we're going to deploy to. We expect Wave 1 to go live in the fall. The next wave, not to confuse you, was actually going to be Wave 4, and we'll expect to start that later in the year. And then we should be running a new wave about every 6 months. At any one time, we will be in deployment of two waves concurrently.  A lot of great discussions with our customers. We've got agreement on the go-forward plan. We should be fully deployed by 2025 and, Cai, as you know, the program is expected to extend to about -- excuse me, 2023 fully deployed, and the program runs through 2025. I know you've often asked in the past about sort of a ramp-up in revenues, and we expect to see that this year. But maybe we'll give a sort of a point at a top line, something like that. And again, very enthusiastic about the program, great relationship with our customer, DHA. Their strong commitment to put this technology in place to increase the health care for our active military. Operator : Our next question is coming from Krishna Sinha of Vertical Research Partners. Krishna Sinha : On your operating cash flow guidance for the year, obviously, I see the slide about the real estate, but I'm just talking about the operating cash flow. Can you just give us some puts and takes there about what you're expecting? What's not being included or not recurring from 2018 to 2019? And just kind of what we can expect from the forward trajectory may be beyond 2019 in terms of cash flow for the business on an underlying basis? James Reagan : Sure, Krishna. Thanks for the question. The two big things that occurred in 2018, which are not recurring in 2019, and that's reflected in the go-forward guide. First, we -- as part of monetizing the balance sheet, we took $60 million of cash for interest rate swaps that we could monetize in conjunction with extending the term of our term loan facility. The second thing is we had some opportunities to monetize some deferred tax assets. Now these were tax assets that were fully reserved anyway. So -- but that was $65 million of cash that we pulled in. That's also reflected in the GAAP -- I'm sorry, the GAAP effective tax rate of about 4.5%. So those things aren't for recurring, although we are always looking for opportunities to improve on our tax rate. So those are the big things.  And then there are also a couple of items, and they're primarily program related. One of the large contracts that we just won will require us to buy some assets, and that's a roughly $40 million cash flow headwind that we will end up recouping over the life of the program. Operator : Our next question is coming from Robert Spingarn from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Robert Spingarn : I wanted to ask a high-level question about the guidance from a segment perspective. In other words, how you're thinking about the growth across the segments, and then the same for the margins. And this has to do with just some of the movement that we see in 2018, especially sequentially with regard to margin. So Jim, if you could give us some understanding, some color there by segment. James Reagan : Sure. Well, Rob, I'll remind you, we don't guide by segment. But what I can give you some color on is, first of all -- because we're expecting all of the segments to be growing with some fairly large program wins, as I mentioned when I was answering Cai's question, some of these larger programs tend to have margin profiles that ramp up as we increase the operating efficiency of these contracts. We're probably expecting a little bit more growth in the Health segment and in the defense segment as compared to the other segments of the business because of the large program wins that we've had and the pace of the ramp-up in both defense and in Health. As Roger mentioned, we're getting a full point of growth just off of the DHMSM program, so I think that, that helps you with kind of setting up what the growth profile is like of the segments. Robert Spingarn : What are the biggest swings in your revenue guide, that $400 million program wise? Or how do we think about what you're assuming at the low and high end? James Reagan : Well, you mean -- I think what I'm understanding, you're wondering, well, what could give rise to the low end. What could give rise to the high end? Well... Robert Spingarn : Yes, the $10.5 billion versus the $10.9 billion. James Reagan : Yes, I mean, we've got a lot of bids that are -- we've $20 billion of bids outstanding at the end of the year. One of them, we've already pulled in from bids outstanding and into backlog, and there's the NASA NEST program, which was a takeaway, meaning it's obviously additive to our growth profile. That's reflected in our guide. And I think that the high end would be achieved if we kind of ran the table on the big ones and set us up for a 2020 that is growing at or potentially above what we're guiding to now. On the low end, it would be a significant drop in our win rates. And we -- for the last year, we've been experiencing win rates that reflect, first, a very competitive cost position that is now showing up in the velocity of new awards. The second is we have a well-defined set of technical differentiators that is probably more prominent in our win rates than the cost competitiveness. And third, the efficiency of our business development process is not only yielding great technical scores, but it is reducing the cost that we need to put into winning X dollars of new backlog. So I mean, those 3 things are really bearing out what I think gives us the confidence of at least the midpoint of our revenue guide, if not a little bit more. Roger Krone : Hey Rob, it's Roger. Just a quick follow-up on the NASA program. We are still in that kind of unique period between announcement and debrief and the protest period, so we have a couple more days to go to see whether one of the competitors is going to file a protest. So we haven't exactly put that into backlog yet. And when we do, it's a single-award IDIQ, and we'll probably book the first cash order there just so that people don't go out and put $2.9 billion in backlog. It's probably likely in the order above -- in the hundreds of millions, not in the billions. But that's just a technical point I wanted to make sure that I was clear in my comments, that it's still subject to protest. Thanks. Robert Spingarn : And Roger, just on the back of that, are there any specific awards that you would call out as being within the revenue synergies that at the time of the deal, you weren't yet ready to talk about? But now a few years in here, what are you seeing revenue synergy wise? Roger Krone : Well, Rob, that's a great question, but it's one we haven't had for a while. Well, NASA NEST is clearly one. That is a program that really has come out of capabilities that came across in the merger with IS&GS and the combination of some of the things that we had done on the technology side and the cyber, and the relationship that IS&GS had with the end user at NASA is part of that. I would say, I think our probably of win on Hanford is enhanced by bringing the company together. Clearly, that was heritage IS&GS contract, but I think we added more innovation in our offering. You can look at maybe next gen, I think, with the same view, a program we might or might not have bid as stand-alone Leidos but clearly felt we had a compelling offering to bring forward to the program. And just to kind of round out the SENS3 program and the Department of Homeland Security, one that we won last year. I think I would put in synergy we won an ABIS contract, which is an Army biometrics win, which is a collection of sort of IT and technology to be able to recognize individuals based upon biometric senders, a whole host of classified wins. I talked to AI/ML through my comments, and that has been of particular interest in the intelligence community, and it's led to some wins there as well. So really a lot of -- we talk a lot about synergy, but a lot of cross linkages of the 2 business and a lot of strength in things that we can go after that we couldn't have gone before, and then overall increase in our RFP win. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is coming from Jon Raviv from Citi. Jonathan Raviv : Jim, can you walk us through just some of -- a little bit more on the risks and opportunities in this year's sales guidance. And I'm thinking about it specifically in relation to a year ago, where, obviously, you fell a bit short in '18. I just want to make sure that the bias is really more to the upside in this year's guidance versus last year's guidance. James Reagan : Sure. Well, we always like to hit the guidance down the middle of the fairway. The NASA NEST win certainly gives us a little bit more confidence as it's yet another takeaway win, which builds the revenue volume and adds to our growth. So just to put a little bit more color on my comments of just a minute ago, I will repeat continuing to run at high win rates on takeaway and new business work, new contract awards that are kind of new to our peer group. That's one. And we have -- we continue to see really great results in win rates that reflect to the execution in our business development teams. Going back to one of the things that could be a dampener of our growth rate and that would be if the clearance process slows down or if the hand off from OPM to DoD doesn't go as I think DoD or we would expect, I think that, that could be one risk factor to revenue growth. And then the second one would be kind of a change in the success that we've been experiencing in business development. That an dour hiring processes, so far, we're pleased with what we are seeing out of our recruiting teams. But if the labor market has a sudden tightening from where we see it today, that could slow down our ability to hire people needed to execute on contract backlog. Jonathan Raviv : Okay, and then in terms of some of the bigger recompetes this year, can you just potentially give a little more color, perhaps even quantify some of that exposure in terms of sales but also in terms of profits? And the docs make it look like Hanford, big on sales but doesn't add much income. Could you just level set us on this, please? James Reagan : Yes, well, you just mentioned, Hanford and probably the other large recompetes that we have is GSM-O, which we don't disclose the dollar values of both the revenue run rate or the margin details at the contract level. But clearly, GSM-O, gizmo, would be one that we're planning on rewinning. And if we get surprised on that one, that could be a dampener, not so much for 2019, though, but more for 2020, as that contract, regardless of the outcome is going to continue to run well into 2019 for us. Operator : Our next question is coming from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Gavin Parsons : It's Gavin on for Noah. Nice to see booking strength translating to revenue growth, but I think the margin pressures made it kind of right in line with that 10% plus you were talking about, which maybe seems like a lot of pressure just on the rate of growth you're experiencing. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your strategy to grow EBITDA dollars. And Roger, I appreciate the color that early on, the contract's at lower margins and later on, you can book them at a higher margin. But whether or not these will be accretive on average over the life of the contracts and how you think about bidding when the margin initially is this low. Roger Krone : Well, okay, complex question. Let me see if I can unpack you a little bit, then I'll look to Jim. Let's see, we have a pipeline and we kind of filter against the pipeline. And we look at the structure of the contract and our ability to generate at or our target over the life of the program. We are in a fortunate position where we can decide what to bid and what not to bid. We've talked in the past about staying away from what we used to call lowest price, technically acceptable because it traditionally has lower margin and frankly, it's probably not the work that we are best equipped to do. We become interested in a program where we can create a point of difference through our discriminators, our technology, our cost structure and our size. And as such, we hope over the life of the program, right, to be accretive to our long-term EBITDA margin. The -- I think it was Jon who talked about Hanford. There are some programs, just by their nature, are going to be lower. Hanford is one of them. Has always been, that particular customer, just views the programs differently. Hanford's a very important program to us. We use it for a lot of past performance quals by which a hugely important program for the nation in cleaning up the 600 square mile site in southeast Washington is really, really important work.  But generally, we are looking at the portfolio and the pipeline with an eye to 10% or better on EBITDA. I think you reemphasize is that often, when we get started, we're more thoughtful about our booking rate and how we ramp up. And if programs are going to have transition issues, it's usually in the first year or so. So it behooves us, and I think everyone in the industry does this, to be more thoughtful about our earnings rate in the early contract. But because of our technological differentiators, we have the luxury to go after higher value-added work, which typically carries more margin with it. Gavin Parsons : Got it. And then, Roger, you talked about the DoD budget aligning well with your portfolio. Can you give us a little bit more color on kind of how you expect those priorities to go between hardware and kind of your addressable market? Roger Krone : Well, yes, there -- Secretary Shanahan is in, I think, in the first year or 2, they were looking at operational capability rate and getting the fleet and other hardware back up to a higher operational tempo. We certainly benefit from that. They're now focused towards buying end items, ships and tanks and airplanes, but not necessarily at the expense of their operational tempo. What really excites me is the digital transformation that's going on not only in the Department of Defense but across federal space, very large. They have gone to operate more efficiency, to open up more total obligation authority to buy hardware and to pay troops and to defend the country. And that's right in our sweet spot. We're really, really good at digital transformation, move to the cloud, software-defined networks, and that gets us excited. But we're also seeing a bit of a shift in how, I think, the department views the threat and a lot of discussion, if you read the National Security Strategy is what we call the physical and the kinetic threat is still important, but the virtual threat is becoming even more important, what's going on in cyberspace, some of the newer technologies. And that fits really well with where we are. We're not necessarily a company that builds tanks and big aircraft carriers and things like that. We are much more in the soft technologies, software, cyber, areas like that, electronic warfare, and we see increased spending in those areas. Operator : Our next question is coming from Greg Konrad from Jefferies. Gregory Konrad : A really strong booking year and quarter. Can you maybe talk about some of the initiatives outside of DHMSM in place that's supporting both the improvement in bookings and the revenue outlook for next year? Roger Krone : Yes, I think so. So this is Roger. And if you've been following our story for a while, you know that about two years ago, we had lost some programs that we thought were franchised. And it really caused us to go back and look at our whole business development process from cradle to grave. And we looked at what we call our win plan, how we write proposals, the staff that we had, how we view the competitive discriminators. And as we've said frankly often on this call over the past several quarters, we kind of started over. We took a clean sheet and Gerry Fasano and now Roy Stevens in business development, and we looked at why we were winning, and why we were losing, and how we presented our competitive discriminators. Even down to what bids that we were bidding on and whether we really felt we had a compelling point of difference on those bids. And I would say I think we've gotten better across the board, better in identifying the opportunity, putting it in the pipeline, working early in the bid process with the customers to understand what their compelling needs actually were. And then just the way we go about actually structuring and writing a proposal, how we deal with the proposal center, how well we represent our capabilities in between the front cover and the back cover of the proposal.  Another point that we made that's really all the way through this journey from the acquisition is there was, I think, a thought that IS&GS, the Lockheed business, had become less cost competitive in some of the bids that they had made kind of being tucked inside a large OEM. And we had huge emphasis on bringing their overhead and SG&A their wrap rates down to where we had been historically. And we look at our wins and our losses, we do a lot of forensics. And I wouldn't say we have not lost any bids based upon price, but the number of bids that we have lost based upon our cost structure is down to just a very, very few. And so we are pleased with how we have used our cost structure to solve that problem, and that has allowed us to focus on superior technical offerings that create a point of difference for the customer. Gregory Konrad : And just a follow up on your commentary around employees and employment. Is there any way to think about headcount growth for the year? And are you seeing any signs of any type of wage inflation? James Reagan : Yes, Greg, we don't provide headcount targets. I can tell you that, yes, compared to what our internal targets are, we're doing well in growing our direct employees compared to our plan. And then the other thing on wage inflation, we do put a plan in place for growth in market salaries that is consistent with the benchmarks that we see published externally. And so far we're not seeing any pressure on those assumptions that we have on our plan. It -- the market is, obviously, pretty competitive for the kinds of people we are hiring. But given our scale and given the breadth of different things that people can work on here at a competitive salary and benefit structure, so far, we're able to achieve our hiring numbers. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Rick Eskelsen from Wells Fargo Securities. Richard Eskelsen : Just to clarify on the guidance commentary for the DHMSM contract, just -- it's 1 point to growth throughout the guidance? Or is it that 1 point addition at the high end? And then also, can you talk about any grow-over amount for the commercial cyber, which I believe you said was not in the forward guidance? James Reagan : Yes, so the way, first of all, we think about DHMSM is that 1 point of growth is inclusive of the -- our guidance implies 5% growth. That number includes roughly a point for DHMSM. The second point to commercial cyber, the commercial cyber number, that midpoint of growth would be higher if you back the commercial cyber number out of our 2018 results. But at this point, we have to keep those -- those numbers confidential per terms of our agreement with the buyer. Operator : Our next question is coming from Tobey Sommer from SunTrust. Tobey Sommer : With respect to your comment on the budget and having a constructive outlook, does your commentary for the defense and intelligence budget hold true for the whole budget, including Civil? And could you comment if currencies take a little bit of edge off of your revenue growth guidance for '19? Roger Krone : I'll do the first one. I think that was a foreign exchange question on the second one. Let's see, here's a comment that I want to make sure everybody understands is that -- so I think we're all comfortable with what's going in the Department of Defense. Currently, there's been a lot of attention in what's going on in the Department of Homeland Security. We are optimistic in the parts of border security in which we operate. Our VACIS system, what we do relative to vehicle inspections, we believe that has a significant role to play in the vision of this government in securing the borders. And so not only are we pleased with what we're seeing out of the Department of Defense, in those areas in our Civil business, where we have visibility into the budget, we are also quite pleased. We think there was a large amount of fentanyl that was seized at the border a couple of weeks ago, and it is those technologies, which we think we will be able to provide to the government, and they will fuel our top line growth. By the way, we kind of feel the same way about what's going on in DoD, DOE and FAA and a lot of the other civil organizations. James Reagan : And then relative to the currency question, we don't see currency as being a material headwind or tailwind for 2019. There was a little bit of a headwind in 2018, but I wouldn't call it material with respect to the overall number. Just a reminder that international or foreign-denominated contracts are roughly 10% of our overall business. Operator : Our next question is coming from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Joseph DeNardi : Jim, I think you've talked in the past a little bit about your M&A focus and not having much of a desire just to acquire pure-play services businesses and maybe want to increase your exposure to products and hardware. I'm wondering if that means looking at services business that may have a product or hardware component to them. Or whether you'd be willing to acquire kind of or look at pure-play hardware and products businesses? James Reagan : Joe, great question and the short answer to it is -- to both parts of your questions is yes. For us, we have less interest in a pure-play services business, especially one that looks, in terms of its customer footprint, a lot like us. We don't need more of what we've got. We can compete and expand the business that we have just fine on our own. The things that we're looking for to build the company inorganically would be the kind of company with both a services and product, a product differentiator that bolts in well with the kind of work that both the target company and we do. A pure product company could also be of interest to us. In -- although I would say that the ones that we've been interested in to this point tend to have some kind of service element to them, but I wouldn't say that we're not interested in -- I wouldn't say we'd shy away from a pure product business if it was strategically -- if it fit our strategic criteria. Operator : Our next question is a follow-up from Jon Raviv from Citi. Jonathan Raviv : Roger, in your prepared remarks, you had mentioned 2019 and beyond. Could you talk a little more about that beyond by any chance? Maybe a small preview for the event in May, especially now that the combination is done. Roger Krone : A little bit. We kind of came out of the merger and we talked about 3% growth and 10%. Of course, now we're printing a little bit better than that. And as you know, we're a long-cycle business and with $28 billion, if you take the $2.9 billion out for NASA NEST, $25 billion in unawarded. Most of that is going to impact beyond 2019. The way things work, if they make an award to us this year, we ramp up. You really don't see those revenues until 2020 and beyond. And as excited as we are about 2019, if you just run your model as we do and run similar models, you can see that, that -- the submits, unawarded is going to have a larger impact on 2020 than it will on 2019. And it's the government's need for the types of solutions that we provide that gives us enthusiasm about the future, and our strong balance sheet and cash conversion gives us the currency, if you will, to invest in the future and to grow the business. And so as excited as I was five years ago when I came, as excited as I was about the merger with IS&GS, I look at the budget prospects and the needs of the government and 2019 is going to be an exciting year for us, but I think 2020 will be even better. James Reagan : And to pile on there, Jon, about 2/3 of our pipeline is either new work or what I call OPB, other people's business. And so with 2/3 of that representing not -- things that are other than just keeping and recompeting our existing work, to Roger's point, I think that the profile of the pipeline certainly speaks well for some growth opportunity. Operator : Our next question is a follow-up from Krishna Sinha from Vertical Research Partners. Krishna Sinha : I just wanted to get an update on capital deployment. Obviously, you've made some comments that you're going to try and maintain the dividend at a kind of steady rate. But just focusing more on the buybacks and the M&A opportunity and how you're thinking about those in 2019, I mean, are you close to any sort of bolt-on deals or have any in the pipe that you think would close within the next 12 months that we should be aware of? Or are -- since you'll be generating cash here, should we think about the buybacks sort of staying at this pretty high cadence that you've been generating in the last 2 quarters? James Reagan : Yes, Krishna, I think that if you compare where we sit today and looking at the M&A pipeline, I wouldn't say anything different about it compared to what I said last quarter or the quarter before that. We've got an M&A team internally that is looking at ideas that are consistent with our strategy. But we're very focused on doing good deals, not just deals for the sake of prosecuting a pipeline. So a couple of other factors that I would point out to answer your question : We are very comfortable with our leverage today, and we have plenty of dry powder and ability to take on more leverage, particularly at today's rates, to buy the right kinds of assets. But with that said, we're also not going to sit around waiting for something to come under contract before we make a decision on whether to deploy. So you could see a year -- we could be looking back on 2019 as being a year when we made a couple of acquisitions or an acquisition. But we also were able to deploy capital with some buyback and the normal level of debt buyback. Operator : Our next question is coming from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Joseph DeNardi : My follow-up was going to be if, Roger, you can just talk about the sensitivity to a CR in 2020, and maybe just the mechanics of how that would look. I think kind of the impact to spending would be more pronounced because the budget would get set at the sequestration level whereas as FY '19 just got set at FY '18's level. So maybe I'm wrong. Can you just kind of walk us through what your expectations there would be if there is a CR to start FY '20? I know it's a long way away, but just want to get your thoughts. Roger Krone : Yes, so you have it just about right. If we end up with a CR, we could snap back. And if we don't do this right, we could be back to the sequester caps and I touched on that in my remarks. I'm not the best person to predict what's going to happen in the government. I will tell you I have been encouraged by what the Department of Defense has done and their ability to cross the river and talk to the hill and explain to our elected officials how important it is to get a budget. I've been optimistic before about the ability of the department to actually get a budget passed. I'm also optimistic, moving into what is going to be a presidential election season, that people are not want to be distracted by a continuing resolution, which snaps us back to the sequester caps and requires the department to curtail programs. And so if I was a pundit, I would tell you I think it's more likely that we're going to get some kind of a negotiation, and we will get a budget rather than a CR. But the mechanics of what happens in a CR, you have about right. And if we win all the way back to the sequester caps, I think the department would have to take some significant measures to be able to get their budget back underneath that.  As you know, once they start spending on aircraft carriers and F-35s and things, there's a future bill to be paid. And when they commit to like a bulk buy or 2 aircraft carriers, that's with the assumption that they're going to get most of what they asked for in their budget request in the future. If you snap the budget back to sequester caps, they're already committed to build those aircraft carriers, and it creates a real planning dilemma for the department. And because of that, because I think our elected officials understand the importance of defending the country, and they don't want this to become a topic in the presidential debate, I think we'll probably end up with a budget. Operator : Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Kelly for any further or closing comments. Kelly Hernandez : Thank you, Kevin. And thank you all for joining us this morning as well for your interest in the company. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Kelly Hernandez, Investor Relations. You may begin. Kelly Hernandez : Thank you, Brock, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the Leidos management team. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter ending March 29, 2019. Roger will lead off the call with notable highlights from the quarter as well as comments on the market environment and our Company strategy. Jim will follow with a discussion of our financial performance and our guidance expectations. After these remarks from Roger and Jim, we'll open the call for your questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, during the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in the press release that we issued this morning and is also available in the presentation slides. The press release and presentation as well as the supplementary financial information file are provided on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.leidos.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone. Roger Krone : Thank you, Kelly, and thank you all for joining us this morning for our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Our results in the quarter show a strong start to the year. All of our businesses achieved growth, with a notable acceleration of growth in our Defense Solutions business. The revenue acceleration at margin levels above 10% reflects a continued careful management of our portfolio as we drive the organization to grow revenue and EBITDA. We again set new records in backlog as we continued our momentum in winning programs and driving bookings. Our focus on competitive differentiators has been the key to our success. By leveraging these differentiators and the scale of our organization, we have improved our win rates and conversion of our pipeline to revenue. This year, we are continuing to execute this strategy positioning ourselves well to further our growth. We look forward to sharing more about this strategy with you in a couple of weeks at our Investor Day. We developed an exciting agenda for this event, where we will provide you with more depth in our business, our competitive positioning and our strategy. You'll also have a chance to hear from and interact with our management team and see demonstrations of several of our innovative technologies. Turning now to the quarter's results. Revenue growth continued to accelerate as we added talent to ramp up on our new programs. From a business development perspective, we had a very active quarter in both submits and awards. Despite the temporary government shutdown, we booked $3.3 billion of awards into backlog, which drove a book to bill of 1.3 for the quarter. In addition, we were also awarded another approximately $1 billion in contract values during the quarter, which were subsequently protested, and as such, are not reflected in our bookings. We also won seats on several new IDIQ vehicles, which allow us an opportunity to further expand our market penetration and grow our revenues. During the quarter, we submitted a significant level of bids, including several multi-billion dollar programs. We exited the quarter with over $36 billion in submits awaiting decisions. When combined with our record backlog and strong win rates the record level of submits outstanding gives us confidence in our ability to continue our growth momentum. Profitability during the quarter came in slightly better than expected. Our focus on program execution and the use of differentiation to drive margins, particularly for fixed price work offset the impact of the high volume of early phase revenue from new program ramps. The strong revenue and profitability contributed to a better than seasonal level of cash from operations. This was augmented by cash generated through our balance sheet and portfolio optimization activities. We were very active in this area in the first quarter as we closed several transactions, including two real estate sales and the divestiture of our commercial cybersecurity business, which together drove $267 million in cash inflows, and significantly increased our deployable cash balance. Our focus on generating cash from the business is matched with equal attention by our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders in a thoughtful and balanced manner. Our capital deployment philosophy remains unchanged. Prioritizing investing for growth, both organically and through M&A, maintaining our regular quarterly dividend and repurchasing shares. During the quarter, we returned $200 million to shareholders through the execution of an accelerated share repurchase, which we announced in February. We also returned $54 million to shareholders through our regular quarterly dividend. From a macro perspective, we are encouraged by the initial proposed fiscal 2020 budgets. Both the OMD and Congress recognize the urgency with which our country needs to invest in new technologies and infrastructure that keep us safe and technologically superior to our adversaries. At this point, we're assuming we will enter the government fiscal 2020 with the continuing resolution, but it's too early to predict the level. We are hopeful for a possible bipartisan two-year budget deal as it appears Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader McConnell are in early talks. That being said, we remain focused on what is in our control and on driving share gains in the areas that align with our customers' priorities. Finally, before I hand the call over to Jim, I'd like to mention a couple of recent awards that recognize our commitment to diversity and our dedication to maintaining a strong culture of ethics and integrity. First, the Company was included in the 2019 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, which distinguishes companies committed to transparency and gender reporting in advancing women's equality. We attained best-in-class rankings for several category, highlighting just a few of the reasons Leidos is a great place to work. These categories include family care, healthcare, flexible work, career development and our diversity and inclusion strategy. This recognition is the result of our unwavering commitment to gender equality at all levels of our Company and we will continue to nurture an atmosphere that applauds diverse cultures and perspectives, which leads to better business outcomes and employee retention. Second, during the quarter, Leidos was again recognized as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by the Ethisphere Institute. This designation recognizes companies that influence and drive positive change in the business community and societies worldwide. These values are embedded in our culture and reinforced by the actions of our employees every day. Along these lines, specifically during the quarter, we continued our sponsorship of the first robotics program. Our flagship stem education program providing students in the communities in which we operate with real world engineering experience. Our employees volunteered more than 7,000 hours sponsoring competitions and mentoring teens nationwide, 14 of which advanced to the World Championships. Over the past decade, Leidos has donated nearly $3 million to stem education programs and our employees have logged thousands of volunteer hours on these important initiatives as we help faster America's next generation of technical professionals. My congratulations to our employees on their support and dedication to our communities. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer for more details on our first quarter results. Jim Reagan : Thanks, Roger, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. We're pleased with our strong start to the year and our growth momentum. I'll start by sharing some highlights from the quarter. First quarter revenues grew 5.5% over the prior year period demonstrating the continued execution of our successful growth strategy and putting us solidly on track to deliver to our top line growth targets for the year. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 10.1% were slightly better than our expectations. Strong program performance offset some of the impact we anticipated from the higher mix of early phase program revenues as we ramp up the new work from last year's awards. Non-GAAP diluted EPS in the quarter of $1.13 was up roughly 10% year-over-year, primarily reflecting a lower non-GAAP effective tax rate and a lower share count. Note that this excludes the gain on the sale of our commercial cyber business of $88 million. Operating cash flows were above seasonal levels reflecting earlier than expected advanced payments on certain programs. Investing cash flows of $237 million reflects the proceeds from several transactions that closed in the quarter. The transaction proceeds include $171 million from the sale of our commercial cyber business and $96 million from the sale of three of our buildings in Gaithersburg and San Diego. These transactions further the monetization of our balance sheet, when ongoing initiative which we continue to execute to drive increased return on invested capital. Combined, these items offset by our capital expenditures and the execution of our ASR increased our cash and equivalents balance over $200 million sequentially to $536 million at the end of the quarter. We continue to thoughtfully deploy excess cash against our stated capital deployment policy. Over the past 12 months, we have returned more than $800 million to shareholders. A quarter of that through our regular dividends and three quarters through our share repurchases. And before I turn to our segment results, I'd like to provide an update on the hiring given its importance to meeting our growth objectives. Our progress on this front has been great thus far this year. Despite the tight labor market, we've hired over to 2,000 new employees just in the first quarter, and we're on track to meet our headcount goals for the year. Our ability to ramp successfully on our new programs depends heavily on hiring the best available talent. We will continue to use our innovative programs to aggressively recruit top talent and maintain our growth momentum. Now for some highlights from our segment results. For the Defense Solutions segment, revenue growth accelerated significantly to 6.6% year-over-year growth compared to the prior quarter's level of 3.6% year-over-year growth. This strength reflects the continued expansion of our base business as we ramp up on our programs that we have won last year. Non-GAAP operating margin decreased 80 basis points from the prior year period due to a lower level of net profit write-ups. We booked $1.2 billion of net awards in the Defense Solutions segment resulting in a 1.0 book-to-bill for the quarter were 1.3x on a trailing 12 month basis. In our Civil segment, first quarter revenues reflect a typical seasonal sequential decline compounded by the effect of the government shutdown and the sale of our commercial cyber business. These factors depressed the otherwise strong year-over-year growth in the business as we continue to ramp up the new programs that we won last year. A higher mix of early phase program revenues combined with a lower level of net profit write-ups drove the year-over-year decline in non-GAAP operating margins to 11% for the quarter. Civil generated $550 million in net bookings resulting in a book-to-bill for the quarter of 0.7x or 0.9x on a trailing 12 month basis. While typically a light quarter for bookings for Civil, this quarter did see some impact from the delayed bookings and award activity as a result of the government shutdown. Turning now to our Health segment. Revenues in the quarter grew significantly, up nearly 9% year-over-year, reflecting the ramp of deployment activity on the DHMSM program and a higher level of on contract growth in other areas of the business. Non-GAAP operating margins in our Health business were 11.9% in the quarter. And despite a 60 basis point year-over-year decline, margins continue to be accretive to the overall company. The year-over-year decline primarily reflects the lower level of net profit write-ups as well as the return to a more normalized margin profile on certain programs, which we have discussed previously. Our Health segment saw a very strong bookings in the quarter, which drove a book-to-bill of 3.3x. Net bookings primarily reflected an increase to expected volume of services based on modifications received on existing programs. Overall, the growth achieved in all of our businesses furthers our confidence in our strategy and our ability to deliver to our guided targets. Before I discuss our forward outlook, I'd like to spend a moment discussing the impact of the new lease standard ASC 842 to our financial statements. The primary impact of the new standard, which we adopted during the quarter, is that requires the presentation of operating leases on the balance sheet. As such, beginning this quarter, you will find two new light line items on our balance sheet, an operating lease right-of-use asset of $406 million and our long-term operating lease liabilities of $305 million. The short-term portion of operating lease liabilities is reflected within accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Additional details are provided in Note 4 of our 10-Q. Importantly, the adoption of this standard has an immaterial impact on both the P&L and the statement of cash flows. With that I'll move now onto our forward outlook. First, as a result of the $200 million accelerated share repurchase executed in the first quarter, we are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance range by $0.05 to a range of $4.30 to $4.65. Second, on the strength of our results so far in the year-end and reflecting our expectation of ongoing balance sheet monetization items, we are increasing our operating cash flow guidance by $100 million to at or above $825 million for the full year. And finally, we are also updating our CapEx view for the year to reflect an incremental investment of approximately $40 million for program-related assets. We expect this investment will ultimately be fully recovered through margin accretive program revenues in 2020 and beyond. We have occasionally made such investments and where it makes good financial sense we will continue that practice. And as a result of the investment, we expect CapEx of approximately $175 million for the full year inclusive of the real estate related assets previously disclosed. The detail on this is again included in Slide 10 of our earnings presentation. Guidance for revenue and adjusted EBITDA margins will remain unchanged. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Brock, so we can take some questions. Operator : Thank you, sur. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Rob Spingarn : Hi, good morning. Roger Krone : Good morning. Jim Reagan : Hi, Rob. Rob Spingarn : Good numbers, guys, especially the top line growth, the consistency there. I wanted to start though with the margins. And you mentioned lower margins on recompetes as a driver the decline in the Health operating margin? And I wanted to get a sense of how that profiles going forward? Do these margins go up over time, or is this just reflective of the pricing on these big contracts? Jim Reagan : Hey, Rob. This is Jim. Thanks for jump into today. In prior periods, we've talked about one of our programs in the Health business rolling off and into a recompete. That had previously been delayed, which is why for a couple of quarters last year, we had margins in the Health business that were higher than what we had kind of set up as an expectation. That recompete has cycled through. And as a result, I think that the margins that we're seeing now, we can expect to be relatively flat through the year. Rob Spingarn : Okay. And then, just I think Roger called that DHMSM or maybe it was you Jim, how do we think about DHMSM and then the VA contract in terms of where they are in \u2013 with regard to their ramp? When should we see each plateau? And to what extent are these driving these bigger book-to-bills? Roger Krone : Okay, Rob, I'll start off, there's like three parts to that. First of all, this is a year of ramp for DHMSM and we've talked about that literally for years. And we're in Wave 1 and we will start what is the second wave, although we collect wave 4 in the fall, and that will allow us to ramp the program, again as we've talked about before. The VA program, we are a smaller piece of that. And again, it's not our program kind of refer you to the prime on that program. And there were some events and some mods in the period that allowed us to books some backlog on DHMSM, and I'll turn it over to Jim for any further comments on that. Jim Reagan : Yes, just in terms of the book-to-bill that we saw in the Health Group, Rob, again 3.3x. A piece of that came from the DHMSM program, where as a result of a contract mod that we've received, it gives us much better definitization and visibility of the rest of the program and that resulted in a nice slug of additional bookings. Rob Spingarn : Is there a way to quantify where these two programs are as a percentage of the $2 billion or so you're doing annually in the Health business, and where they'll peak? Jim Reagan : Yes. We don't guide to segments and you've heard us talk about that before, but \u2013 and we haven't previously, and I don't know if you want to get in the habit of talking about DHMSM and the VA programs in terms of with any precision, what kind of percentage they are of the overall Health business. But I would point out that there is other work that we're executing on in the VA, and within Social Security and with CMS and we consider the Health business is being more than just DHMSM and the VA-EHR program, it is something we are executing very well on across all of the Health segment. Rob Spingarn : Okay, thank you. I'll jump back in. Jim Reagan : Great, thanks, Rob. Roger Krone : Thanks, Rob. Operator : The next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Thanks so much and good quarter. You mentioned EACs, how did the EACs compare relative to last year? Jim Reagan : What you heard of \u2013 say in the commentary, Cai, is that across all of our segments we had lower net EAC write-ups than we did in Q1 a year ago. We had a lot of EAC true-ups a year ago that had up graft in margin. That was more notable in Q1, certainly than it is now. And the level of EAC write-ups, while it is lower than a year ago, it is consistent with the numbers that we had modeled when we provided the forward-looking guidance. And there is some \u2013 we will have more detail and the notes to the financials on what those write-ups look like by group. Cai von Rumohr : Okay. And turning to your bookings potential, maybe update us on when you expect the protest to expire on NEST? And any the large bookings decisions that are coming up GSM-O, Hanford and NextGen are? Thanks. Roger Krone : Let's see. Let's see we can cover those in order. We think hopefully NASA NEST\u2019s will be in the month of June, assuming it's the 90 day or 99-day period. Cai, as we all know those things are a little bit unpredictable, but our hope is that we'll reconcile that. We actually have a second smaller opportunity that's also in protest. I think it's with the air force. That's probably a month behind that. And then our sort of three large programs, Navy NextGen, the contractors all bid in the first quarter. So you can expect sort of a mid-year decision. And if there's a protest behind that, then it's pushing the end of the year. It's been \u2013 how those things go may or may not, actually be booked by any one this year. And then for us, we have Hanford and GSM-O, or the Global Solutions Management-Operations program. Hanford, again, we are submitted on that with probably later in 2019 and that could be subject to a protest. And then GSM-O is sort of on the same schedule, where which probably in the fall, and again another large multi-billion dollar program that one could expect to be protested. So it's interesting NextGen, Hanford and GSM-O, although all three may get awarded this year, Cai. I think it's likely that those bookings may push into next year, because of protest. But, of course, if they're not protested then the winner will bill out of book then this year. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you very much. Roger Krone : Yes. Operator : The next question is from Shelia Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Shelia Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Jim Reagan : Hi, good morning. Shelia Kahyaoglu : Just on the pipeline. Just a follow-up on that, you mentioned $36 billion in bids. That's up from $28 billion last quarter. What's driving it, if you could give a little bit more color there? Roger Krone : Shelia, mostly the bids that I kind of just referred to, because they are we don't quite tell you what the bid price was, but they are currently in the multi-billion dollars. And so it was a \u2013 although the usual volume, also I think some awards certainly in civil are probably delayed because of the shutdown. So there's a little bit of accumulation of pipeline there. But it was these large Navy NextGen, Hanford and GSM-O that when you're bidding multiple billion dollars awards. That's what drives the pipeline up so high. But where $36 billion is a record high for us and is kind of an unbelievable number given those of us who've been on this journey for a while, that's kind of exciting, it's a little bit amazing that what this team has been able to do. Shelia Kahyaoglu : Okay, got it. So just the sequential probably more Navy NextGen than anything else. And then, I appreciated the color on the headcount, I think you increased headcount by 6% this quarter. Just any more color there what areas are you hiring in is the sense of demand, or just timing of when the workforce is coming in? If you could give a little bit more on that. Thank you. Jim Reagan : Yes. Shelia, what I would \u2013 this is Jim, what I would tell you is that when you're growing nicely across all the segments, particularly as we think about the ramp up of DHMSM in the Health Group, we think about the ramp up of the ASIT award in the Civil Group, which we won last year in the second quarter. We're continuing ramping on that. We have a large DOE program that we won last year. And then, of course, we've won a nice slug of classified contracts over in the Defense Solutions segment. All of these are requiring us to be adding headcount. And so, when we talk about the 2,000 heads \u2013 2,000 associates and employees we've hired across the business there \u2013 across all of our business segments. Shelia Kahyaoglu : Okay. Thank you for the color. Jim Reagan : Thanks, Sheila. Operator : The next question is from Krishna Sinha of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Krishna Sinha : Hi, thanks. Real quick, what were the advanced payments that you guys booked this quarter, like can you size those for us? Jim Reagan : Well, I would call over a couple hundred million dollars, and the beauty of that you've heard us talk about those in other parts of our business \u2013 various parts of our business. And we \u2013 as soon as we think about them are kind of moving back off the balance sheet, we get another advance payment from a different customer. So these particularly run in the health part of our business, and they're going to run and stay on the balance sheet, roughly half of them will be on the balance sheet still at the end of the year. So it really helps us move the needle on \u2013 it does help us move the needle on our non-cash working capital deployment. We were thinking of those in our full year guidance, and it just happened earlier in the year than we expected them to. Krishna Sinha : Got you. And then on the top line, you guys had previously talked about kind of a back-half weighted top line acceleration this year. This quarter, obviously, was much better than expected. So can you just talk about what the cadence is throughout the rest of the year now? Is it still more back half-weighted, or should we see a little bit more level loading of revenue growth throughout the year to hit that 5% kind of growth target? Jim Reagan : Yes, the way we had thought about this before is that it was going to be dependent upon hiring that we expected to be somewhat delayed until the second quarter. Our hiring results starting early in this quarter really the back end of Q4 last year enabled us to pull some revenue in from the back end of the year and bring it forward. So that it makes the hockey stick, not so much a hockey stick. And so we've got the backlog there. We now have the people to execute on it. And it gives us like we've said more confidence in our guided targets on the top line. Roger Krone : Yes. And Krishna, I would also add, we were recovered from shutdown, perhaps better in first quarter than we anticipated when we put our full year guidance out and close the year. We were just literally a couple weeks out of the shutdown and the customers were good about getting our people back to work. And so, we were able to better balance the four quarters. Krishna Sinha : Great. And then, finally on headcount, you mentioned sort of a headcount goal to hit your growth numbers this year. First, that 2,000 heads that you hired this quarter, is that a net number? So does that include any attrition that you had? And then, secondly, how are you trending now in terms of headcount growth to hit that 5% growth number? I mean, I guess, how many more additional heads will you have to hire from here to hit that number for the full year? Jim Reagan : Well, the 2,000 is a gross number, and it covers the need to hire people for programs that are growing, but also to cover our attrition. And think of the net number is being over 600. It puts us on a pace to hire the number that we need to execute on our top line growth expectations. We don't guide to headcount numbers, but think about the total number will need will be hiring at the same pace we did in Q1. Krishna Sinha : Got you. That's great. I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks guys. Jim Reagan : All right. Thanks, Krishna. Operator : The next question comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Gavin Parsons : Hey, this is Gavin on for Noah. Good morning, everyone. Roger Krone : Yes, Gavin, good morning. Gavin Parsons : Maybe just a quick follow-on on the headcount question. What kind of growth leverage can you get over and above the percentage growth rate of headcount? Jim Reagan : Gavin, if I understand your question correctly, it is the way I think about the way you're asking it is, when we're adding these level of people to help us manage direct programs, and these are either people who are direct on program fully billable. Do we need to add any overheads commensurate with that, the notion that we've had since we combined with IS&GS is once we get the efficiencies and the synergies, the cost synergies executed, which we have our ability to leverage the business as we grow the top line is really, really strong. So we view the level of overhead \u2013 non-billable overhead to be relatively small. Now with that said, as we grow the top line, it does enable us to absorb more costs in terms of growing the business. So it enables us to spend more on future growth initiatives more R&D, more hire ads and more marketing in B&P dollars. Roger Krone : Yes, Gavin, I heard maybe a second part to that question, which is how much is our own value added and then how much is material and major suppliers? And although, every contract is different. And we strive to have more and more Leidos content in all of our bids. If you think about our content being maybe normally in the 60%-ish, so that when we hire a person, it's not quite two-to-one on growth, but there is a multiplier effect when we add people, because with that contract comes a material suppliers and other partners. So it's not a one-to-one on people, it's actually better than one-to-one. Gavin Parsons : That's really helpful. You talked about the \u2013 you actually sound a pretty positive on the budget, but mentioned your expectations for CR to start next year. Last year, I think you had mentioned, maybe some agencies weren't as willing to spend their actual budget dollars, the actual growth in budget dollars, is the customer more confident in the spending environment? Do you expect the CR to be little bit less disruptive this year than it might typically be? Roger Krone : Yes, probably positive on both of those points, given we actually see a way to maybe a small CR, and then a full budget for both on the defense and on the non-defense side that more agencies are looking at, but I'm hopeful we'll see a two-year deal get us on the other side of the presidential elections. So agencies are now starting to spend and they're balancing the near-term readiness versus long-term spend. And of course, the President and Congress are meeting on infrastructure. We're probably as we speak and we view that as a net positive. The CR is always a little bit of dampening, but kind of what we're hearing is, we will probably get a budget and the numbers on the defense side look to be in sort of like the 730s and the non-defense seems to be about 600, low 630s. And with \u2013 if it's a two-year deal with about 3% growth in the out-year for 2021. It's one of the better budget environment. So I think that we all have seen in a long time, and if we can lock in a two-year deal and get us through the presidential politics, it really stabilizes the spending from our customers standpoint get as far into 2021 and 2022. Gavin Parsons : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : The next question comes from Tobey Summer of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Tobey Summer : Thank you. From a broad perspective, looking at the company as a whole, how much of the business is now sort of products or services were tethered to an wrapped around the product versus what your multi-year vision maybe for the company? Roger Krone : Yes. I'll talk a little bit and then Jim, he made out the exact numbers, but let me restate. First and foremost, we tend to be very, very mission aligned. And so, we look at contracts where we go in with a customer we partner in the execution of their agencies mission or even in healthcare. If you think of what we do for Department of Health Affairs, their mission is to provide healthcare to the active military and our opportunity is to team with them and make their electronic healthcare records more efficient. Our products come into play, where they help us to make the mission faster, better or cheaper. And we do like product content, we do reasonable amount of electronic fab. Obviously, in our baggage and vehicle inspection programs that we do CBP and TSA, there's more manufacturing content there. And I know, recently we have said that we are comfortable with products and we are comfortable with what I would call relatively light kind of electronic fab manufacturing. And we would be pleased to see that grow just as a balance in our portfolio, but it's always going to be along the line of helping our customer to achieve a mission. I think there was something that was written, I may have said a week or two ago that's as you know, we don't expect us to be like in the ground vehicle business as a standalone product. We make some controls in displays. We make some small communications equipment. Those are the kind of things that we like to do. Of course, we have this product we call Sea Hunter, which is an autonomous ship, if you think about that that is the Navy surface autonomous mission, and what we really bring to that is the autonomous technology and then to build the ship what we don't actually own a shipyard, we go into the market and try to find an appropriate shipyard and team with them. And if you will use their shipyard for the construction of the ship. And then when we're done, we don't have the shipyard in our portfolio that we have to worry about keeping full. So that's kind of our view of products. I don't know whether Jim wants to add to that or not. Jim Reagan : Yes, I think, Roger said it well. If you're thinking about today how much of our revenue is driven by strict manufacturing is relatively small. And when we talk about our comfort level with being more into manufacturing, it's typically like Roger said, light manufacturing and prototyping. And usually it's in conjunction with services that were performing on customer mission. And this enables us to help more with services and product and hardware integration more than thinking about us having a factory, that's not where we're going. Tobey Summer : Sure. As you look at hiring strategically and also just this year, are you hiring a disproportionate modest outside of the DC Metro area? I'm trying to get a sense for mix, because we know that the tight labor market seems to come up with investors from time to time. Roger Krone : We certainly have an emphasis on that. And we have a software factory, if you will, in Morgantown, West Virginia, we're building another one in Charlottesville. We're doing a significant software now in Denver, Colorado Springs and San Diego. We still have some customers who want our team think of it within 50 miles of their facility and that puts some constraints on where we hire. And so there's always this emphasis in the national capital region. But we are seeing, I won't call it a seachange, but we are seeing more flexibility on behalf of customers for us to move the work to where we can hire people, and of course the biggest example of that is one of our larger customers, the National Geospatial Agency is actually building a \u2013 I wouldn't call it a second headquarters, but a second large facility in St. Louis, Missouri. And of course, St. Louis is a terrific place to hire people. There is some great schools there and they're actually building what's called NGA West in the downtown area, where a lot of millennials and people want to live. And then as they build that facility, obviously, we have a significant presence in St. Louis today, we've a really great team there. And we will bet, we will be adding to that team and what we hope to do is to hire locally from St. Louis University and Wash U and UMSL other schools in that region. Tobey Summer : Thank you. Roger Krone : Yes. Operator : The next question comes from Joe DeNardi of Stifel. Please go ahead. Jon Ladewig : Hey, guys, this is Jon on for Joe. Good quarter. I was hoping you could talk about the awards environment both on the Defense and Civil sides. And along that lines kind of how we should think about the cadence of for civilian for the next two quarters? Roger Krone : Let me answer what I think you're asking \u2013 feel free to follow-up with a clarification. Let me start with the last question. On civil, we were on track for some relatively significant awards. And then Civil was most impacted by the shutdown. And I can't speak to how disruptive the shutdown is on our customer. And things that might have been in the pipeline and on track, the shutdown may have only been a couple of weeks, but it's a start-stop and that delays and frankly by quarters some of the civil awards. And so we will see some things move to the right in Civil. That being said, if I were to characterize the overall environment, we are seeing our customers getting things through the pipeline. And we've got normally 18 months until we have the same administration or different administration. So I think a lot of our customers are going, we need to get this stuff out under contract and started before we have a potential change at administration. And as a result, we're seeing a lot of this stuff now start to come through. There's I think efficiency initiatives almost across the board and trying to think of new ways, what we call other transaction agreements 804s, 845s, 809s, and how to get things under contract. So the environment writ large is a positive one with a little bit of a delay in Civil because of the shutdown. Jim Reagan : Yes. The other thing I would say about the Civil, remember that we're pleased to have been awarded NASA NEST program, looking forward to the get their resolution of that protest. And with that, we'll see \u2013 we're expecting to post a pretty nice book-to-bill and revenue number, revenue growth opportunity in the Civil business, and looking forward to getting the decision sometime late this year on Hanford. Jon Ladewig : Okay. Thanks for the color, guys. Just one last question. On M&A, you're seeing some new entrants, the latest one being Jacobs, and it's a reason to bid for KeyW. Does this change your approach to M&A? And does it change your approach to looking at the industry overall and perhaps expanding into adjacent markets? Thank you. Roger Krone : Let's see. First of all, I think we have seen \u2013 we and the industry has seen Jacobs broaden and diversify their portfolio. So I don't see whether it's Jacobs or KBR or AECOM. I don't see that is a change, I think it is a trend. And honestly, it really speaks to the excitement around our strategy, we like where we're, we're not surprised that others want to be here. And we think it's an attractive market, it's got both long-term positive aspects for top line and bottom line. It doesn't change the way we think about M&A. We were very fortunate and able to get our deal done about three years ago. We're fully integrated on that. We now think about our Company and our markets as where do we want to be; what supports our strategy; we want to be thoughtful and careful and the moves that we make; we're always looking for intrinsic value. But we have used the word M&A more so recently than we had maybe two years ago when we were heavy into integration. And if we find something that enhances our strategy and provides capability or access to our customer that we don't have, then clearly we have the balance sheet to be able to play. But that being said, we're going to be thoughtful and look for properties that are important to us and that meet our long-term strategy. Operator : The next question comes from Justin Donati of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Justin Donati : Hi, this is Justin on for Ed. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one I had, can you talk a little bit about contract mix. If you were able to grow fixed price a little bit faster than cost plus or time and materials this quarter and kind of over the last 12 months? Jim Reagan : Yes. This is Jim. Justin, right now the mix between cost plus and fixed is relatively consistent with what we saw last year in 2018. It's probably actually the fixed price and T&M pieces, maybe dropped by a percentage point, which we don't think of that as being material and that move \u2013 can move around a little bit through the year. So right now, we like to be able to shape new opportunities to be more outcome based, which we believe is good for customers, it's good for the company and gives us an opportunity to expand margins, but moving that needle isn't something that goes really fast in this business. So I think that right now you can think of us as having the same mix going forward just at least in 2019. Justin Donati : Okay. And kind of jumping on just a few of the questions have been asked earlier. But are you seeing all of your clients kind of spending to their full appropriations levels,? Or in the federals segment are some clients kind of holding back on some of that spend? Roger Krone : Yes, I'm not sure I would say holding back. I think some organizations are just more efficient and faster at turning authorizations in appropriations into procurements and others are slower. The Pentagon is a fairly mature organization in getting things purchased and their emphasis that we've seen out of Secretary Shanahan and the acquisition execs in the services is to accelerate that. And some of the work on other transactions authorities and moving fast have really come from the three services, which now have acquisition authority. And so we've seen encouragement there. As we go around all the other agencies, FAA, NASA, Department of Energy, it's a mixed bag as to how fast they're moving. But there is \u2013 nothing that is slower, right. So I think all the agencies are trying to move faster, some are just better at it than others. Justin Donati : Great. I appreciate the color. And then just the last one for me. Now that the commercial cyber sale is done. Can you provide any kind of color on how much of the headwind that's going to be for you year-over-year? Jim Reagan : Yes, you can think of it on a full year basis or full-year run rate basis is roughly a point of growth. Justin Donati : Great, thank you. Jim Reagan : Okay. Operator : The next question comes from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Jim Reagan : Hey, Hi, Rob. Rob Spingarn : Hi, I just wanted to come back and ask you about the record level of submits the pipeline. I know you explained at Navy Air Systems some other things are behind this pretty sizable jump from the fourth quarter. But in general, I wanted to see if you have a sense or some context, now that you've closed the merger and we've talked about revenue synergies in the past. How do we think about the bid pipeline expanding from here? Assume it should outgrow the budget. Is that fair? Roger Krone : Well, for a while, couple of points we made at the merger was, we wanted to use our size and scale to go after larger jobs. And we have done that. And in fact, if we had to choose a $5 million kind of a program with the customer versus their $1.5 billion program. We definitely want to make sure that we are fully pursuing the large multi-billion dollar program. There is a point where we will continue to expand as we grow our top line and we grow our ability to generate new business funds and our marketing dollars. And we're not there yet, but there will be a point where growth in our pipeline will mean to go to adjacencies and agencies that maybe we are not, where we don't have a presence with today. But we're not quite there yet. We're taking this kind of one year at a time and we plot through what are the agencies planning on doing, like the Army is rethinking how they procure IT. And so we're having discussions with the army on what that would look like, that's likely to be multi-billion. And so there's still plenty of pipeline that we can go chase in the addressable markets that we have today. Rob Spingarn : Okay. And then just the other question I had was on the headcount. You mentioned that there is operating leverage there. So on net headcount increase, what should we be thinking for the year against your 5.5% or your 5% sales goal? Jim Reagan : And just in terms of headcount increase, I think that you can think of the net-net, we're looking to increase headcount between 5% and 6.5%. That's going to depend a lot on how execution mix goes in terms of the programs that are ramping, and how much of their content is subcontracted versus requiring our own heads. Rob Spingarn : So could it out grow sales at that level at the high end? Jim Reagan : I think that you probably think of it as being in pace with sales, rather than outgrowing it, because as we've said, there's got to be a little bit of operating leverage at play there, Rob. Rob Spingarn : Right, right, which is why I figured it would be a lower number than sales growth. Although, I guess the timing of the additions has a lot to do with it as well. Jim Reagan : Yes, as I said, the other part of it is that to the extent that we're able to grow with an increasing share of the revenue content being from Leidos employees as opposed to subcontracted, that could put some upward pressure on headcount number, which for us is a good thing, that enables us to take part of that gross margin and plow it back into things that will grow the business. Rob Spingarn : Okay, thank you. Roger Krone : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Krishna Sinha of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Krishna Sinha : Hi, thanks for taking the follow-up. So just a question on margin trajectory. Obviously, DHMSM some has a pretty large subcontractor component and you can't put fee on fee. So as that ramps during the wave phase. Does that put downward pressure on margins, and if that does then what are you expecting in terms of margins from contribution from your other segments? I mean is that going to trend upwards? Is that your expectation over the next few years as DHMSM ramps up in order to keep you above your sort of 10% adjusted EBITDA margin target bogey? Jim Reagan : Yes, no, I understand the question. As DHMSM grows, the margin profile for that program will remain consistent. So we should not be thinking, you should not be thinking of the growth in the DHMSM program is putting downward pressure on margins. Krishna Sinha : I understand that margins for that program will stay the same, but are the margins for that somewhat lower than your overall say corporate margin? And therefore, I'm just throw numbers out there, like let's say it's 9% margin for DHMSM and your bogey for the whole company is 10%. I mean as that grows and becomes a bigger part of everything, how does that not put downward pressure on the rest of the corporate margins? Jim Reagan : The answer is no, Krishna, because the margin on the DHMSM program at the operating income level as it grows will be in line with the average for the rest of the company. Krishna Sinha : Okay, that's great. Thank you. Jim Reagan : All right. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'll now hand the call back over to Kelly Hernandez for closing remarks. Kelly Hernandez : Thank you, Brock, and thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to sharing more with you about our businesses and our long-term strategy in a couple of weeks at our Investor Day on May 14. The event will be webcast live for those of you who cannot join us in person. Thank you again, and have a great day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. At this time, I will now turn the conference over to Kelly Hernandez from Investor Relations. Ms. Hernandez, you may begin. Kelly Hernandez : Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the Leidos management team. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter ending June 28, 2019. Roger will lead off the call with notable highlights from the quarter as well as comments on the market environment and our Company strategy. Jim will follow with a discussion of our financial performance and our guidance expectations. After these remarks from Roger and Jim, we'll open the call for your questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, during the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in the press release that we issued this morning and is also available in the presentation slides. The press release and presentation as well as the supplementary financial information file are provided on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.leidos.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone. Roger Krone : Thank you, Kelly. And thank you all for joining us this morning for our second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Our growth momentum continues to accelerate through the second quarter with nearly 9% organic revenue growth, a record backlog position and strong win rates. Our success in executing against our pipeline and driving growth across all segments of our business enables us to raise our full-year guidance for both revenue and earnings. In addition, our recently announced dividend increase demonstrates the confidence of the Board of Directors and the management team and the strength of the company's cash flow generation and ability to sustainably generate value for our shareholders. Importantly, we achieved key wins during the quarter that increased our backlog to $21.7 billion, reaching a record level that also serves as a leading indicator of our future growth potential. These successes resulted from our strategic focus on delivering innovative solutions to our customers and leveraging the scale of our organization, a couple of highlights from the quarter's awards. We successfully defended a protest on our takeaway win with NASA's End-User Services & Technologies program or NEST. Under this contract Leidos will provide, managed, secure and maintain essential IT services that support the agency's core business, scientific, research and computational abilities. The single award contract has a total potential value of over $2.9 billion over the ten-year period of performance. We also successfully defended a protest on another takeaway win with the Air Force Air Combat Command to support the war fighters intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance mission through intelligence gathering, analysis, distribution and training across the ACC enterprise. This single award task order has a total ceiling value of approximately $900 million if all options are exercised. Business development remains a key priority of the company's strategy and we have transformed it into a cross functional and collaborative effort. I'm proud to see us hitting our stride and winning the important work with key customers. During the quarter, we continue to focus on leveraging the strong revenue growth to generate more cash. We successfully converted a 100% of non-GAAP net income to free cash flow and exited the quarter with $660 million in cash and equivalents on hand. As we continue to evaluate options for deploying our excess capital in line with our stated capital deployment philosophy, we announced yesterday the company's first ever dividend increase. The 6% increase to the dividend is effective with the September payment and raises our quarterly dividend from $0.32 to $0.34 per share. This increase reflects confidence in our long-term performance and reinforces our commitment to delivering strong returns to shareholders. We remain committed to thoughtfully deploying our excess capital in line with our stated capital's appointment philosophy which balances our investments for growth including organic and M&A with returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The strong revenue growth and positive momentum in our business has driven a positive impact on our hiring and retention efforts. During the quarter, we added a net 1200 new employees to our organization increasing our total headcount to more than 33,000. The takeaway wins in particular are helping our hiring efforts into the clear domain being able to transfer cleared personnel directly into the Leidos family helps alleviate some of the tightness in the cleared labor market. While it still takes significant time to move our new employees through the clearance process, we are encouraged by the progress made by the National Background Investigative Bureau in reducing the clearance backlog. While there's still room for improvement, we're seeing early results of the targeted effort by the Bureau to reduce the backlog awaiting clearance. We are excited to welcome all of our new employees and look forward to continuing to grow our organization to build on our customers trust and support them with their most critical missions. Continuing with the people theme, I want to highlight a couple of refinements we have made to our executive leadership team during the quarter. I am pleased to announce the promotion of Jim Carlini to the position of Chief Technology Officer for the Company. Prior to joining the Company in 2018 Jim spent decades in technical leadership roles throughout government, academia and industry including having served as the Director of the Special Programs Office at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or DARPA. Jim is also a member of the Defense Science Board and was previously Vice President of advanced development programs at Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems. Jim will continue to drive technical excellence throughout the enterprise ensuring differentiate solutions in critical technology areas ranging from artificial intelligence and machine learning to cyber defense, to rapid and secure delivery of mission-critical software. He will also lead the effort to leverage the cutting-edge capabilities incubated in the Leidos innovation center, the Link, throughout the business to deliver solutions to customers in all of our served markets. Jim takes over the role from Jim Cantor who has moved into a newly created position of Chief of Performance, Excellence and Strategic Partnerships. In this role Jim will be responsible for enhancing our strategic supplier framework and driving the Leidos business framework, principles throughout all program operations. Turning now to the macroenvironment, conditions continue to remain quite favorable. The recent passage in the house of the Bipartisan Budget Act and the expected approval by the administration in Senate is positive for our business. The bill allows for stable predictable and large defense and discretionary budgets for two more years; government fiscal year 2020 and 2021. Although appropriations are still outstanding, the overall budget growth of 3% in defense and 4.5% in non-defense provide a supportive foundation for the continued growth of our business. The key priorities embedded in the National Defense Strategy remain unchanged and continue to tightly align with our core capabilities and our ability to provide innovative solutions to help our customers execute on their most critical missions. As we look ahead and I previously mentioned, the strength of our results through the halfway point in the year combined with continued tailwinds we see in the market landscape give us confidence to raise both our revenue and earnings expectations for the full year. Jim will provide details of the revised guidance in a moment. Before I hand the call over to Jim, as we did last quarter, we again want to spotlight some of the social and community initiatives we engage in as a company. This quarter I want to highlight the progress that we have made and our efforts to help resolve the nationwide opioid epidemic, the scale of which is alarming. In response to difficult times some of our own employees have experienced with family members affected by this epidemic. Leidos launched the CEO pledge which encourages business leaders to create and nurture work environments that are safe for conversations about addictions, to educate employees about the potential dangers of opioids and to support nonprofit organizations focused on additional prevention and recovery. I'm pleased to report that to-date more than 60 CEOs from organizations across the country have demonstrate their commitment to ending the epidemic by signing the CEO pledge and making changes in their organizations to support employees throughout this crisis. There is still much work to be done and our goal is to have at least 100 signatories. Well, I'm proud to share this initiative with you as we recognize that all of us can share in helping to navigate this growing health concern in the communities where we live and work. In conclusion, we remain focused on delivering innovative solutions to our customers by leveraging the strength of our scale. We continue to focus on leveraging our success with customers to generate cash in the business. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer for more details on our second quarter results and guidance. Jim Reagan : Thanks, Roger. And thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. In summary, we've achieved continuing strong execution across all of our segments. Our revenue growth of 8.8% over the prior year is the highest organic growth we've seen in several years driven by new program win and accelerated on contract growth. We were able to deliver the strong growth while maintaining adjusted EBITDA margins of 10.0% in line with our long-term targets. Lower profit write-ups were the primary driver of the year-over-year margin compression. This is reflective of our revenue composition that is more heavily weighted to early phase programs as we have discussed previously. Non-GAAP diluted EPS increase $0.04 over the prior year to $1.16 primarily driven by the lower share count resulting from our sharing purchases over the past year. Operating cash flows were $186 million reflecting 110% conversion of non-GAAP net income. We had another great quarter on the business development front booking over $3 billion in net awards into our backlog including significant contribution from takeaway wins. Takeaways in new business represented nearly 70% of the bookings for the quarter and more than 60% of bookings year to-date. Our ending backlog of $21.7 billion is up 18% over the past year and 27% over the past two years, highlighting the success of our business development strategy and our scale advantage. In the quarter, we submitted 10.3 billion of proposals which after accounting for some large decisions adjudicated in the period resulted in 30 billion in submit pending decision at quarter end. Now for an overview of our segment results. Defense solutions grew 6.7% over the prior year quarter as new program revenues more than offset program completion. Non-GAAP operating margins of 8.6% decline 20 basis points from the prior year largely related to the result of newer programs which carry lower margin in the early phase. Defense solutions also booked over $1.7 billion of net awards including a large takeaway win resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.3x for the quarter and on a trailing 12 month basis. In our civil segment; revenues grew 11% organically when adjusting for the sale of our commercial cyber business. This growth largely reflects our ramp-up of recent takeaway wins. Non-GAAP operating margins in our civil segment declined 40 basis points from the prior year due to lower net profit write-ups and a revenue composition that's more heavily weighted to early phase programs and materials. Civil segment bookings were very strong at $1.2 billion, reflecting a large takeaway award. The result was a book-to-bill of 1.3x for the quarter and 0.9x on a trailing 12 month basis. And finally our health segment; results here again showed strong growth with DHMSM deployments and expansion on other programs contributing to 11% revenue growth over the prior year. Non-GAAP operating margins of 14.4% in the health group were again very strong, but down from the prior year's level as the margin profile on certain recompete programs shifted to a more normalized levels that we have previously previewed with you. And from a bookings perspective, our health segment generated a little over a $100 million in net bookings and while this level is lower than the past its driven primarily by delays in the procurement process rather than by any reflection of win rates. Q2 decision volume was very low and we continue to have a healthy pipeline of awards awaiting decision which we expect to be resolved over the coming months. On a trailing 12 month basis health has a book-to-bill of 2.0x and remains very well-positioned in the market. To summarize, we're pleased with the performance across our entire business and as Roger mentioned we are updating our 2019 revenue and EPS guidance to reflect our strong results through the second quarter and increased second half visibility. First, we are raising and narrowing our revenue guidance to a range of $10.65 billion to $10.95 billion, an increase of $100 million at the midpoint from the prior range. Second, reflecting the higher revenue growth and slightly lower estimated net interest expenses, we're also raising and narrowing our earnings-per-share guidance. We now expect non-GAAP diluted EPS for the year to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.75 representing a $0.15 increase at the midpoint over the prior range. Our expectations were adjusted EBITDA margins and cash flow from operations remained unchanged. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob, so we can take some questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from the line of Shelia Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Shelia Kahyaoglu : Good morning and thank you. Just a big picture question for you Roger first, I think you mentioned the $30 billion pipeline this quarter. You had $36 billion, last quarter very large numbers. Maybe can you comment is this an overall industry trend where you're seeing bigger award sizing or is the consolidation resulting in more bids per program? Roger Krone : I really can't speak to what's going on with other companies. We have stated for a long time that we wanted to pursue larger programs and by growing and adding the scale that we have we now go after fewer programs but larger in the amount. And I will tell you for Leidos it is trend that we expect to continue. I think you have to go company-by-company to see what everybody else is doing. But -- and I think you had a second part which is sort of like is, do we see the customer aggregating or disaggregating. And it's interesting they kind of they go in waves, and we see them aggregate. And then we have another program that we've had for a long time which they're going to break into a couple pieces. Maybe NextGen is an example where the old NCMI was one contract and they're essentially going to break it into two. So it just comes and goes. But for us our strategy has been to go after larger programs. Shelia Kahyaoglu : Make sense. And then maybe a follow-up to that on NASA, NEST now that the protest is over. Can you give us any color on how we think about the ramp of the program, the potential to go to the high end of that, so I think $3 billion number and just a profit impact? Jim Reagan : Well, this is Jim, Shelia. Thanks for your question. I think that the best way to think about the ramp of NASA NEST is first of all, we take that into the bookings number by task order and that that will be something that is going to ramp over the next 12 to 18 months. The profit profile net program is pretty consistent with what our overall average is. We don't normally comment with very specific numbers on the profit margins on a program-by-program basis, but I think it's fair to say that you can think of the NASA NEST program is being relatively consistent. Shelia Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Thanks for the color. Jim Reagan : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions. Rob Spingarn : Hi. Good morning. Roger Krone : Hey, good morning, Rob. Rob Spingarn : So, Roger, I wanted to hone in on the growth here. It's obviously a theme in the sector. It's come on quite strong. You guys talked about it earlier. And at the same time I don't want to pour any water on this. But I wanted to reconcile your 3% to 4% type numbers that you referred to earlier with the fact that the budgets are beginning to flatten. I understand there's going to be some lag, but could you talk about your growth projections and your assessment of the market in the context of a FYDP that's kind of flattish especially when we look at this 2021 budget flat with 2020? Roger Krone : Yes. 3% for defense, 4.5% for non-defense and of course, we have to do the analysis underneath that and you have to look at two components. How long does it take budget to roll through the PBS system to become outlays? And that can often be 18 to 24 months. So when you get a strong budget in 2020 and 2021 it gives you momentum for a couple years. And then you then you have to dissect both the defense and the civil budget and look at where the spent is and what kind of accounts are growing and what accounts are shrinking. And we're seeing a lot of favorable movement for us, modernization, digital transformation move to the cloud, back office efficiencies, consolidation really across federal government with large. So \u2013 and we've always said there, the budget overall is going to be kind of bounded by that three, four percentages which just can't go up forever. But we're very pleased by the strength that we've had over the last couple of years, the strength going forward. And then where we see increases, obviously agent by \u2013 agency by agency and then accounts within those agencies. Rob Spingarn : Okay. And then on that could you maybe delve into some of the larger program opportunities and any roll-offs and perhaps you can comment I think maybe NextGen just came up but of course with the change in structure and the bit of a lag we talk about that one little bit? Roger Krone : Okay. I'll start with Navy NextGen which is NMCI. We are bidding on a portion of that called SMI TTY [ph] which really is more of the architecture in the network as opposed to buying the equipment where we had hoped that that would be up for award. I think the Navy has gone back and looked at their procurement and is making some adjustments to the solicitation and we expect that now probably will go to next year and that we won't see an award on Navy NextGen till 2020. That's my best guess at this time. Rob, we have two other large bids outstanding, I'll just touch on those, A Hanford Department of Energy recompete and we're hopeful that's within a couple weeks maybe one time it was supposed to be on the 29th, I actually think it's going to be a week or two behind that. And then our large infrastructure program at DISA, that we call the Global Support Management Organization or GSMO. And that is probably four weeks, six weeks-ish. We are still hopeful that there will be an award made probably in the third quarter and then you just have to think about protests and things from there, when that actually might enter into someone's backlog. Rob Spingarn : Okay. Anything going the other way? Anything rolling off way? Roger Krone : Well, of course, NASA NEST came off and so that hurt our submits, right, because it went from submits to award. We talked about ACC ISR, those are the big ones in the period. Rob Spingarn : Okay. Thank you very much. Roger Krone : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Thanks so much and good quarter. So NASA NEST and the ISR program, both are big but they both are IDIQ structure. How much did they actually contribute to your 3 billion of awards in the quarter? Jim Reagan : Cai, this is Jim. You can think of those contributing to the additional backlog is a little bit under $1 billion between the two of them. Cai von Rumohr : Got it. Okay. And then could you give us some color if we exclude GSMO, what's the booking environment that you're seeing kind of over the last couple of weeks in your anticipation of the third quarter which normally is a seasonal peak? Roger Krone : Well, Cai, we were pleased that -- really more to protest activity that we had a nice second quarter. And in fact, we still have the rest of the week to go in the month which is really third quarter, but looking at and July has been a good quarter, although we're still waiting to see how it ends. But you're absolutely right, third quarter has always been cyclical high, and we \u2013 I have no reason to believe that that would be any different. Again, we're pleased by the budget action and you just get a sense that a lot of the federal agencies really want to get decisions made before the end of the fiscal year. And now with budget certainty there is no reason for them to slow down. So, we expect most of these things to happen. Albeit, Navy NexGen is going to go through some revisions and I don't think I can be able to happen in fiscal year. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Edward Caso : Hi. Good morning. Congrats on another set of good numbers here. You mentioned good win rates. Could you frame that a little bit more sort of what levels and how much improvement? Thanks. Jim Reagan : Yes. Ed, as we've said before we don't give specifics on or details on win rates. But qualitatively the way we think about is that there's only been really one significant disappointment this year to-date on recompete other than that the recompete win rates has been kind of what we would really like in the main roughly with the exception of one thing if you curve that out its roughly high 80s around 90%. But things that's been most notable and the thing that I think can help contribute to both the current revenue growth being above what you would think of coming from normal budget increases, as well as our prospect for the rest of the year and into the future. It really has been our success in new business and takeaways and helping to get a little bit of -- or some nice share growth. And so, normally you think of takeaways is being kind of the converse of recompete, right? So, if you think of -- a lot of companies think of a good number for takeaways as being in somewhere between 20% and 30%. Our takeaway win rates have been well in excess of that and our new business win rates have also been well in excess of the 30% to 40% that I know a lot of companies target. So I'll leave it at that. Edward Caso : Great. My other question is, you mentioned strong net headcount adds, can you tell us a little bit more about your attrition and then split it sort of capital region and outside of the capital region? Thanks. Roger Krone : I think both Jim and I'll comment on that. Our attrition is cyclically down, it still not as low as we would like it to be. And it's really focused effort for us. We have broken it into what we call voluntary and involuntary and we have fought really really hard on what we call involuntary and that's when a contract comes to an end and we have trouble redeploying because of geography or skill set and we're really really working hard with our team, our leaders and our employees to more aggressively redeploying the employees. And then voluntary is down \u2013 not where were I think any of us would like it to be. And I would say, in the national capital region, probably the hottest market for the type of skills that we hire, but we have been pleased with our ability to hire people and to retain people and they are clearly isolated groups that do have a high level security clearance and you live in the Maryland area that's probably the hottest commodity. I think it's just going to remain that. We've had a strategy that we've talked about in the past of when the contract permits us to do the work beyond the 25 mile radius, then we move that work to other sites where our retention is higher and that has been successful for us. We have places in Morgantown, West Virginia and Charlotte -- Charlottesville and frankly St. Louis and Eagan, Minnesota were people tend to stay longer and enjoy the kind of work that we do. Edward Caso : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Sharp with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Matt Sharp : Good morning, gentlemen, a nice quarter. Roger Krone : Thank you. Matt Sharp : I just wanted to touch on the budget here for a moment, obviously going into 2019, it look like a CR was likely are going to play out in 4Q, but at this point where negotiations are with the Congress and the President that might no longer be in the cards. If we do get a deal prior to October 1, how does that impact 4Q revenue? Is there upside there or just \u2013 what's the playoff between revenue and the budget dynamics at this point? Roger Krone : Yes. Matt, I wouldn't say it's significant. I'm not even sure that you would adjust your model. I'll just talk about the behavior. If you're a government program manager and you have to operate under a CR you're really restricted in what you're going to do relative expanding your statement of work. And with an authorization bill and hopefully appropriations \u2013and by the way, I think, we will get most of the bills done. The DHS Bill may languish and may take a little longer, but I think they will spike that out. So it encourages what we call a normal order, which obviously has been anything, but normal, and people will now spend the money that they have been obligated. And I think it stabilizes, it gives us a slight lift, but I think it adds confidence and certainty to our third quarter, fourth quarter revenue. And it really let us look at the election season with a lot more confidence. There is going to be -- I think there's another debate tonight. There is just going to be a lot going on and the elections tend to be the sport in the U.S. And the good news is, we've taken sort of budget battles off the table, and that's great for our customers and their ability to do their mission and conduct the work of the nation. Matt Sharp : Got it. Thanks. And then, just a quick one on competition. Over the last couple of years, obviously, some of your peers have been playing catch-up in terms of scaling of their businesses, but at this point, there are some other notable names with substantial size. I was wondering if you're beginning to see elevated competition for some of the larger opportunities that they may now be able to pursue. Has there been a change in behavior or more names bidding on the same programs at this point? Roger Krone : Let's see. First of all, I would tell you that, it's always been very, very competitive marketplace. I mean it's just unbelievable and which is the world that we live in. In the five years that I've been here, it's always very, very difficult, and you really have to put your best foot forward. You have to be really, really good at presenting your technical story. I would say, because of consolidation, we have seen maybe the number of bidders, where it might have been five, now they are four, right, or maybe, it goes down to three especially for some bids, but that doesn't reduce the amount of competition. As I learned in my prior career, sometimes you only need two competitors to have really robust competition and we have found it here, but I wouldn't say, it's gotten worse, I think it is about where it has always been and it motivates us to come up with great solutions that are differentiated from our peers and to be able to articulate those well in the proposals that we write and present to customers. Matt Sharp : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Jon Raviv : Hey. Good morning. On capital allocation, so you've got the dividend increase, but repo was a bit late in the quarter, with your stock being at all-time highs and also you've previously highlighted M&A opportunities now that IS&GS is integrated. So I guess, big picture question on those, how are you evaluating organic versus inorganic versus repo at this point? Roger Krone : Jon, we've been maybe mind numbingly consistent in how we've talked about capital deployment. We've mentioned it in the prepared remarks and we'll do the same. We spend our first dollar internally on organic growth and we try to use that to support customer mission and we're always thinking about creative ways that we can do that. You saw a little increase in capital because we were able to deploy some of our balance sheet to support customers. We are, whatever active in M&A might mean, but just as we look at a lot of opportunities, we think that's a prudent thing for us to do. We're always thoughtful about how we spend your money. We want to make sure that we create long-term value that is sustainable, not just over a couple of years because with interest rates today, almost every deal is going to be accretive in the short-term. We want to make sure from like a DCS standpoint that we see true value. And we hope that there'll be some deals out there that will align for us, but if there isn't, then just we will return the capital in efficient ways to our owners. And as we've always said, that dividend is very, very important, couldn't be more pleased. We had to go back and check, but we found out we never actually increased the dividend. And so, it's kind of remarkable thing and hopefully everybody will enjoy that. And then, we have obviously been committed to share repurchases and that's in our toolbox as well. Jon Raviv : Okay. Thank you. And then, as you see growth opportunities really pick-up here, how does that change the way you consider where else you can spend the cash, specifically on investments in working capital, CapEx or some more internally funded R&D? Jim Reagan : Yes. Hi, Jon, this is Jim. We're always analyzing where we get the best return and we over the past 18 months we've increased our run rate on how much we spend on investments in new business funds, meaning marketing and bid and proposal cost. And in addition to that, part of that investment has made the deployment of that money much more efficient, so we're able to bid on more for the same amount of money. So we've had some nice returns on those investments. Getting to the inorganic side, I want to underscore what you -- I think, you just should have heard from what Roger said, which is that, our process to look at those opportunities is ongoing. We've got a team of people that's evaluating opportunities and it is in a very disciplined fashion. And so, you don't mistake the lack of meaningful M&A announcements from the Company, meaning that we're not actively looking and that you should not be surprised if you hear something from us in the coming six months on something that's strategic, it's meaningful, and it meets the financial criteria that we are going to continue to stick to before we undertake anything, any big transaction. And as Roger said, we will continue to keep share buybacks in our toolbox for capital deployment. Jon Raviv : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Joseph DeNardi : Good morning. Jim and Roger, you guys have sounded pretty bullish for the past several quarters. It seems like on your takeaway win success. I'm just wondering if you could probe a little bit deeper in terms of what's driving that, is it past performance, price kind of the tactical offering, where are you seeing the best performance there? And please don't say all three in your answer. Roger Krone : Yes. Okay. Let's just kind of go back and look at the journey that we've been on. When we were fortunate enough to close the IS&GS transaction, we talked a lot about being able to reset their cost structure of that traditional business. And so we would tell you that price. We were able by bringing them into our cost structure and then taking advantage of the combine scale. We've been able -- not that we never lose on price, but it is not the number one reason that we lose. And that helped -- that we saw an immediate shot. But what has really helped us is kind of going back to our roots, investing in what we call IRAD, winning CRAD from the SNC agencies that helped to develop technology that we then deploy against the larger programs, what we call the programs of record, which have fueled our growth. And every time we write a proposal, we ask ourselves the question, what are we offering the customer that is unique and differentiated to our offering. And then, we've got a great team behind that that continues to refresh the technology that we generate to help us create that differentiated offering. So, we want to win on our technical approach. That's the Company, that's the core of the culture that we have here, and we're now in a position where -- and by way, obviously, we don't win everything. There is always losses and there are losses I wish that we had won, but we are pleased with the improvements that we've made in our win rate based upon differentiated technology and I think that has been the difference for us. Joseph DeNardi : That's helpful. Thank you. And then, Jim, just from a recompete standpoint, is there anything to call out as unusual next year, or is it just the normal level? Thank you. Jim Reagan : It will be back to the normal level for next year. This year, we've got some of those big ones. You've heard about Hanford and GSMO earlier in the call, but we're not going to have nearly as many big lumpy recompetes that are going to be submitted next year like we do this year. Joseph DeNardi : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gavin Parsons with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Gavin Parsons : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Jim Reagan : Hey. Good morning, Gavin. Gavin Parsons : Hey. Guys, if you look out over the next few years, what would you say is the gating factor for your growth? Is it the amount of work you can win? Is it the rate at which you can hire? Is it the budget dollars that the government is able to get passed and how is that different than the last couple of years? Roger Krone : Well, it's not been win rate and it's not been ability to hire. What has been a great journey for all of us is our ability to address new markets and we've been able to do that with the addition of the IS&GS organization. They brought long history and long relationships with customers that Leidos didn't have. So that expanded our addressable market. And I think to maintain the clip, we have to continue to think about how do we continue to expand that addressable market, but not just to new customers, like new federal agencies, but within a federal agency that we've had a long relationship with to expand our offering across their directorships. And it's cross selling, so we've sold a capability to one agency and then how do we take the lessons learned from the work that we've done for that agency and use that to expand our offering at a second agency for which we have a relationship with, but we have not traditionally sold them that kind of a solution. But people, new business funds, our ability to win, our scale, we're nowhere near being constrained in those regards. Gavin Parsons : Got it. That's helpful. And I think we haven't talked about JEDI in a while. Just maybe any updated thoughts on the aspirations of non-traditional companies in the space, whether there the threat has increased or there is more opportunity in your view to partner with them on something like a JEDI roll out? Roger Krone : Yes. Well, of course, we're not a bidder on JEDI and our prediction is that JEDI will go forward and there'll be award made relatively soon. We have done digital transformation cloud hosting with all of the cloud providers. We work -- we have AWS certified people we have Azure certified people. I would say that we have great relationships with all of the offers and with the eventual customer. And we just see this as a way for our customers to reduce the cost right off IT spend and be able to change the tail ratio of the amount of money that the customer spends to operate their back offices by providing mission capable programs that further the goals and objectives of the agencies. So we're thrilled. And again, all the competitors have reached out. They look for mission partners like us to come in and help the customer better utilize their cloud hosting capability. Gavin Parsons : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tobey Summer with SunTrust Robinson. Please proceed with your question. Tobey Summer : Thanks. You commented a couple of times on questions about the size of contracts and competition. I was wondering at the segment level, if there is an echelon of contracts beyond the Company's easy reach now or you can attain everything you want at the scale you are in those segments? Roger Krone : Let me answer the question I think you asked, and if not, follow up. So, although you might view Leidos at the corporate level as having scale. The question is, in the four segments, are they large enough for which they also have scale, and therefore, are free to bid on any size of contract that they may see in a customer space? And the answer is, absolutely. And I would further comment, that's true in the U.S., it is also true in the United Kingdom and Australia, where we have significant operations and in a few other select countries, where we feel we have reach back and the scope and the scale that we can go after hundreds of millions and billions of equivalent U.S. dollar work. And what we have really strive to do at the Company is to create an environment where collaboration is natural. And so, if the Health Group feels like maybe in machine learning they don't quite have the depth that they need, they talk to the CTO and we have a CTO Council across the Company and they will seek out machine learning capability in the other groups and in the LInC, our Leidos Innovation Center, and they'll be able to pull that across. And that has really contributed to some of our success as of late, is the ability to leverage what all of Leidos knows in going after competitions. Tobey Summer : Thank you. Could you comment on the ramp and expected contour of GENESIS? And then, Roger, I was curious, could you also maybe tell us what is the pitch to prospective employees as to why they should choose Leidos as an employer? Roger Krone : Yes. Okay, great. And we're near the end. I'll try to go quick. First of all, on the GENESIS program, we are now actively involved in two wave deployments and by the way, they are no longer sequential. We've kind of changed the orders. So we're implementing a wave one and wave four. And so, we're fully involved and those wave four began last week of June. We expect to add another wave about every three months. And that means for the next probably three years, maybe more than that, we will have two waves ongoing. And so that says that we should see a ramp in 2019 and the peak activity occurring probably late 2021, or early 2022. We have agreed with the customer on the deployment schedule. That has been locked down. We've got a great team. Our DHA customer has been really, really supportive. We're making terrific progress. So that program is really hitting its stride. On why people come to Leidos? We like everything we do, we do surveys, we talk to employees on the way in. We also talk to employees who leave. We think there are three reasons that people come. First is, they love the nature of the work that we do. We have a mission. We support very, very important customers, most of which are at the national level, whether it be social security payments, national security, Intel organizations, transforming health in the United States, our employee love that. Second is, they love the professional environment and the people that they work with, so great people attract great people. It is a cycle that we just love. And then, the third is, they come here for professional development, the opportunity, our continuing reeducation programs, our certificate programs, the ability to grow their skill set, to be lifelong learners and to be rewarded for their performance, and frankly to see the growth of the Company, which creates opportunities to do more, to work on larger programs, to have more responsibility and eventually, to move up the organization and be a leader at Leidos. Tobey Summer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call over to Kelly Hernandez for closing remarks. Kelly Hernandez : Thank you, Rob. Thank you all for your time this morning and for your interest in Leidos. We look forward to updating you again next quarter. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I will turn the conference over to Kelly Hernandez with Investor Relations. Ms. Hernandez, you may now begin. Kelly Hernandez : Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our Third Quarter and 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the Leidos management team. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter ending September 27, 2019. Roger will lead off the call with notable highlights from the quarter as well as comments on the market environment and our company's strategy. Jim will follow with a discussion of our financial performance and our guidance expectations. After these remarks from Roger and Jim, we'll open the call for your questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, during the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in the press release that we issued this morning and is also available in the presentation slides. The press release and presentation as well as the supplementary financial information file are provided on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.leidos.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone. Roger Krone : Thank you, Kelly, and thank you all for joining us this morning for our Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. We're pleased with the continued momentum in our business reflected in our third quarter results, which set new records for revenue, backlog and bookings. Our results underscore our success in growing all segments of our business and demonstrate our ability to deliver our broad capabilities across our diverse customer base. Starting first with the growth engine of the company : Our business development efforts. Results in the quarter were strong even beyond typical seasonal levels. We booked a record amount over $5 billion of net new awards in the quarter, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.8x. These results reflect several notable awards, including a $400 million contract in our defense business for the provision of aircraft intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance support services in support of the Army's Program Executive Office intelligence, electronics warfare and sensors.  We were also awarded a $900 million contract in our Civil business by the Transportation Security Administration to continue to provide Integrated Logistics Support services to sustain TSA passenger-screening equipment at hundreds of airports and other designated facilities across the U.S. and its territories. During the quarter, we run -- we won roughly $1.3 billion of awards from our classified customers, reflecting growth across each of our customers in the Intelligence Community. Our success reflects mission-enabled solutions across transformational software development, analytics and digital transformation. Our success in executing against our pipeline allowed us to increase our backlog to a record level of $23.9 billion, a leading indicator of our future growth potential. Beyond that, we also have a nearly $35 billion of submitted proposals awaiting decision. This still includes several large programs : GSM-O II, Hanford and Navy NextGen, all of which we expect will be awarded in the next couple of quarters. Revenue growth continued to accelerate in the third quarter with year-over-year organic growth of 12%. This growth was broad based across all of our businesses and reflects the success of the scale and diversity of our portfolio. Underpinning our growth was another strong quarter for hiring as we added another 2,500 people, bringing our year-to-date total to over 7,500 new hires.  While the market for talent continues to be tight, our success in hiring in our key growth areas reflect the investments we have made in our organization, our employees and our culture in making Leidos a great place to work. We are proud that every day, nearly 34,000 people choose to work at Leidos, and we take very seriously our responsibility to make their work life more rewarding in order to maximize our ability to retain them and to attract more top-performing talent. Strong margins and a continued resolute focus on cash conversion allowed us to generate nearly $350 million of cash from operations in the quarter, resulting in a quarter-end cash and equivalents balance of $635 million.  During the quarter, we deployed our excess capital consistent with our stated capital deployment philosophy, which balances investments for growth, including organic and M&A, with returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We executed a $200 million accelerated share repurchase during the quarter, which resulted in the retirement of 2.4 million shares outstanding. Beyond this, our M&A pipeline continues to be very robust, and we have been evaluating opportunities across all of our big -- business segments for acquisition targets, both big and small. While we routinely assess the market landscape for potential targets, we run a disciplined process for evaluating opportunities to ensure transactions -- that transactions enable us to improve our strategic position and drive shareholder value. Many of the opportunities we have evaluated did not meet our criteria in these areas. However, we were pleased that 1 target did. We announced and closed the acquisition of IMX Medical Management Services during the quarter, and we are pleased to welcome IMX into the Leidos team. Our combined experience, footprint and commitment to customer service positions us to be a significant player of independent medical evaluations in the commercial market as we are today in the federal space. In the quarter, we also divested our health staff augmentation services business in a sale to Alvarez & Marsal Capital. The business that was divested was a small, immaterial piece of our overall portfolio, which delivered staff augmentation services to commercial health care providers. This divestiture helps Leidos focus on what it does best : Providing solutions that meet the complex needs of our government or other highly regulated and complex industries. We recently completed a major milestone in one of our marquee programs in this area, the DoD Healthcare Management Systems Modernization program, or DHMSM, the largest IT transformation in the history of the military health system. The Leidos partnership for defense health successfully deployed MHS GENESIS to a new wave of military treatment facilities on September 7, 2019. Following the release, our customer, Program Executive Officer of the Defense Healthcare Management Systems, lauded us for what he called a very successful release at Wave Travis.  As I said before, patients' safety is our #1 priority. We added 6 new technical capabilities to MHS GENESIS in advance of this wave, including CV Pax, a system that can be used to treat various heart conditions. Within the first 48 hours of go-live at Travis Air Force Base, a heart attack patient was successfully treated using CB Pax, a capability that did not exist at this hospital before MHS GENESIS.  We also introduced enhanced training curriculum during this wave and noticed a significant increase in the speed of adoption at each site. We continue to make substantial progress on this program, and with this wave behind us, we are looking ahead to the next 2 waves, which have just kicked off predeployment activities right on schedule. These are Wave Nellis, which includes Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, Nevada; and Wave Pendleton, which includes Camp Pendleton in San Diego, California. Wave Nellis is on track to go live in June 2020. Finally, turning now to the macro environment. Conditions continue to remain favorable. The 2-year budget agreement, which provides top line spending amounts for both defense and non-defense spending accounts, creates a supportive foundation for the continued growth of our business. While we are starting the government fiscal year with the continuing resolution as we have for 19 of the last 20 years, we see no material impact from a CR that lasts potentially through the end of the first quarter and could even last through the full government fiscal year 2020. While we are optimistic that we will avert a government shutdown, we are also prepared for this scenario should it occur. As we look ahead, the strength of our results thus far in the year and the continued acceleration in revenue growth gives us confidence to raise our expectations for the year across all guidance metrics.  I'll now hand the call over to Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer, for more details on third quarter results and our revised guidance. James Reagan : Thanks, Roger, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. In the interest of getting to your questions, I'm going to focus my comments on providing some context to the results disclosed in our press release and summarized by Roger.  Revenue grew 10% and 12% organically when you normalize the effects of the commercial cyber and health staff augmentation divestitures. Organic growth was broad based and driven by high levels of on-contract growth and increased contribution from new programs which ramped during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 10.7%, reflecting strong margins in the core business as well as the following. First, the payment of an arbitration award relating to work performed for the Greek Olympics back in 2004. A big thanks to the significant effort by our legal team that resulted in the long-overdue receipt on this work. We collected $59 million in cash from the Greek government and recognized a net $54 million reduction of operating expenses on this item. And this was partially offset by a $19 million provision for certain other international receivables, and this was reflected in the Civil segment results. The net effect of these 2 items was a $35 million benefit.  The second, revenues in the third quarter reflect a higher mix of material volumes, which put downward pressure on margins. And lastly, we incurred significant startup expenses on certain large new program wins, most notably in our Civil business, where we expect margins to revert back to normal levels in the fourth quarter. These items, along with a lower share count, helps to drive non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.36, an increase of $0.22 over the prior year. Operating cash flows of $349 million in the quarter reflects the seasonally strong government fiscal year-end as well as higher advance payments which reduced our accounts receivable and contributed to the reduction in days sales outstanding to 57 days. We expect much of these advances to reverse in the fourth quarter, getting us back to a more typical DSO level in the high 50s to low 60s. Bookings of $5.2 billion were strong across all segments and resulted in a 1.8 consolidated book-to-bill with ending backlog of $23.9 billion. This is once again an all-time high for the company and reflects an 18% increase over the prior year. Now for an overview of our segment results. Defense Solutions grew 8.3% over the prior year quarter, driven by elevated levels of on-contract growth on our mature programs plus new program revenues. Non-GAAP operating margins of 8% declined 60 basis points sequentially and 50 basis points from the prior year primarily on higher materials revenues and lower write-offs. And despite elevated protest activity during the quarter, our Defense Solutions business booked over $2.7 billion of net awards, resulting in a book-to-bill of 2.0x for the quarter and 1.3x on a trailing 12-month basis. In our Civil segment, revenues grew 10.4% sequentially and year-over-year. Organic revenues grew 13.4% when adjusting for the sale of the commercial cyber business which closed in the first quarter. The primary driver of Civil revenue growth both sequentially and compared to the prior year was an increase in new program revenues. Non-GAAP operating margins in our Civil segment of 7.8% were uncharacteristically low, declining 210 basis points sequentially and 540 basis points from the prior year quarter.  Margins reflect two unusual items in the period, which combined, resulted in 220 basis points of negative margin impact. Adjusting for this, the margins in the business were over 10.2%, up slightly from the prior quarter. And these 2 items were : First, the bad debt expense I referred to earlier is reflected within the Civil results and drove a $16 million charge in the quarter; and second, startup expenses associated with a new program ramp -- for a new program that involved a large materials buy component. Because the payment for these costs is made over time, the related profits are recognized over the next 5 years of the program, and this contributed to a margin headwind in the quarter. Civil segment bookings of $1.1 billion were once again strong and drove a book-to-bill of 1.2 for the quarter and 1.0 on a trailing 12-month basis.  In our Health segment, revenue growth, bookings and margins were all the best performers in the company during the quarter. Revenues there grew 14.4% over the prior year period. Growth was driven by a variety of factors : Strong levels of on-contract growth, increased revenue contribution for the ramp in the DHMSM wave deployments and revenues from other new programs. Non-GAAP operating margins of 14.8% were 40 basis points higher sequentially and 60 basis points higher than the previous year, driven by strong execution across a variety of mature programs in the portfolio. Health bookings were very strong in the quarter at $1.4 billion, largely driven by a mix of on-contract growth and recompete decisions. This resulted in a book-to-bill of 2.7x for the quarter and 2.1x on a trailing 12-month basis. With the strength of our Q3 results and the continued large pipeline of submits outstanding, we remain confident that we will continue along the growth path we've been on now for over a year. And as such, we are revising our 2019 guidance upwards as follows. We expect revenue for the year between $10.9 billion and $11 billion, a $150 million increase from the midpoint of the previous guidance and about a 7.4% increase at the midpoint over the prior year. Further, our results thus far in the year and our visibility into fiscal 2020 has further increased our confidence in our continued growth momentum into 2020. As always, we will provide more information on our fiscal 2020 guidance in our fourth quarter earnings conference call. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins for the year between 10.2% and 10.4%, a 30 basis point increase at the midpoint from the previous guidance. We now expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $4.90 to $5.10, an increase of $0.38 from the midpoint of the prior guide. This reflects the higher expected net income and lower share count resulting from the ASR completed in Q3.  Finally, we expect cash flow from operations to be at least $875 million, up from the prior floor of $825 million, reflecting the Greek arbitration award. One additional note related to free cash flow. We now expect capital expenditures for the year of approximately $125 million, which is $50 million lower than our prior guidance of $175 million, which is primarily driven by lower expected real estate spending.  Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob so we can take some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Edward Caso : Great. Congrats here. I was curious about your cloud positioning, particularly in the wake of the JEDI decision. How does Leidos play in the whole, what we're hearing as an accelerating transition by the Defense Department to the cloud? Roger Krone : Thanks, Ed, and good morning. We tend to utilize the cloud as purchased by our customer. So think of our business as cloud transformation or moving applications from legacy to the cloud. And in some contracts, we will contract with AWS, Azure or whomever for cloud services as a pass-through, but typically, the actual provisioning of the provider of the cloud is not in our contract. So we tend to do the value-added of converting legacy to cloud. And that's true really across the board, whether it be in a DoD or in our Civil or Health business. So we call this sort of digital transformation, and it's one of the largest areas of -- in our pipeline. And the decision by the Department of Defense to go with Microsoft Azure versus AWS is really immaterial to us. We won't be affected by that decision in any way. Edward Caso : I have a question that's around -- you talked a little bit about the CR, but it looks like we're heading to at least a second one. At what point does the extension of CR start to impact the forward outlook? Roger Krone : Yes. Yes. For us, really very little, if at all. We've looked at -- we first looked through end of November and then we thought maybe end of the year. And then we've done analysis through the first quarter. Now we've run it for the full fiscal year. And we don't have a lot of 2020 new starts in our pipeline, so I would say it's minimal. You never want to say it's 0, but it's really immaterial for us relative to what's in our pipeline. I think it's complicated and it's complex for our customers who are trying to put together budgets and think long term. But because of the increase that we've had with the two year budget, where we come off the prior year budget process for the purpose of the CR, we're actually in pretty good shape. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Robert Spingarn : So I wanted to ask a couple of things, if I might. Roger, I wanted to start with your commercial strategy as it stands today. Is this a business you're seeking to expand in light of the IMX acquisition? Or is that more specifically targeted for those assets? Roger Krone : Sure. Thanks, Rob. We've been successful in doing disability assessments for the VA. And as such, we have built what we think is a national capability to do medical exams and disability assessments. We believe there's a parallel for corporations, health care centers, private employers. And that industry is starting to consolidate and we just see it as an opportunity to take, if you will, sort of our back end and the process work we've done for the government and to apply that in the commercial marketplace. And the easiest way for us to get a foothold was through an acquisition, and we were pleased to be able to come to terms with the team at IMX. Robert Spingarn : Okay. And then at a higher level, I wanted to address the relationship between sales growth and record backlogs but also this idea that the duration of backlogs appears to be expanding across the industry. So meaning that if duration is extended, you might expect growth to slow a little bit. So I wanted to ask you how will you think about those two factors. Or is this double-digit-type growth just supportable for a while? Roger Krone : Let's see. A couple of quick comments. As we look at the duration in our backlog, it's approximately the same. So for us, I can't speak for the rest of the industry, we don't really see it stretching or contracting. And so therefore if you follow the logic as sort of you laid out, if we have high -- a large number of wins, we increase our backlog, we see organic growth, then that's sustainable through the duration of what's in our backlog. And we talked about this in prior calls. It just takes so long, right, in our business for backlog programs to start, for that to flow through the PPBS system and actually turn into revenue for us. This is like a 2- or 3-year forward-looking momentum. And although we can't predict the outcome of the election or what will happen to budgets post that, we feel very, very confident now for multiple years looking forward. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Cai von Rumohr : So a number of your competitors have kind of noted that bookings have been slowed by lots of protests, decisions happening late. And certainly in your case, GSM-O, Hanford and NextGen have moved to the right. Two questions. One, what do you think is causing this phenomenon and maybe with some specifics on your 3 outstanding bids? And maybe update us on kind of the status of protests either of things you've won or things you've lost. Roger Krone : Let's see. Thanks, Cai. I would tell you that it's almost like a seasonal delay. It's just momentum, people, staffing, programs getting through peer reviews in the building and then getting to award. And I actually don't think these delays are atypical. I mean sometimes a program -- we've actually had some that came out early. But typically, we always add 90 days or so to award dates that are promulgated by customers because it just -- they take so much time to get it right. And because of the expected protests, they want to sort of white-glove the decision so that they can sustain a protest. In the protest front, without going through everything that's in protest, maybe a quarter or two ago, we were down to almost nothing, either offense or defense. And now with a summer of awards, some that were awarded to us, some that we lost, we've seen the protest volume increase. And I think that's very typical with sort of the awards seasonality that we have in the government cycle, that a lot of things are awarded just at the end of the government fiscal year, and then therefore a lot of protests happen at that time, and that's what we've seen. On our major programs, we expect Hanford and GSM-O in the fourth quarter, probably maybe NextGen first quarter or shortly thereafter. But I'm sure you would remind me, at one time, I thought Hanford would be awarded in July. And so we all -- we stay close to the customer, we keep our bids fresh, and we hope that they get through their award process and these things get awarded before the end of the year. Cai von Rumohr : And just the last one. Jim, you mentioned the adjustments in Civil. In defense, your margins looked a little lower. You mentioned the materials being up. And maybe give us some -- how much -- yes, and the EACs being down. Can you give us a little more granularity on some of those issues? James Reagan : Yes. We have won an Army contract, Cai, where we had a -- they have some -- I wouldn't even call it seasonal, some not entirely predictable lumpiness in some support-related materials purchases that we make that carried lower margins. And that within the quarter was a margin headwind. And then I think as I mentioned, there were a higher level of EAC write-ups in the period a year ago. So those are the 2 primary contributors to the defense margin change year-over-year. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Seth Seifman : I wonder, is there any more additional detail you can give about the charge in Civil? Sort of what contract that is and what gives you confidence that any issues are behind you, the $16 million bad debt. James Reagan : Yes. Seth, I don't want to get into the details around the specific contract. I can tell you though that the decision to take a provision on these receivables, which relate to overseas contracts that we had in the Civil group, were based primarily on conditions we saw on the ground and where the status was on our efforts to get some outstanding receivables collected.  Of course, as we mentioned earlier about the recovery of this arbitration award on Greece that was long outstanding, similarly, the receivables that we've taken a provision for in a different geography in the world, we're not going to stop our collection efforts there simply because we've taken a charge on it. And you can easily -- I can see a scenario where sometime in the future, several quarters or maybe even a couple of years, we'd see recovery on that. But for right now, we thought the prudent thing to do was to take a reserve for it. Roger Krone : And Seth, that was a $19 million charge. When you boil it all down between the recovery on the Greek arbitration award and the provision we took on those other overseas receivables, it's a net of about $35 million. Seth Seifman : Right. And then just a follow-up. Looking through the year thus far, it looks like to reach the EBITDA margin guidance, we're looking at something in the 10.3-ish range for the fourth quarter. The last two years, we've seen the margin tick down in the fourth quarter. What kind of gives you the confidence in that fourth quarter margin? James Reagan : Yes. I understand your question, Seth. Actually, I think that the implied margins in Q4 are a little bit higher than that. But it really has to do with -- we've got good visibility on what the revenue mix is for Q4. And as I mentioned during the prepared remarks, we're expecting the Civil margins to recover back to what we normally see. We'll see that in the fourth quarter. Actually, could be even stronger there. And again, Q4 looks like a strong revenue mix of fixed price and unit price-related work that will generate some stronger-than-normal Q4 margins. Operator : The next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Just expanding maybe on the last question with regards to all 3 segments. You've had a bunch of new wins and strong revenue growth. How do you think about the margin mix, where it's been impacted most and how you think about that bridging into 2020? James Reagan : Sheila, I appreciate the question, and we think about this all the time. The -- as we've said before, ramp-up of new programs, and we're certainly seeing a little bit of this -- well, certainly some of it in Q3. In the early phases of a program ramp, the margins tend to be lower than they are for the normal life of the program. We had some new program ramps in the Civil group that we had to take some upfront provision on, and you see that in the Q3 results. We don't expect that to recur.  And as revenue growth is higher than what we might have guided to previously, one might think that, that would put some additional pressure on margins going forward. In fact, we haven't seen as much of that pressure as we had previously discussed. And that I think speaks well to strong program execution, and you see that across the program ramps that we have in Civil, where as I mentioned, that dip we had in margin in the first quarter gets recovered in future periods. And that's an artifact of the accounting for some leased equipment on a couple of programs.  Particularly in the -- if you're thinking about the Health margins, we are now -- and we continue to believe that the Health margins, which were very strong in the quarter, continue to be sustainable. And we're very pleased with execution on some of our newer and even more mature programs within the Health group. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Great. And then maybe just a question on Health to expand on that. Roger, thanks for the color on IMX earlier. How do you think about that portfolio? The margins have been quite strong, you're adding IMX, divesting the health augmentation business. Kind of how do you think about expanding that or what that business looks like over the next few years? Roger Krone : Well of course, Sheila, as you implied, we're investing in the part of the business that's doing well. So that should give us confidence in our margin. We were able to sell part of the business that really wasn't in our portfolio. Clearly, that would have been lower-margin for us. I think it will do better in the hands of someone who's more focused on that business.  We continue to be very confident about the performance in the Health group. But we're -- obviously, we don't guide by our segment. We're not going to do it here. But you would expect us to double down on parts of the Health business that are doing well and to exit those that don't fit our strategy and our portfolio going forward, and that's exactly what we did. Operator : The next question is from the line of Matt Akers with Barclays. Matthew Akers : I wanted to ask if you could elaborate I guess a little bit on the M&A market, what you're seeing there. You mentioned a little bit in kind of the opening remarks, but sort of what have been the deals that you looked at so far? Where have they fallen short? Is it just the valuation or just kind of lack of something that's a good fit with Leidos? Roger Krone : Matt, it runs the gamut. Some, we just can't -- we're net present value kind of people as opposed to multiple people. So we're looking -- we look at M&A, we're looking -- we do like a 5-year off and a 10-year set of forecasts. So -- and then we discount that back. So that drives value. I think other people are buying off of multiple, and that's not where we are. We're really looking for the long-term value in a company. So there's some deals that have been priced away from us.  I'm sure you're familiar with the process. You often get an offering memorandum or a management presentation. And of course, when that happens, everything looks great. And then you get in and do due diligence, and what was thought to be a high value-added company looks more like a training company or something. And so we want to look at a lot because I think there is continued defense and civil consolidation and we want to be part of that. But we want to make sure that it tracks well with our strategies. And so we will -- again, we'll be involved in the front end of a lot of transactions. We don't expect to be there at the end on very many. Matthew Akers : Got it. And then I guess, I think you mentioned 2,500 headcount adds in the quarter. Was that the gross number? And if so, could you give us what the attrition was? Roger Krone : Yes. That's the gross number and we don't really recount the net number. But obviously, the net number is going to be less than that. And I think we actually put the headcount in our release so you can track our headcount quarter-to-quarter. But we are -- continue to be confident in our ability to attract people, also people with the appropriate security clearances and the right experience and educational background. And we have a great team that does talent acquisition for us. But I think there's also something about some changes that we've made and the image that Leidos has out there in the workforce and how we treat our employees and how we've made this a great place to come to work. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Jonathan Raviv : Just back to the margin question for a moment, guys. Implied 4Q in the mid-10s, I think you called the Health result somewhat sustainable as you double down on the higher-margin stuff. And now two years in a row, nicely booked 10% adjusted EBITDA. So is 10% still the normative -- the right normative rate to think about going forward here? James Reagan : Yes. Jon, this is Jim. What we said in the past is that we're looking for longer-term adjusted EBITDA margins 10% or north of 10%. And you're right in how you're thinking about Q4. It is continued sustainment of strong margins in Health but also what we think is -- what we know is going to be nice recovery is the margin profile of the Civil group which, for some time, has been set up for a nice Q4 margin with -- based on orders that are currently in the pipeline for certain things. And so that speaks to the confidence that we have both in Q4 and the full year margins. Jonathan Raviv : Okay. And then bigger-picture question on the M&A strategy. I mean, Roger, you mentioned you're interested in things both small and big. What does big mean to you? And with the company in a place where growth is strong, the BD machine is running nicely, what is missing? How do you weigh kind of getting -- adding an all-new big thing to a machine that seem to be running quite nicely? Roger Krone : Yes. Okay. So small tends to be the $50 million to $100 million in revenue. By the way, big tends to be over $1 billion in revenue. So -- and I will share we're not looking at an ISGS-size big. I mean I've just -- we just don't see anything on the landscape that would be like the deal that we did in '16. And our strategy on M&A really is to look at 2 things, is capability and customer. So is there an aspect of our business that we think we need that we don't have to complete a portfolio for a customer? Or is there some customer access, past performance calls, scale that we don't have to be able to appropriately address a segment of the marketplace that we're not in today? And I know it may seem like we're everywhere, we're actually not. There's a significant amount of our customer base that we would call not addressable at this time. And so we look at those areas. And again, we've got a criteria that we use we talked about at our Investment Day back in May, and those are the criteria that we use to filter our M&As. James Reagan : And Jon, when we think about investments in M&A, in many ways, you can think about our investments in internal and organic growth the same way. And we've been be making some significant investments over the last couple of years that you're seeing reflected in our top line organic growth for Q3 and for the full year. And as long as we're getting nice dividends on those investments, you're going to continue to see us focus on that as much as we are looking for the right accretive -- both strategic and financially, the right, accretive kinds of acquisitions. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer with SunTrust. Tobey Sommer : I was wondering if we could start -- Roger, can you talk about constraints to growth? What are the sort of limits to the company's ability to grow organically? Roger Krone : Well, okay. So we haven't found those yet. And you can kind of break it into a couple of categories. Access to capital markets probably has never been as good for us as it is today, the cost of borrowing is low. Because we're a people business, all of our strategies revolve around our people and our talent, and I would put that in 2 categories : Our business development team and our ability to develop those relationships with customers and to pursue procurements, which is a multi-year campaign for us. And so you have to have the customer relations people, the business development people, the proposal people. And those are probably the most rare commodity in our market today.  And then on the backside, you don't want to bid on a program if you cannot staff post award. And so we're really, really thoughtful about what we bid on and our ability to attract people. As we all know, very, very difficult to hire in the national capital region. And so as we look at things going forward, we're excited about opportunities where we can staff the program in places other than the Virginia, Washington, Maryland, Delaware. So if there was a program in Colorado Springs or Denver or St. Louis, then that would be a great place for us to look simply because of all the economic growth that has already occurred here in the D.C. area. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gavin Parsons with Goldman Sachs. Gavin Parsons : On the revenue guidance, it's the second raise this year. So just curious if you could talk a little bit more about what's surprising you kind of relative to your initial plan? If it's better new business wins, higher recompete win rate, more on-contract growth, faster movement by the customer, just any color there would be great. James Reagan : Well again, I think you just hit on all of them. Just to put a little bit more color around it. Roger had just alluded to being able to attract the talent that we need to be able to convert backlog into revenue. We're pleased with how we're doing in terms of the process and capabilities we have in our HR and recruiting department. They're doing a fantastic job of helping us meet the customer needs.  The second one is there's been -- when we look at the additions to backlog and the components of book-to-bill this quarter, about 1/3 of the additions to backlog are new work and takeaway. And then about 1/3 of it is growing existing programs, either through addition of option years or on-contract growth, much of which is actually sold by the people that are working every day with the customers. And we've had a lot of focus across the business in on-contract growth. And then another 1/3 of that comes from successful acquisition of recompete business. So it feels -- and if it sounds like it's a kind of a balanced way to look at it, it certainly is.  And so I think that the way that we're getting to a better than previously expected revenue is just strong execution, both on the program side and great people and process and the return on the investments we've made in our business development teams. Gavin Parsons : Got it. And then you mentioned no extension in the kind of backlog duration. The total book-to-bill has been great, but funded looks maybe a little bit soft on a trailing 12-month basis. Does that have any implications for kind of next 12-month growth relative to kind of the longer period that's supported by total backlog? Or is that just lumpiness here? James Reagan : Yes. That really is -- it speaks to some lumpiness in how the backlog gets funded. We're not worried about the downtick in the funded piece of the backlog, Gavin. I think that the other point relative to the duration of backlog, which is not materially changed, it is the -- it speaks to the comment that I made during the prepared remarks that it gives us more confidence coming out of 2020 in the growth rate that we've been putting out there for post '19. And we'll have more comment on what our expected growth is looking like beyond 2019 when we put our guidance out there, and we'll do that in the Q4 call. Gavin Parsons : Okay. And if I could sneak a quick last one in. Just as you mentioned, the -- doing a great job hiring. Are you able to get people on contract more quickly or get them cleared faster? Or is there any sort of kind of operating leverage that still needs to flow through the margin as you get those people on contract? Roger Krone : Yes. Gavin, it's a little bit better. I'm -- I don't think anyone in the industry is just out celebrating yet. I mean there's hope, maybe 6 months or a year, that process will continue to be streamlined. One of sort of our business models is you may have a mental image that we have 2,500 college hires. And our approach really, we have maybe only 10% of that number is college hires. We tend to try to recruit more midcareer people, and that means they often already have a clearance. Or maybe they have what we call a secret, and then it's a little easier for us to get them the hire, security clearance, if they come in to us with a secret.  So our time typically from hire to getting them cleared and getting them onto a contract and generating revenue tends to be shorter than the mental picture you may have of you get somebody out of a college and university and they start their paperwork, and it's often an 8-month, 12-month journey. So it's part of our strategy on attracting a workforce where they've already been through the adjudication process. But the clearance process in and of itself has gotten better, but it is -- and the backlog is significantly reduced, both by the way, on the contractor side and on the government side. But the work flow through the process is still way too long and probably a minimum of 6 months. And some people, depending upon if you've lived overseas, could be as long as 18 months. Operator : The next question is a follow-up from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Seth Seifman : Roger, I was just wondering, we hear a fair amount from DoD these days about Fourth Estate reform. And I was wondering if that's something that you're kind of focused on at all and whether you think there's any potential impact on Leidos and on the services space. Roger Krone : Yes. Obviously a lot going on in that area. We know that the new Secretary of Defense and the Head of Acquisition are doing reviews on the Fourth Estate. Maybe for everybody else on the call, the Fourth Estate tends to refer to noncombat agencies in the Department of Defense, organizations like DISA, DLA, maybe some of the 3-digit intel organizations, that are viewed not as a direct combat organization. And there -- when Secretary Shanahan was there, and Secretary Esper, view this as an opportunity to apply technology to create more efficiencies, and therefore to maybe harvest some budget there to be able to spend directly on combat organizations.  We have a great balance between the services and these support organizations. We work closely with them. Our business tends to be around driving efficiencies into these organizations. I mean it's really what we do. In some of the contracts we've had, we've taken out numbers like 20% of top line costs. So we actually view the activity that's going on right now as an opportunity for us, both in the contracts that we already have with these agencies and opportunity for new contracts in organizations like DLA.  As you all know, we were fortunate enough to win a program in the United Kingdom called LCST where we have done essentially digital transformation of commodity purchase and distribution in the United Kingdom. And our -- we get rewarded there based upon driving efficiency into their procurement system. We have learned a lot about how to run a procurement organization and how to modernize processes. We think those lessons learned are directly applicable to some of what the Secretary would like to do in the Defense Logistics Agency here in the U.S., and we look forward to the opportunity to respond to RFIs and RFPs and help our customer think about how they can transform, if you will, some of these Fourth Estate organizations. Operator : The next question is from the line of Joe DeNardi with Stifel. Jonathan Ladewig : This is Jon on for Joe. Can you kind of update us on what's driving the success in your new wins and takeaways and how this kind of plays into your recompete win? Roger Krone : Well, boy, gosh, if I knew exactly what was working, I probably wouldn't -- I might have even a higher rate. Let's see. You all have been on this call for quarters. And you know a couple of years ago, we felt we were not winning as much as we had hoped or we expected. And we really went back through and thought through our whole relationship with customers; how do we qualify our pipeline; our bid, no-bids or pursues; and the whole business development process around how do we create an offering and how do we do pricing and then how do we write proposals? And it really was a sort of a top-to-bottom overhaul of the processes that we inherited both from Leidos and from IS&GS and really, what we think, was took the best of all the processes out there and rebuilt our business development processes and in to some way our organization.  And what you're seeing now is what I call the time constant of when do you address the issue, and then how long does it take to flow through sort of the PPBS proposal process? If I implement a new proposal process, you don't see it in a win until 18 months later because that's how long it takes to go pursue an opportunity, work with a customer on their program work statement, on the procurement, actually get an RFP, write a proposal and go through the evaluation cycle. And the good story that we have today is really based upon a lot of hard work that was done 18 months or 24 months ago. And that was of course in response to a couple of losses we had 2 or 3 years ago. So Jon, I hope that answers your question. Operator : We have a follow-up question coming from the line of Robert Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Robert Spingarn : Just wanted to ask you one more thing. Kind of specific, but I thought it was interesting what you're doing with the Army and the ISR world. And this business that you have, which I guess is a company-owned, company-operated or COCO structure, sort of a big safari where you own the assets. I wanted to ask you if -- how you're thinking about this kind of opportunity, the risk there? And what other opportunities? Is this a business you want to grow, this sort of COCO approach? Roger Krone : Let's see, Rob. As you know, we have been in the mission support business forever. And then going back to -- back when we had a significant amount of OCO work, we all work all -- 5, 6 years ago, you all used to ask how much OCO work we had. And that was specifically related to aircraft in theater that were doing collection missions. What we have said is we want to be in a mission support role with a host of customers and that we were comfortable with multiple business models, from GOCO, OCO in our ARL-E program, we simply will be providing an airplane to the Army for the Army reconnaissance low enhanced program, we -- actually modern airplane, and we DD 250 that airplane and provide it to the customer.  We have seen some opportunities as of late to invest in aircraft, in capital, and then to provide those as more of a COCO model. And those have allowed us to be a little bit more responsive, to get capability to the field faster because it's entirely within our control. But it is not going to be overweighted. It is part of our portfolio and our mission support business. And we're, again, pleased with the opportunity we've had to provide that capability.  At the same time, if you were to go to our hangars and look at our stable of programs, you would find other aircraft in the other models. And then of course, we have our Afghan support program where, through an Army contract, we actually support the Afghan Air Force the Mi-17s in theater. And that's on a direct support program. So again, we have broad portfolio of contracts in our Army and multiservice ISR business. Robert Spingarn : Would you say you've turned down opportunities for COCO work where the risk profile was just too high? James Reagan : Well Rob, I think that we've been able to shape the service profile collectively with our customer so that it's acceptable with the right kind of return. And what we're able to do for our customer is to -- at a predictable cost, they pay us for availability, and that delivers what the customer wants and it gives us the right kind of return on our COCO investment. Roger Krone : Yes. But Rob, that means that we do have some preliminary conversations with customers. And there clearly are edge opportunities that we are not -- we don't do and we're not going to do. And you know us. We're always thinking of being very capital-light. We are not an ILFC, we're not an aircraft lessor. We don't want to be in that business. We tend to invest or go over the COCO model where it's a customer we have a long history, where it's a mission that's understandable, that we think we can execute and we can make a return on our capital investment. So I don't want you to walk away from this conversation thinking that our CapEx is going to go up and we're going to be a heavy investor in aircraft or surface ships or whatever. That's really not where we're going. This is a nice add to a business that we already had and it allowed us to access a customer that we might not have otherwise been able to access. But our typical model is sort of a standard government contract where the asset is really owned by the customer. Operator : Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session for today, and I'll turn the call back to Kelly Hernandez for closing remarks. Kelly Hernandez : Great. Thank you, Rob, and thank you all for your time this morning and for your interest in Leidos. We look forward to updating you again next quarter. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Leidos Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Results. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I will turn the call over to Kelly Hernandez with Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Hernandez. Kelly Hernandez : Thank you, Rob and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of the Leidos management team. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter ending January 3rd, 2020. Roger will lead off the call with notable highlights from the quarter as well as comments on the market environment and our Company's strategy. Jim will follow with a discussion of our financial performance and our guidance expectations. After these remarks from Roger and Jim, we'll open the call for your questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, during the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in the press release that we issued this morning and is also available in the presentation slides. The press release and presentation as well as supplementary financial information are provided on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.leidos.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone. Roger Krone : Thank you, Kelly and thank you all for joining us this morning for our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call. We delivered strong fourth quarter results, including record organic revenue growth, increasing margins and significant year-over-year non-GAAP earnings growth. Our growth and execution momentum accelerated throughout 2019 and has continued into 2020 with significant new program wins and the opportunity to create value from our two recently announced acquisitions. I am confident that we are growing the Company with the right talent, the right capabilities and the right strategy to continue to drive value for our customers, employees and shareholders. Revenues for the quarter were $2.95 billion, up 11.6% from the prior year and 14% organically, reflecting broad-based strength with all of our segments growing double digits. Our top line growth was accompanied by an increase in our adjusted EBITDA margins, which grew to 11% in the quarter, up 130 basis points compared to the prior year period. Together these drove our non-GAAP EPS to $1.51 for the quarter. For the full year, we generated revenues of $11.1 billion, up 11% organically and we expanded margins to 10.5%, while growing non-GAAP earnings per share 18% to $5.17. Growing revenues while also increasing margins and thoughtfully deploying our cash enable Leidos to achieve total shareholder return of 89% in 2019, which was the highest among our peers. Jim will go through more detail on the results in a moment, but I would like to take this time to acknowledge our talented employees who enable these significant financial successes through their operational execution. Their commitment to our customers and to our strategy was instrumental in our success and is what makes Leidos, the great company we are today, a great place to work, and I want to thank all of them for their hard work during the year. With regard to organic growth in operations. We have achieved significant success over the last few months. We won our two largest recompetes GSM-O II and Hanford as well as our largest takeaway program to date in the award of the Navy NextGen program, which carries a ceiling value of $7.7 billion. These wins truly demonstrate the power of the scale of the organization we have built as well as the breadth of our innovative capabilities. GSM-O II and NextGen are both incredibly complex digital transformation programs for two of our nation's most important networks, the DoD and the Navy respectively. We are proud to have been entrusted with this responsibility and are confident we will provide the DoD, our sailors and marines around the world with the tools they need to gain a war fighting edge in the modern digital landscape. Combined, these programs alone Hanford, GSM-O II and NextGen have provided us with more than $18 billion in single award IDIQ ceiling value, an 8 to 10 years of visibility, further strengthening our business. With two of these - while two of these programs have been protested, we expect those protests to be resolved in the second quarter. We have a good track record on winning defensive protests and if we are able to extend that track record and successfully defend these wins, work would begin by the start of the third quarter. Due to the protests and the IDIQ structure, these wins have not benefited our bookings at all yet. That said, beyond these notable wins, our business development engine continues to extend its period of strong performance with $3 billion of net bookings in the fourth quarter, bringing the total full year net bookings to $14.5 billion. We exited the year with more than $24 billion of total backlog, a record level and more than twice our annualized revenue run rate. Beyond our organic operational execution, we have also been successful on the M&A front. In the recent months, we entered into agreements for two acquisitions that will help us to accelerate the execution of our strategy. First was Dynetics, which we announced in December and closed at the end of January. And the second was L3Harris' security detection and automation business, which we announced in early February. This builds on our acquisition of IMX in 2019, which is now part of our healthcare business. We have disciplined acquisition criteria that we've talked about before and we're pleased to acquire these strategically important properties that fit well within the Company and were acquired at prices that made sense. These acquisitions helped to broaden our portfolio of products and services in high-growth, high-margin areas further expanding the scale of the business. We believe these transactions will position the Company on a higher growth curve and yield significant positive value for our customers and shareholders over the long term. I am proud of all of those at the Company who collectively helped to drive successful agreements for all of these acquisitions. This momentum in both organic and inorganic growth is due to calculated strategic initiatives we have undertaken throughout the organization. Throughout 2019, we elevated our business development organization and processes to successfully leverage the scale of the organization and the innovation embodied in our technical capabilities, allowing us to repeatedly and efficiently write successful proposals and win new contracts. We deepened our collaboration and partnership with our customers by engaging them early and providing them with innovative solutions to solve their mission challenges. We invested in our people through improved benefits, more training and development opportunities, and increased flexibility, which enabled us to beat our hiring targets and cultivate a deep bench of highly talented leaders to advance our organization. As a Company, we have rallied around driving growth without sacrificing margin, converting profits to cash and then thoughtfully deploying that capital in a balanced manner to drive shareholder value. To that end, we deployed nearly $1 billion of capital in 2019, roughly 70% of which was returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, with about 10% used for M&A and the remainder for CapEx and mandatory debt payments. This balanced approach is consistent with the capital allocation plan, we laid out at our May Investor Day. Also in accordance with what we have said in the past, with our net leverage ratio estimated to be at about 3.7 times post-closing of the security detection and automation transaction, we will pivot our capital deployment initiatives to focus on debt reduction, until this net leverage ratio again approaches our target level of 3.0. We anticipate reaching that level in the first quarter of 2021. As we look to 2020, we are focused on successfully executing all of the opportunities we have captured in 2019. From an organic perspective, we have significant wins in each of our businesses that we are committed to executing well. While some are recompetes, all of them will require us to continue to bring innovation to our customers and a fresh perspective focused on effectively and securely delivering their missions. On the takeaway work, we are focused on starting off on a great foundation, ramping our recruiting efforts to ensure we have the talent to commit to the contracts and successfully executing those programs to deliver on all of our commitments. With respect to our inorganic initiatives, there are two sets of activities underway. First on the Dynetics acquisition, we are pleased to welcome the 2,300 employees from Dynetics to the Leidos family. Dave King, the CEO of Dynetics will continue to lead the business, which is now the fifth business group within the Company. The Dynetics business will be consolidated into our Defense Solutions segment for external reporting purposes. Dave will serve as Group President and he has been appointed as the newest member of the executive leadership team. Additionally, we have appointed a leader for the Integration Management Office or IMO for this transaction, who will be supported by representatives from each of the functional areas. This cross-functional team will ensure that Leidos business processes are followed and the Dynetics business systems are properly connected with the Leidos corporate systems, leveraging the strengths of both businesses in these efforts. Our integration activities will largely focus on knowledge sharing between Dynetics and Leidos in order to support new opportunity development. Second, regarding the recently announced pending acquisition of L3Harris security detection and automation businesses. Once the acquisition has closed, these businesses will be combined with our existing security products business, which resides within our Civil group. We anticipate the integration activities for this transaction will be more extensive than those of either Dynetics or IMX. However, they will be significantly less than our prior IS&GS transaction, where we demonstrated our ability to integrate successfully. We have already identified a preliminary set of activities and key leaders that would drive the cost and revenue efficiencies we previously discussed, as being a key aspect of the transaction. We have a great playbook from the IS&GS transaction, the Leidos business framework that will drive the actions and activities needed to fully integrate the business. From a macro perspective, we see 2020 as an extension of the strength we saw in 2019. Outlays are projected to continue to rise at least through fiscal year 2022, given the large prior year unobligated balances. DoD's investment accounts procurement and R&D continue at historically high levels. The top technology priorities are consistent with last year's with strong emphasis on space, hypersonics, cyber and electronic warfare and are directly aligned with our growth initiatives and technical capabilities. The present's fiscal year '21 budget request was released last week. The request sets discretionary spending levels at $741 billion including overseas contingent operations for defense roughly flat with the prior year. Our initial review of the available material shows budget increases directly aligned to our areas of strength, cyber, artificial intelligence, hypersonics and space. The budget request of $590 billion for non-defense represents about a 10% decline from the prior year, while the agencies we have exposure to are far less impacted by the proposed cuts. The Democratic led house is unlikely to accept significant decline in the non-defense agencies. We expect negotiations on an agency level - on agency level appropriations to take place over the next few months and likely conclude by this summer. Overall, we are encouraged by the visibility and priorities to find by the budgets and expect to benefit from that at least through the next couple of years. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer, for more details on our results and our 2020 outlook. James Reagan : Thank you, Roger and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. Leidos achieved record results in 2019 and this strong momentum has continued so far into the first couple of months of 2020. Starting first with revenue. We achieved 14% organic growth in the fourth quarter, which was driven broadly by the ramp up of new program wins in all of our businesses. In addition to this, during the quarter, we benefited from the impact of a couple of extra working days, driven by the effect of the 53 week year. The 11% adjusted EBITDA margins in the quarter, a record for the Company reflect a few key items I want to note. First, the primary driver is our strong program execution. This is one of those items that doesn't typically get a lot of attention, but across the Company, our employees' commitment to our customers and to the missions we help them perform is at the heart of our strong program performance. Consistency in delivering on our commitments and in many cases going above and beyond to ensure our customers are successful is recognized and rewarded by our customers both through award fees, but also through new program awards that we believe will help continue this momentum. Second, as we've alluded to on prior calls, as new program wins mature, margin increases. Throughout the year, many of the new programs that had impacted margins earlier in the year continue to mature, enabling us to improve margins in the fourth quarter to the highest margin level during the year, and as I said in the Company's history. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.51 in the quarter, drove the full-year non-GAAP earnings to $5.17, exceeding the top end of our guidance range. Fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS grew 37% from the prior period, reflecting the revenue growth and increased margins as well as a reduction in share count of 6 million shares, resulting from our share repurchase activity during the year including $25 million in the fourth quarter. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $169 million, driving our full year number to $992 million, again considerably above our guidance. After adjusting for CapEx of $121 million in the year, we converted 116% of our non-GAAP net income to free cash flow. As we've said in the past, our target here is 100%, and occasionally we will over or underperform relative to that primarily driven by the timing of advanced payments. In 2019, as we've mentioned on prior calls, we benefited from approximately $100 million of advanced payments from customers. We expect these to reverse in 2020 and we will talk more about them when we get to guidance. Business development results for the quarter and the year were also very strong. At the consolidated level, we exit exited the year with a record backlog level of $24.1 billion and a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.3. All of our segments generated book-to-bills for the year, north of 1.0 with health being the strongest at 1.6x. As Roger indicated, these results do not reflect the recent wins that are under protest. Now, let me share some comments on our segment results. Revenues in the Defense Solutions segment accelerated throughout the year exiting at a 10.7% growth rate in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. This growth and acceleration primarily reflects the ramp of new takeaway programs such as ACC ISR and a great job of driving on contract growth on GSM-O and several other classified programs. The business also benefited a bit from seasonally higher materials purchases in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP operating margins in our Defense Solutions segment increased to 9.9%, up 220 basis points from the prior year quarter and 190 basis points sequentially. The increase was driven by program write-ups that reflect strong program performance as I indicated earlier. The margins also reflect an approximate 70 basis point benefit from a reserve release that was associated with the successful settlement of an outstanding legal matter. As we look to 2020 similar to what we saw in our Civil segment in late '18 and early '19, the large volume of expected new program ramps including GSM-O II and Navy NextGen is likely to dampen margins in this segment temporarily. In our Civil segment, revenues in the fourth quarter grew 16.2% over the prior year. This reflects the continued ramp of program wins from late 2018 and beyond including NASA NEST, DOE, NETL and the FAA Future Flight Service Program for FFSP and a high-level of security product shipments. We also benefited from higher volumes in our Hanford and Arctic support programs reflecting typical seasonality. Volumes in these programs are more weighted in the second half of the year and we expect the same pattern in 2020. Civil segment non-GAAP operating margins of 11.4% in the quarter reflect a significant nearly 400 basis point improvement sequentially and 160 basis point improvement over the prior year. As you may recall from the third quarter, margins reflected a write-down on some receivables on an overseas program and that we anticipated a recovery to more normal programs that we now see in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is also when the majority of our gain share is recognized on our LCST program in the UK and this drove an incremental benefit in the quarter as well. Turning now to our Health segment. Fourth quarter results were strong here across all metrics. Revenue grew nearly 14% organically adjusting for the divestiture of the commercial health business, which closed in the third quarter, revenue growth was driven by higher volumes in our disability exam business, the ramp up of a recent award with CMS for end user centric IT support or ECIS as well as the continued ramp of dim sum deployment activity. Non-GAAP operating margins remained well north of our target at 16%, driven by strong operational performance across the segment including increased contributions from one of our more nascent businesses, digital health solutions, but we're having increased success selling the broader Company suite of digital transformation capabilities into the commercial health market. We continue to expect normalized margins in this business in the mid - at the low to mid-teens, and as we've said, there will be some quarters that deviate from that driven by program mix and volume. Overall, 2019 was a great year, not just for the operational and financial successes that our team has delivered, but for the $14.5 billion of net new bookings and more than $18 billion of new single award IDIQ ceiling awarded to the Company. These successes as well as the M&A transactions that we've highlighted will position us for continued growth and success in 2020 and beyond. Now, onto our guidance for 2020. We recognize that there are lot of moving parts between the acquisitions and the recent large program wins, so, we will try to be a little bit more descriptive in our commentary. First, we expect revenue in the range of $12.6 billion to $13.0 billion, reflecting growth of 13% to 17% from the prior year. We've included approximately $900 million of Dynetics' revenue, and in this guidance range for the prior year, in line with our prior expectation, what we've pro-rated it for the effective closing date of January 31st. We've also embedded an expectation that our run rate on Hanford and GSM-O will continue with their historic run rates despite these awards being in protest. We've included a minimal level of contribution from NGEN allowing for some potential downside risk reflecting the potential for future protests. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins of 10.0% to 10.2% for the year. After adjusting for the $54 million benefit realized in 2019 from the payment from the Greek government, this reflects, up to 20 basis points of improvement in 2020. We expect non-GAAP EPS between $5.30 and $5.65 on the basis of 144 million shares outstanding, flat with fourth quarter levels. As we've indicated, we are pivoting our capital deployment initiatives to debt reduction, rather than share repurchase until we get our target net leverage ratio close to 3.0x. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance includes approximately $0.20 of accretion from our Dynetics acquisition. We expect operating cash flow of at least $1 billion. This includes a minor contribution from the Dynetics acquisition as the earnings benefit in the first year will be partially offset by transaction and integration costs. These costs which we disclosed previously, are expected to be approximately $40 million in 2020. As I indicated earlier, operating cash flow for 2020 reflects the impact of an approximately $100 million reversal of advanced payments received in 2019. We've also implemented an accounts receivable monetization program for approximately $200 million of our receivables. This further progresses our balance sheet optimization goals. We remain committed to operating with a lean balance sheet and were appropriate monetizing underperforming assets. Now, a couple of other comments to help you with modeling 2020. We expect interest expense of approximately $170 million excluding transaction-related expenses. We are also expecting a slightly higher non-GAAP tax rate in 2020 of 23%. We expect to incur $170 million of capital expenditures in 2020. Now this includes $30 million of real estate-related investment associated with the build out of our new headquarters and other real estate optimization activities. This is the last year where we expect material real estate related investment. Our normalized go forward run rate for CapEx should be about 1.0% of revenue, including the impact from the Dynetics business. To wrap up, we exited the year with strong momentum and tailwinds and a group of 36,000 employees committing - committed to delivering innovative solutions to our customers, driving value for our shareholders and executing on our commitments. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob to take some questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Matt Akers with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Akers : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Roger Krone : Yes, hey, good morning. James Reagan : Hi, Matt. Matthew Akers : Thanks for the color on margins and some of the program mix between mature and new stuff. I guess could you talk about how you sort of think of the long term and talk about the 10% plus EBITDA margins, is that the right way to think of it or is these new acquisitions are a little bit accretive to that, potentially be a little bit higher? James Reagan : Well, Matt, thanks for the question. I think that this year, particularly as we close out 2019, we're seeing the benefit of strong program performance and that's put some nice upward pressure on margins and clearly the two businesses that we've acquired or in the process of acquiring, in the case of the Security Products and Automation businesses, they will also be accretive to our margin profile. So I think that over time as we combine, the strong operational execution, getting some revenue and operating synergies out of the acquired businesses. I think that you're going to see us moving the margin expectation upward. Matthew Akers : Got it, makes sense. And then I guess could you touch on kind of the long term cash from operations guidance, you've talked about the $2.7 billion in 2019 to '21. I think you're - you're already at about $2 billion through 2020. What's the kind of right way to think about that going forward? Roger Krone : Well, you know that three year horizon that we talked about before, we certainly are pleased with our progress on that. I think that because of the advance payment that we mentioned that will be reversing in 2020, that's a bit of a short-term cash flow headwind. That's going to be offset by the fact that we're monetizing about $200 million of our receivables with a very low cost facility that will allow us to show some offsetting uplift in operating cash flow for the year. Matthew Akers : Got it. That helps, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is actually Ellen [ph] on for Sheila. Thank you for taking the question. So, with contracts such as GSM-O and Navy NextGen, which points to your cloud capability, is there any way to frame what the advantages are in this market and any other opportunities that are to deploy this capability for the Army, Air Force through other customers? Roger Krone : Yes. Hey, Ellen and thanks for joining us. Yes, I think our position in that digital landscape is close to the customer and helping the customer utilize the capabilities of the cloud and digital transformation, things like software-defined networks and virtualization and there is opportunity to bring that - those digital transformation capabilities to other customers, the Army, Air Force, frankly, some of the other federal agencies as well. And as we've said before, we're really cloud provider agnostic and where that value-added layer that allows our customers to really modernize and drive efficiency into their day-to-day operations. And so, it's been a great growth market for us and we see it rolling into our healthcare business, our commercial energy business that's been part of our growth engine. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Cai von Rumohr : Yes, thanks so much and good quarter. So if we look at the margins, you mentioned lower initial margins on NextGen and GSM-O. Two questions, one, when do you expect - I mean do you still expect those to reach the corporate average in a couple of years as they mature. And secondly, given those will be below average margins are there any other areas, well, what are the other areas that maybe are a little bit stronger, to get you, home to the 10% plus adjusted EBITDA total? Thanks. Roger Krone : Cai, thanks for the question. When we think of how we want - how we manage the business internally, we manage the thousands of contracts and programs that we have as a portfolio, and we bid things like Navy NextGen, GSM-O with a view that as we begin the process of innovating for new contract, we're going to make those investments with a view that they would get at or above the Company average as they continue to mature beyond the first or second year of the program. So if you think about, and I would just give you some examples. The margin on a program like NASA NEST, which was a takeaway win for us last year, that is already beginning to move upward from that early phase of where we're investing. And so, the larger programs like that typically do have lower margins early on and some of the reserve releases that we've talked about, some of the write-ups that we've had in the fourth quarter are in fact from programs that are maturing and give us the capability to tick up on the profit recognition ratios we have there. And again, it's a function of a lot of programs and I gave you one example in NASA of where the margins escalate over time. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. Edward Caso : Good morning. Congrats on the numbers here. Curious that you seemed, Roger, you seemed more positive on the budget process this year, if I heard right, is there some reason for that, particularly as we go into an election year? And also, if you could talk about your expectation for any cyclical activity and award announcements plus or minus the election? Thank you. Roger Krone : Thanks, Ed, and thanks for joining us. Yes, we've looked back at history and as the end of our first term in the White House and there is a reason to kind of get the budget done before we enter the election cycle in the fall. And as we are up on the hill and talking to authorizers and appropriator certainly at the staff level, they are working hard to get the rest of the budgets complete. I think the President is now set the top level, there seems to be broad agreement at the top level and now the staffs have to do the work to get the budgets done. And I just don't see a lot of appetite for having the budget process roll through the election season. But were there [ph] people who - there are other people who think we'll be in a CR through the end of the year, but I'm more optimistic than that. We do know that we are in what I think is the 130th month of economic expansion in the United States, right. I think the largest period of expansion since the great depression. And I think all of us in business look at that with a careful eye and thinking, okay what could be out in front of us. We look at the coronavirus. We keep our eye on interest rates and, but the economy is running well and we continue to see economic growth. But I think we're all being thoughtful, and that's why clearly at Leidos, we are more conservative in our balance sheet and we like to stay away from the high leverage. That way if we were to see interest rates increase, we would be protected and insulated against that. Edward Caso : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tobey Sommer with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. Tobey Sommer : Thank you. As you look at managing the business beyond just kind of current horizon, maybe think about several years from now, what are the risks associated with higher margin future acquisitions, if margins continue to march higher from this relatively high place here in the fourth quarter over the next two or three years? James Reagan : Tobey, it's an interesting question. I think, if I understand your question right, what is the risk that there could be some interruption in what we view as an environment where we have opportunity to gradually increase margin. And I think that for us, it is more an issue of continued execution and by continue - to continuing to execute well on the existing programs that we have and combine that with realizing the opportunity from the acquisitions that we're making where we think that there is some margin expansion opportunity that's accretive to the overall company, I think that we simply have to execute on the acquisitions that we've made consistent with the playbook that we used when we acquired the IS&GS business and drove 200 basis points of margin expansion out of that. Now, I don't want to - I don't want to make it that like we're setting the bar for that on the deals that we've - that we're doing now, but we certainly believe that there is some opportunity that we can execute on there. Roger Krone : Yes. Hey Tobey, I would answer that, because of our success and how we've grown, there may be people who feel like we have to bid on a broad array of programs, even if they don't meet our expectations for return, and I would simply point out is that even at the size we are today, we have the opportunity to pick and choose what we go after. And as we have said in prior calls, we're being really thoughtful about which businesses we bid on and if we don't see the potential for kind of our corporate average return on a program, we have the strength and the will to not bid those programs. And therefore we feel pretty confident that we can maintain the margins at the current level, then maybe hopefully improve those with some performance. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much. Good morning and good quarter. Just looking at the guidance midpoint on the organic side, it looks like maybe it's kind of 6% to 7-ish in terms of what's baked in there. If you could give us a little help maybe not with the exact guidance, but just kind of slotting the segments relative to that midpoint and talking about what might be the potential areas for upside if you were to outperform? James Reagan : Yes, Seth, this is Jim Reagan. I think that first of all, we, as you know we don't issue guidance by segment. But to your first question, you can think about the organic growth implied by our guidance range being about 7% and that we feel good about the growth that we've experienced across all of the segments of our business in 2019, and because we've had book-to-bills north of 1.0 for all of our segments, all of our businesses where, we remain confident that we'll have strong growth across all of our business segments in 2020. Seth Seifman : Great, thanks. And then I guess when you look at the award opportunities in 2020, I guess what stands out to you as kind of the major opportunities coming up for this year? James Reagan : Well, you know that the lion's share of the growth that we're expecting to experience in 2020 is going to be on the recent program wins. And particularly in the back end of the year we've indicated, there's going to be the beginning of the ramp up of the NGEN program. And the on-contract growth that we've experienced in 2019, which was a significant part of our ability to grow the business, in addition to wins from 2018, things like NASA NEST or the Army Corps of Engineers, IT modernization program. We've had strong growth in health off of the digital health solutions business. Those are the kinds of programs that we think are going to continue to be our growth drivers into 2020. Seth Seifman : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Joe DeNardi with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Ladewig : Hey guys, this is Jon on for Joe. I guess the first question I have is around dim sum. Can you kind of update us on its contribution to organic growth in the quarter and your expectations for the program going into 2022, excuse me 2020? James Reagan : Yes, again detailed program performance and growth rates by quarter, we're not accustomed to giving it. But look, I think it's fair to say that you can think of the growth rate that we've experienced in 2019, about 1 point of that has been because of the uptick in revenues on our dim sum program for the Defense Health Agency. The growth rate there in the coming year is going to be not quite as strong, but still the program is continuing on an upward trajectory. Roger Krone : Yes, I would just add. We're not at the point on the program where we're essentially have four waves and process. So, we're starting one and completing one. Today, we're going from Wave Travis all the way to the Coast Guard pilot and so we expect to keep that pace now for considerable period of time while we roll out the program and put the new electronic healthcare record system at all of the DHA installations. Jonathan Ladewig : Thanks, guys. You also talked a lot about scale and the advantages of scale for Leidos especially with some of these new wins. Can you just kind of touch on what exactly is the scale advantage that you're enjoying today and why it's different today versus in the past, say when you look at old SAIC. What are you guys doing differently now that couldn't be done or wasn't being done back then? Roger Krone : We've always talked about scale in a couple of buckets. We're still very people-oriented, very much a people company and our size and scale allow us to recruit more colleges to have more job fairs to spread more broadly. And that is really, really important in attracting people at college level, mid-level and at the senior levels has really allowed us to fuel our growth. The scale and we talked about, this as a major reason why we did the Lockheed deal 3.5 years ago, is it brought a whole set of new customers, which broadened and diversified our portfolio. And we see that happened again and again every time we do some. We win a new program or we have the inorganic growth. We're thrilled with the broadening of our technical differentiation and the capabilities that we have and what scale allows us to do is to spend our internal R&D money to invest and differentiate those capabilities and then something kind of unique to the government contracting business that maybe commercial customers don't quite understand, but to bid on opportunities in our space, you need to have what we call past performance qualifications, which means you need to have already done that kind of work either for the same customer or for a similar customer. And if you don't have that in your portfolio, oftentimes, you're not even allowed to submit a proposal. And with our broader portfolio we have past performance calls and something called IDIQ contract vehicles, which is a nuance in our industry I won't go into, but we have a lot more of the qualifications that allow us to participate in these broader markets. And we've seen since the IS&GS acquisition, that all of these have contributed to our top line growth. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Gavin Parsons with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Gavin Parsons : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Given you come off 10% organic last year, I think you said 7% next year, obviously you've derisked with a lot of recompete wins. You've got some takeaways, you've got these acquisitions that should be accretive to organic growth. It wasn't too long ago that you kind of guided a 5% organic CAGR going forward on the 2019 to '21. So just curious if you have any updated thoughts there, what's led to such strong outperformance just to '19 alone and just anything going forward there? James Reagan : Yes, there is a couple of things. Gavin, one of them is, we've done a great job this year of hiring and we were - when we were setting our guidance out a year ago, we were thinking of the ability to hire who is being a governor and we've made that a new core competency of the business. The second is on-contract growth. We've done a lot to train our teams to help customers by selling into existing vehicles, help them broaden the kind of mission areas that we address. And then the other thing is that, we have a couple of businesses and really a couple of large contracts that are winding down in the coming year, which are going to be a bit of a headwind in the backdrop of some really strong business development performance in acquiring new and takeaway wins this year. So, I think that it's fair to say that at a midpoint of 7%, organic growth we're being pretty careful in how we measure our ability to continue that string of success and ramp up the new program wins, really fast. Gavin Parsons : That's helpful color. And then maybe just trying scale from a bit of a different angle, I mean, are you seeing that customers structurally shift to larger contracts, whether it'd be put more in kind of say GSA or large IDIQs. Is that a structural shift, that you stand to benefit from? Roger Krone : Yes. Gavin, I think we see that in some customers and then we see other customers who take a large program like the old NMCI. In the Navy, they actually broke that contract into a hardware and a software services and architecture program in the Navy. So, we won - it's called SM-ITY [ph] NGEN program, which is the non-hardware part of the old NMCI. And another contractor won the hardware, and I think each agency looks at their portfolio, and although I think there is a tendency to aggregate there also will be times when they say, okay, maybe we've reached a level of scale and we want to have more players and they disaggregate. So yes, I think in the life cycle, we see both and not necessarily a trend one way or the other. What you do see in the way we behave, because of what we've done with the Company, we tend to look for larger opportunities. And it's interesting, it almost cost you as much money to write, say $250 million proposal as it does to write $1 billion proposal. And if we can take the same resources and pursue larger opportunities, we can be more efficient in the dollars that we spend, we call it our new business fund spend. And so, we have been doing that over the last couple of years. Gavin Parsons : Got it. And then just quickly off - do you have your 2020 or 2021 recompete rate? Thank you. James Reagan : We don't issue or, we don't disclose the recompete win rates, or for that matter for new business or takeaways, what we have said in the past and it continues to be true is that our win rates on all of those categories are well above, are above 50% this year. The recompetes are going to contribute about 20% of our - the things that are being bid in the coming year will be responsible for about 20% of our overall revenue. Gavin Parsons : Okay. Thank you. James Reagan : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Colin Canfield : Hey guys, it's Colin Canfield on for Jon. Appreciate you taking the question. Just going back to that comments before new programs versus segment average margin. Can you just discuss a little bit the assumptions that you guys have with respect to the geography of labor and how you guys are able to offset some of the cost of that by distributing the labor to kind of non-core areas? Roger Krone : Let's see, I think you asked - let me on the answer the question, I want to answer. But although we have a customer concentration in the national capital region and there are some contracts that require us to perform work within a certain geographical radius of those customers. We have had success in moving work outside of these sort of dense economic areas to places where the job market is better and we have been doing that over the past couple of years and we continue to do that in '19 and in '20. And we have built new facilities, we call them centers of excellence and software development. We kind of refer to them as software factories but open, planned new buildings in places around the country, near major research colleges and universities that have outstanding computer science programs. And we have enjoyed success and capturing students and graduate students and allowing them to participate in our secured DevOps process and our agile software development, I think that has been really, really successful for us and we have seen some signs open up down the street with some of our competitors names on them. So, I think it is a trend that we're seeing within the government contracting space. Colin Canfield : Got it. Thank you for the color. And then in terms of the larger contracts, right, were you guys doing both software and hardware? Can you just talk a little bit about, say for example NGEN, right, and getting to the Company average margin by year two? Could you just talk a little bit about the like risks with regards to hardware implementation that might affect that comment? Roger Krone : Well, in the Navy NextGen they actually split the contract into two pieces. There is a hardware contract, which we didn't participate in. I think it was won by HP, and they will provide the hardware and unlike our NASA Nest program where we did both and we actually brought the hardware and we buy some existing hardware and do a technology refresh. On the Navy NextGen program, we don't have that hardware component in our contract. Ours is around architecture and transforming the network. And so, there's really - there is no pass-through, there's really no hardware implementation risk. And you're oftentimes in government contracting if you're simply passing through hardware, sometimes you're not allowed to put fee on that, sometimes the fee rate is less. And that is not the case on our Navy NextGen contract. Colin Canfield : Got it. Thanks for confirming that. Appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the floor back to Kelly Hernandez for closing remarks. Kelly Hernandez : Thank you, Rob. Thank you all for your time this morning and for your interest in Leidos. We look forward to updating you again soon. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the conference over to Peter Berl, Investor Relations. Mr. Berl, you may begin. Peter Berl : Thank you, Rob and good morning, everyone. I would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of the Leidos management team. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter ending April 3, 2020. Roger will lead off the call with notable highlights from the quarter as well as comments on the market environment and our Company's strategy. Jim will follow with a discussion of our financial performance and our guidance expectations. After these remarks from Roger and Jim, we will open the call for your questions. Today's discussion contains Forward-Looking Statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific Risk Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, during the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in the press release that we issued this morning and is also available in the presentation slides. The press release and presentation as well as supplementary financial information file are provided on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.leidos.com. With that I will turn the call over to Roger Krone. Roger Krone : Thank you all for joining us this morning for our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. These are challenging times for all of us. And I sincerely hope that each of you and your families are both safe and healthy. First Quarter results demonstrated the resiliency of our business, as evidenced by strong pro forma organic revenue growth across all business segments, significant bookings and a new record backlog position. While the COVID-19 pandemic presented some late quarter headwinds, we are confident that the critical nature of our work, coupled with our early business contingency planning will mitigate any long-term impacts. In the quarter, the business delivered revenue of 2.89 billion, reflecting 12.1% growth from the prior year, adjusting for acquisitions and divestiture activity, the pro forma organic growth rate was 8.2% demonstrating the continued conversion of our successful business development campaigns to revenues. We delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.19 up 5.3% from the prior year. We generated $372 million of cash from operations and ended the quarter with a strong cash balance of $445 million. Net bookings of 5.5 billion yielded a book-to-bill of 1.9 for the quarter, a significant achievement compared to our historical pattern. With several recent favorable protests wrote resolutions on single award IDIQs. We expect additional bookings, as incremental task orders are awarded against these vehicles later in the year. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.3% was lower than prior year. Primary factors were late quarter COVID-19 headwinds, and a charge related to an international receivable. The impact of COVID-19 in the first quarter was approximately 15 million in revenue and nine million in non-GAAP operating income. As discussed during the fourth quarter earnings call. We closed the Dynetics acquisition back on January 31st. The integration activities are progressing as planned on a pro forma basis, Dynetics delivered approximately 30% top-line growth in the quarter, demonstrating that businesses strength in fast growing strategic areas such as hypersonics, space exploration in unmanned systems. Just last week, Dynetics was awarded one of three prime contracts by NASA under the Artemis program to develop a human landing system through the preliminary design phase. Our contract consists of two phases, a 10-month base period for preliminary design valued north of 250 million, followed by a down-select to two contractors for a four year option period to build and send a lander to the moon. This win will be captured in our second quarter bookings and backlog. Following the theme of M&A activity, yesterday we announced the closing of the acquisition of L3Harris' security detection and automation business. We are excited about what this acquisition means for our future in a high growth ever expanding global security market. While COVID-19 is causing a temporary impact on airlines and airport traffic volumes, the lower traffic scenarios are actually causing many airports to consider pulling in upgrades and maintenance activity during this unseasonably slow traffic period. After careful review of first quarter results and the business' pipeline including recent discussions with key customers and prospects, we remain confident that this transaction will create significant value for Leidos, our customers and our shareholders. We welcomed the 1200 employees to the Leidos family and look forward to updating you on our integration and synergy activities overtime. We continue to expect this acquisition to be accretive to revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margins and earnings this year. Jim will provide more details on this later in his remarks. As of today reflecting both acquisitions our estimated net leverage ratio is 3.7, as we have stated consistently in the past. Our target net leverage ratio is 3.0 and as such, our capital deployment philosophy will prioritize debt reduction until we approach that level while sustaining our quarterly dividend and funding important capital and R&D investments to continue to drive growth. From an organic growth perspective, I would like to highlight a couple of notable programs from the quarter that reflects the successful defense of two protests in our defense solutions segment and one in our civil segment. In all three cases, Leidos is the incumbent. The first is the Global Solutions Management Operations or GSM-O contract where we continue to manage a series of networks and computer systems that serve as the backbone of the department of defense commanding control systems. This 10-year single award IDIQ contract has a ceiling value of 6.5 billion if all options are exercised. Note, that the GSM-O II contract has yet to contribute materially to our backlog and will do so overtime as new task orders are issued. Second, the protest of the Department of Energy's Hanford Mission Essential Services contract was also resolved in our favor. The 10-year single award IDIQ contract has an approximate value of four billion if all options are exercised. Finally, the Air Force National Capital Region or ASMCR, Information Technology Service Support contract was also successfully defended. Under this five year, 450 million single award IDIQ contract, we will continue to provide a full range of support and services to our nation\u2019s command and control systems and IT support for thousands of users. During the COVID-19 crisis we are enabling teleworking capabilities through hardware software and cloud-based service deployments. To support our businesses' continuing growth, our talent acquisition efforts continue to attract and hire 100 or more new employees each week. We hired over 1800 in the first quarter. This result is made possible by our recruiting and on-boarding programs, which adopted a number of virtual practices well before the current COVID-19 crisis. Turning now to COVID-19. This global pandemic is affecting us all. At Leidos, we have been carefully managed the impacts to our people, our community, our business partners and our customers. We have implemented changes to our business rhythms to maximize telework where possible and minimize risk to our employees. We have revisited and improved certain healthcare benefits for our employees to minimize the burden on them and their families during the crisis. I\u2019m proud to report that the whole Leidos family from employees up to the board have stepped up to offer aid in their communities through generous donations. Since the start of the outbreak, employees have donated nearly $400,000 to the Leidos Relief Foundation to assist their colleagues who have been directly impacted by the virus. Last week, our board of directors unanimously approved a reduction in director compensation for the current year. As a result of this decision, the Company will contribute $0.5 million dollars to the Relief Foundation. Additionally, I have donated my salary to the Relief Foundation during the pandemic. Externally the Company has contributed more than $250,000 with a commitment to match up to an additional $1 million of employee donations to the all of us combat Coronavirus campaign created by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Foundation. Our customers recognize the critical nature of the services that we perform and the overwhelming majority of our work remains without impact. We have identified approximately $270 million of revenue or about 2% of our total for 2020 that is expected to be impacted by COVID-19. Much of which we expect to recover in 2021. The passage of the CAREs Act does provide some relief for us in our industry peers. However, since this specific implementation is left to the discretion of contracting officers, we are not allowed to build fee on certain contracts where the workforce is kept at home in a ready state. This is the cause for the majority of margin reduction in the defense solutions segment. To minimize business impacts and to continue to deliver innovative solutions in a cost- efficient manner, we have implemented a number of cost cutting measures across the organization. These actions include reduced discretionary spending, an indirect hiring freeze of non-essential open positions, and mandatory time off on alternating Fridays for indirect staff. In a few minor areas, where we have seen reduced business volumes, furloughs have been implemented. Beyond this is worth highlighting that Leidos supports many customers who are in the news today for their efforts on addressing the pandemic, including NIH, CDC, FDA and others. We are unique among our peers in the breadth of our health capabilities and have been engaged with all of these customers and more to leverage our capabilities to directly help combat the pandemic. First, on behalf of the NIH is National Cancer Institute, our subsidiary Leidos Biomedical Research staffs and operates the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, which is dedicated exclusively to the biomedical sciences. Frederick National Laboratory\u2019s scientists have been working directly with the NIH to facilitate an international therapeutic trial of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients. Second the Frederick National Laboratory scientists are also conducting research to identify genetic determinants of virus susceptibility and outcomes, hopefully of leading to better therapeutics and medicines to combat the virus. In other parts of our health business, we have been exploring opportunities to develop and offer virtual care solutions, which support the complete pandemic pathway from patient intake and pre-screening to virtual visits with staff physicians via remote monitoring within the hospital, or other care environments. While these are challenging times for all of us, the mission essential nature of our work, the additional protective measures in the CARES Act, and the significant actions we are taking as a company provide a strong foundation for our business as we manage headwinds entering the second quarter. Jim will give more detail on our revised guidance, but in short, after reflecting both the expected COVID-19 impacts, as well as offsets from the inclusion of the L3Harris Security acquisition, our revised guidance enables us to maintain our cash flow from operations guidance at the same level as before at $1 billion or higher, while decreasing revenue by 1% and earnings per share by 6%, at the midpoint of our range. From a macro perspective, fiscal year 2021\u2019s budget levels for both defense and non-defense spending are set under the bipartisan budget agreement. And Congress does not plan to change those levels, despite the unprecedented spending increases being enacted to offset the economic impact of COVID-19. Consequentially, there should be more certainty in the budget process this year, even though we expect fiscal year 2021 to start undoing by continuing resolution due to the November elections. Longer term, however, deficit pressures could impact both defense and domestic spending levels, potentially starting as early as fiscal year 2023. But again, the 18 to 24 months delay from budget dollars to outlay dollars, does still provide us with runway before we are potentially faced with that dynamic. Further, DoDs unobligated balance of over 100 billion could mitigate the impact of any future cuts to budget authority in the first one to two years of a downturn scenario. Finally, in closing, I would like to comment briefly on the transition in our Investor Relations team. Peter Berl was recently appointed as Head of our IIR team and brings over 25-years of experience across numerous financial departments within Lockheed Martin and Leidos where he most recently served as CFO of our Health Group. Peter succeeds, Kelly Hernandez, who after six years is our IR lead was recently named the new CFO of our Civil Group. I would like to thank Kelly for her many contributions in her prior role. I know she will be a great asset to the Civil Group. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim Reagan our Chief Financial Officer for more details on our first quarter results and our full-year outlook. James Reagan : Thank you Roger and thanks for everyone joining us on the call today. I will start by sharing some highlights from the quarter and then I will provide some color on what we see as the potential impacts on COVID-19 for the remainder of the year in the context of our updated guidance. Beginning with revenue we are pleased with our strong start to the year. First quarter revenues grew 12.1% over the prior year and 8.2% organically continuing our growth momentum into 2020. The increase in revenue was driven by high levels of on-contract growth and increased contributions from new programs that ramped up during the quarter. These increases were offset by a slowdown programs related to COVID-19 which caused an approximately $50 million impact to the quarter\u2019s revenue. Excluding this first quarter, organic growth would have been 10% over the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 9.3% declined 80 basis points from the prior year quarter. The declines characterized by two events. The first was what I would characterize broadly as COVID-19 related particularly impactful in our Defense Solutions segment program's ability to perform coupled with the inability to recognize fee on the maintenance of ready state labor. This impact is approximately $9 million to adjusted EBITDA. The second item is an $8 million charge related to an international receivable. After adjusting for these discrete items, adjusted EBITDA margins would have been more in-line with historic company levels. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter increased $0.06 cents over the prior year to a $19 primarily reflecting a lower non-gap effective tax rate and lower share count. Operating cash flows of 372 million were above seasonal norms and reflects the continued diligent management of our working capital as well as the implementation of the accounts receivable monetization facility, which we discussed previously, which contributed nearly 140 million in the quarter. We had another strong quarter in business development resulting in bookings of over 5.5 billion bringing our book-to-bill for the quarter to 1.9x and a record ending backlog position of 28.3 billion. This outstanding backlog number reflects the successfully defended protests on the Hanford and AFNCR contracts as well as our continued success in competing for new programs and take away opportunities. Before I get into segment results, I would like to point out that effective at the start of 2020 we reassigned several programs from the Civil Reportable Segment to the Defense Solutions Reportable Segment to better align segment operations with the customers they serve. And that impact was, that program's worth a total of about one billion of annual revenue moved out of Civil and into the Defense Solution Segment. The 2019 financials have been recast to reflect the new structure for a year-over-year comparison, and have been provided to you in the supplementary financials file on our website. Now for an overview of our segment results. Defend Solution Segment revenue grew 14.4% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting 5.7% organic growth and two months of contribution from Dynetics. On a pro forma basis for the full quarter Dynetics experienced approximately 30% growth compared to the prior year period. These strong growth rates take into account COVID-19 impacts that affected some of our intelligence programs in the latter part of the first quarter. We expect these programs to return to their normal run rates during the third quarter. Non-GAAP operating margins of 6.8% in our Descent Solutions Segment are uncharacteristically low, declining 120 basis points from the prior year quarter. The current quarter margins reflect $7 million associated with programs impacted by COVID-19. An increase in indirect expenditures and a reserve for a potential $8 million receivables write down on an international program. Defense Solutions booked over $1 billion of net awards, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.8x in the quarter and 1.6x on a trailing 12 month basis. The recent successful resolution of the protest on the GSM-O II contracts has not yet impacted these metrics due to our booking methodology. However, as we receive task orders on this IDIQ contract later in the year, the backlog will reflect those new bookings. In our civil segment, revenues grew 5% from the prior year quarter and 6.9% organically. This growth was driven by the increased contribution from the ramp up of new programs and volume growth on our existing programs. This growth was partially offset by the sale of our commercial cyber business last year. Non-GAAP operating margins in the Civil Segment were strong at 10.9%. The prior year's margin was 12.4% reflected a number of non-recurring items that resulted in a higher than usual and that a write ups combined with higher volume in our Security and Transportation Systems business. While the first quarter of 2020 saw lower product volumes and mix, we look forward to driving more value in this higher margin segment with the addition of the L3Harris Security Detection and Automation businesses. Civil generated nearly $4 billion in net bookings in the quarter for a book-to-bill of 6.1x. This was largely driven by the positive impact from the successful resolution of the protest on the Hanford contract. And finally, turning to our health segment. Revenues grew 14.5% over the prior year period 18.5% organically after adjusting for the divestiture of the commercial staff augmentation business. This strong organic growth was due primarily to increased program volumes and expansion of scope on our existing programs. Non-GAAP operating income for the health segment grew 360 basis points to 15.5% from the prior year quarter, due to a shift in program mix. Our health segment saw approximately $250 million in bookings in the quarter driving a book-to-bill is 0.5x with a trailing 12 months book to build a 0.9x. And now on to the remainder of the year. We are updating our 2020 guidance for revenue adjusted EBITDA margin and non-GAAP diluted EPS to include the addition of the L3Harris Security Detection and Automation businesses and the expected impacts to our business from COVID-19. We are adjusting our revenue guidance to a range of $12.5 billion to $12.9 billion. The updated range reflects 13% to 16% growth over the prior year. This range includes approximately $290 million in revenue contribution from the security detection and automation businesses offset by approximately $370 million of expected impact from COVID-19 and other associated market uncertainties. Note that we expect our COVID impacted programs to ramp back up to our normalized run rates during the second quarter, resuming full run rate in the fourth quarter and then continuing un-impacted into 2021. We also anticipate that we will start to make up some of the lost revenue from Q1 and Q2 during the latter half of 2020 and into early 2021 as employees are able to return to previously closed customer work locations. With the abatement of the COVID-19 impacts beyond the fourth quarter, combined with the strength of our backlog and recent awards position, we are confident that we will achieve high single-digit organic growth in 2021 with margins at or above our 10% adjusted EBITDA margin long term target. In terms of margins, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins of 9.8% to 10% for this year. The primary drivers of the 20 basis point reduction from the prior range included includes an estimated value of approximately 30 basis points associated with COVID-19 offset by the approximate 10 basis point increase from the inclusion of the security detection and automation revenues at accretive margins. Specifically, COVID-19 is impactful from a margin perspective in a few different ways. First, the revenue headwinds we are currently experiencing in our higher margin generating businesses. We expect to begin increasing our volumes back to normal run rates in these portfolios beginning in the second quarter. Second, some of our customers are only reimbursing costs and not fees associated with maintaining ready state labor on certain programs. This is impacting margins on some intelligence programs within the Defense Solutions Segment. And third, as mentioned earlier, we expect to begin ramping back to our historical run rate and margin mix across the enterprise beginning in the second quarter of 2020. Our expectation is that we will be at normalized margins in the fourth quarter and continuing into 2021. These revenue and margin changes result in an updated non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance range of $5 to $5.30. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance range includes modest accretion from the SG&A transaction. And we expect the accretion from the transaction to increase beyond 2020 as we undertake integration activities and begin to realize revenue and cost synergies. As Roger indicated, our guidance for operating cash flows remains unchanged at one billion or more for the year. As a reminder, our capital deployment efforts are focused on debt reduction, rather than share repurchases until we approach our target net leverage ratio of 3.0x, which we expect to do by the end of the first quarter of 2021. Let me provide you with a couple of additional comments to help you with modeling. We expect net interest expense for the full-year of 197 million inclusive of the L3Harris Security Detection and Automation transaction. We also expect a slightly lower non-GAAP tax rate in 2020 of 22%. Before we turn it over for questions, I would like to mention that for the third consecutive year, Leidos has been recognized as one of the 2020 World's Most Ethical Companies by the Ethisphere Institute, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices. Leidos is one of only 132 honorees from 21 countries and 51 industries to receive this recognition and this award would not have been possible without each and every one of our employees committing to do what is right every day. With that, I will turn the call over to Rob, so we can take some questions. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Jon Raviv with City Group. Please proceed with your questions. Jon Raviv : Hey, thanks. Good morning everyone. Roger, you talked about some of these items of there is demand disruption and then potentially some areas there could be demand disruption. Can you parse between those two dynamics? It sounds like it is mostly disruption, but you did mention some potential shortfalls that it could be with us for longer? Roger Krone : Okay. I'm trying to understand your question. Let me take a shot and if I don't get it. I think we were pretty clear both Jim and I that we don't see significant long-term impact as a result of COVID-19, which is what I think your question was. Most what we saw a little bit in Q1, but mostly in the month of April, except for the [3610] (Ph) fee, which we will never get back because we are only being reimbursed for costs not fee. We see almost all of that revenue when therefore earnings just moving to the right and we will either pick it up in third quarter or fourth quarter or in a roll into 2021. For instance, as you all know, we do a lot of work at hospitals, right. Our Defense Health program is installing the new millennium software and hospitals. Those hospitals are now being used for COVID-19 even those at military basis. As such, we are not getting access to the hospital right now. And so we are slowing down our deployment, but those deployments will still occur. They just move to the right by a quarter or so. And so in some program we will pick back up. In fact, it is already starting to gain momentum again and should be fully back in third or fourth quarter. So John, I don't believe I said that we saw permanent impairment of our business. And if you heard that in my comments, then I apologize. Clearly we have seen impact in the month of April, but the vast majority of our impact is either the earnings we lose on 3610 or revenue and earnings that have been delayed. Back to you Jon. Jon Raviv : Thanks, Roger. I didn't mean to imply that you said, I just want to make sure we are perfectly clear on the disruption idea here. But I was getting at though and a real quick follow-up here is just, you did bring up the idea that going forward, how maybe in 2023, 2024, 2025 let's say, deficit starts to become more of an issue, discretionary spending could be pressured. I mean, you are a big business, but you are also operating in a big market. How do you think about the Company positioning for what that long-term spending environment could be? Because it is still going to be mission essential spending. But, how do you position for those parties and essentially what those priorities are going to be? Roger Krone : Yes, Jon we are really pleased with how we have repositioned the business over the last five years to be in parts of the market that we think are more resilient to what will be eventually a cyclical flattening of government spending. We have moved into mission essential digital transformation areas and have diversified from our concentration in DoD to where we now have essentially our four markets and defense until health and civil infrastructures. So we are really pleased with how we have restructured the company and how we have positioned ourselves for the markets going forward. And if the Department of Defense slows in growth, I think we will see a lot of civil infrastructure projects. How we do inspection at airports, is going to change with social distancing. And we are well positioned to take advantage of shifts and spending in that direction. Jon Raviv : Thank you. Operator : Next question is from the line of Matt Akers with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Matt Akers : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I wonder if you could comment a little bit on the security detection business. I know, Roger, I think you mentioned you may be seeing some demands for forward during this fiscal period. But I mean, how much of that business you think of is kind of tied to sort of air travel run-rate and kind of just seeing sort of an unprecedented downturn there. And so how much of it is sort of that versus kind of longer cycle stuff that you have for booked already? Roger Krone : Yes, over the period of signing to closing. We have gone out and touched all of our traditional long-term customers and the new long-term customers that come to us by way of the L3Harris acquisition. We really wanted to understand what their capital spending plans were and what their view of technology was. And, again to U.S. this is funded through TSA. There are some markets where the inspection function is funded by ticket surcharges and it is a mix as you go country-to-country. What we heard across the board was movement in new technologies, social distancing at checkpoints, CT scanning, the addition of biometrics, which very, very few airport checkpoints have today whether that be facial recognition, temperature scanning. And really what has gotten us excited is I think this is going to spondee a recapitalization of checkpoints. We were talking to one customer that said we put ultraviolet lights in the tray return conveyor so that we could sanitize the tray as it comes back around and is presented to the next traveler. All of that is capital investments, all of that really plays well with the L3Harris business that we have gotten. And of course, our traditional business was very strong in ports and borders. And this only accelerates the need to do inspection at the ports and borders as we want to have control of the border. But we want to be able to tell you not only who is coming across, but now there are some aspects about do they have a temperature, things like that. So we were very, very excited about the L3Harris business, back when we signed the deal in early February, and the world events have only made us more excited. Matt Akers : Great, thanks. That is helpful. And I guess just one other on MHS GENESIS there has been you know a couple of press reports that there may be some delays in that program. Are those impacting you? And what sort of the run rate that you guys are at on that program long-term? Roger Krone : As I made my comment to Jon, because those hospitals and even the ones that military bases have been dedicated to COVID-19, or at least put in a ready state. So we have had to do more work off-Prem to get ready for deployments. And we are doing some other work on behalf of DHA as well with our team. But there has been an impact that we have seen slowing of our deployment. Maybe I will let Jim comment. James Reagan : Yes. As you know there was supposed to be a peak in the deployment activity late this year early next. And now with the rescheduling, it is clearly that peak has been pushed out into 2021 as we re-jigger our scheduled to accommodate the use of the hospitals for COVID-19 patients. Matt Akers : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Roger Krone : Thanks Matt. James Reagan : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go with your question. Robert Spingarn : Hi, good morning. Roger Krone : Hey, good morning, Rob. James Reagan : Good morning, Rob. Robert Spingarn : Rob, you talked about the work that you do with NIH that directly touches on the pursuit of a cure or therapeutic for COVID-19. Could you talk about the materiality of that revenue where it stands now? And could that be a meaningful needle mover as we move forward? And then really, as a follow-up to that higher level, how should the market think about Leidos given that you have a healthcare segment? And just the long-term ramifications of the federal response to this disease. Roger Krone : Okay. Let me start with the easy one. The work we do at the Frederick National Laboratory for cancer research is part of our FFRD support contract and although we believe it is very, very important to the country, and it is a great past performance call for us. It has a never been for $12 billion, $13 billion company, a material set of numbers. So it is just not - and it has to do with the way that contract for FFRD are structured, and how we book. That being said, the work we believe is highly important and it provides credibility for us across our healthcare segment. And longer term we like being in the healthcare sector. We view that as a significant growth more market for us. It is, as you all have seen, our highest margin market, which says our customers value what we bring to the market there. And we continue to invest and to grow in that marketplace. And your question about the federal response. I will make this statement and I\u2019m really proud of what the organizations that we work with have done in response to the pandemic. This is unprecedented and unpredicted and every organization that we work with, whether they are at NIH or NCI or frankly, our DoD and Intel customers have all leaned forward. We are doing virtual customer meetings by phone. We are doing Zoom Chats and across the board, there are a lot of people who are critical out there is not us. We are thrilled with all the hard work that all of our customers have done to try to keep our workforce employed and paid and to combat the pandemic and to take care of their employees and our employees. Robert Spingarn : I guess where I was going with that Roger was, once we are through this, if they set up some kind of a federal pandemic office to try and prepare differently, let's say for next time. How much of an advantage are you - does Leidos have versus the competition, given that you are already in the healthcare IT arena? Roger Krone : Let's see, we think we have a significant advantage. I\u2019m part of why we do FFRDC work is to have knowledge of the environment and how therapeutics are created and how vaccines are created. Rob, as you may know, we are heavily involved in the Ebola vaccine and the worldwide effort to eradicate Ebola off the face of the planet. And although it doesn't generate significant profit the way some of our other large programs do, it gives us great credibility as we pivot to support what very well may be a federal response - a permanent federal response to future potential pandemics. Robert Spingarn : Thank you. Roger. Roger Krone : Thank you. Operator : Next questions comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Cai von Rumohr : Yes, thank you very much. So Roger, you talked about $270 million of COVID impact. And yet the guide has 370, which would imply about $100 million for other 'market certainties'. Could you give us some color on what those other market uncertainties are? And then of the $270 of COVID-related, walk us through some more specifics like the dim-some impact and some sense of the quarterly pattern. Because it would suggest the COVID impacts can be bigger in the second quarter than the first year. Roger Krone : Yes Cai, let me get started on that and I will let Jim pick up what I don't talk about. So the 270 is that from a bottoms up, we can tie directly to COVID-19. So 3610 CAREs act, slow down on dim-some. When we touch guidance, we sit back and go, Okay, what are the unknown unknowns?  And although it hasn't happened yet, we think some of the procurements are going to slow down, and there is just going to be a little bit more drag on the business writ large. And when we touch guidance, we felt it was prudent to put another 100 million of revenue headwind in our guidance, and it is not specific. And I can't go into the additional, the 270, we can almost go contract-by-contract and Jim may touch on the major pieces there. The additional 100 for us is, I actually thought we were going to get an NDA this year. And now I don't think we will. I think we will be in a continuing resolution. So our forecasts are seeing a continued growing federal budgets and things operating in a normal way. And now I don't think that is going to happen, I think, procurement will slow down, the things will take longer, meetings take an extra week or two, there is no travel. And we wanted to put in another 100 million of headwind to get us to a midpoint, which was indeed our 50/50. A little bit of a quarter-by-quarter, Cai we don't guide by quarter. That being said, April must be the worst month, given what we all have been through. We have already seen, state start to reopen here in Virginia, the governor is talking about opening next week and non-essential. So we think that it May will be better and June will be even better. But if you are starting to face - now you know our first quarter, there is just no doubt that second quarter is going to be the quarter that is the most impacted. And then we expect, as Jim said in his comments, to be fully recovered, or maybe be better than by fourth quarter. Jim do you want to add some color. James Reagan : Yes. Just a couple more comments. Rob, you characterized it exactly that 100 million is the piece of our revision that does not have any specific contracts tied to it, but it is that out of what we - Cai as you know, we try to be pretty conservative in how we guide and it was we thought the prudent thing to do. Some color on a couple of contracts we mentioned dim-sum. There is also, for example, we support the National Science Foundation in the Antarctic. The Antarctic is the one continent that has no COVID-19 today and they want to keep it that way. And so they have slowed down the level of activity that we are going to have down on the ice for the balance of the year and so that is - now there are some big programs down there that we are going to manage. And so that is what is into 2021, like a lot of these impacts. And then there is a part of our business a couple of contracts that have a lot of fixed costs, and they are also fixed unit price. And that downdraft that is going to be temporary in the second quarter, obviously, is going to impact both revenue and margin in Q2. That said, those customers that procure those products and services from us, have already contacted us about their restart plans. And we are working with them closely to begin re-ramping back in the second quarter. And we expect that we will be in much better shape there on the third. Cai von Rumohr : Very helpful. So you mentioned protests, could you update us on the next gen protests, and also the UNH Defense Health takeaway win? Roger Krone : Yes, well you know right now, we are in the throes of finishing and have recently finished all the back and forth and responses on the engine protest. And right now we continue to expect that that will be concluded in the second quarter. And as we said before, we are pretty confident of that outcome. And that would result in a booking in Q2. And do you have another one in mind, Cai? I'm sorry. Cai von Rumohr : Just UNH Defense Health. Take away when? Roger Krone : Is that the reserve health program, Cai? Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Roger Krone : Or [RHRP] (Ph). Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Roger Krone : Yes. We call that our RHRP. Right. Well, that is in protest as well. So and two more months from where we are. James Reagan : Yes. And that should also be resolved by the end of the second quarter Cai, and so we will have something to say about that on our next call as well. Cai von Rumohr : Thanks so much. Roger Krone : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. Edward Caso : Hi, good morning. Roger Krone : Good morning Ed. James Reagan : Good morning. Edward Caso : I was wondering how much of your revenue guidance is a function of requests for equitable adjustments, if that is a meaningful factor that you need to recapture? James Reagan : Ed, this is Jim. The REAs right now are in the forecast very conservatively like zero. It is not our habit to include those in revenue projections mainly because the timing of resolution of those is pretty difficult. With that said, we have had a number of customers, I can think of one customer in the Health Group and a couple of customers in the Defense segment that has invited us to prepare a request for equitable adjustment for things like the fee on COVID standby labor pre-March 27th, which isn't provided specifically in the CAREs Act. But our customers do understand that there is some significant loss of profit. So the pursuit and successful closure of REAs, if it happens this year would result in some upside to the numbers that we have out there. Edward Caso : Great. Can you also talk a little bit about your clients' behavior on a word activity and whether you are seeing bridges and extensions in the current environment? Thanks. Roger Krone : Ed, thanks. I will start on that. To-date they have awarded pretty much on time And almost to our surprise, and like the human lander program out of NASA really was right on schedule. That being said, part of the $100 million that we add into our revenue guidance is conservatism on our part that may not continue as we go throughout the summer. And just the RFP process where maybe we used to do oral face-to-face and now we are going to have to do orals by video. We just think that is going to take longer. But as through today, we have not really seen anything that I would call an appreciable delay. And in fact, on our L3Harris deal or Hart Scott, we got early termination. So the government is up and operating and things are moving forward. Edward Caso : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of this Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your questions. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much and good morning. I was curious on the airport security acquisition, there were the presentation that you guys did when the deal was announced back in January I think, when you look at that now, should we still be thinking about the same types of numbers for around for 2020 and the out years or kind of when you look at things after the cause? James Reagan : Yes, thanks for the question Seth. When we took a look at this business, most before COVID and really very recently, in doing our due diligence update, we saw that the business was up through the beginning of COVID. The business was outperforming our own projections and pipeline and backlog as we recently looked at it still looks good. As Roger mentioned, we had an opportunity to touch-base with many of their major customers. And we were pleased that they are continuing with much of their plans. And in fact, we are thinking about how to reconfigure some of the systems that the L3Harris business has already sold to accommodate the need for more lanes, for example, because of the need for slower testing, as airline customers go through security dimensions by the way of example. Now with that said, there will undoubtedly be some slowdown in the revenue and just because of the inability in the short run to get some of the work done, but it hasn't changed our view of what the order backlog of the business is. So, and those provisions have been incorporated into our guide for that business for the rest of the year. Roger Krone : Yes Seth. I just want to add, if you were going to take a word out of what we have heard, the word touch less is what we are hearing from customers about the transit of passengers through security checkpoints. And every customer we have talked to is said, we have been doing this in a highly personal, highly contacted environment. And going forward, we don't want to put, for instance in the U.S. our TSA agents at risk, and we don't want to contact the travelling public and if you recall your experience back when we all flew, depending upon what happens, you were touched, and especially if you get a pat down, you might be touched three or four times through the checkpoint, and that is just going to be unacceptable going forward. So the TSA agents not going to want to hold your driver's license, right? They are going to want a another way of verifying who you are. You are going to put your material in a bin, before you put material in another bin, you want to know that bin is sanitized, right? If you need it be go through a secondary, you want to do a secondary in a way where a TSA agent doesn't actually have to make a contact with you. That means CT at the checkpoint. So a lot of great application of technology to the checkpoint of the future and again, we are excited about the opportunity to grow the business that we bought. Seth Seifman : Okay. Thanks that is all I have. Operator : Next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Hi. Good morning, Roger and Jim and thank you for the time. Roger, I wanted to follow-up on Bob's question with regarding the healthcare opportunity. Not only on health care, but maybe IT infrastructure just given government employees are also working from home. Kind of where are we in terms of timing with these opportunities? When do they emerge? Are we in step one in terms of tracking and tracing? Maybe Can you talk about that? Roger Krone : Let me start with the easiest and that which we have already seen a positive impact. Sheila as you know we provide IT infrastructure and digital transformation for a whole host of government customers from CMS to the Pentagon. We are the telework provider for a significant part of the government. In fact, I will recount a story a agency director elected to work at home. And that director had never worked at home before. And we are the infrastructure for that particular agency. And so we facilitated that individual's work at home. We configured a laptop, we made sure that he had enough bandwidth at home, we provided user support and that has been going on across our IT transformation contracts. And that is immediate. It is not really in our guide. And we really don't know how it is going to come down to the bottom line, but we are seeing that across the board and even more so in the health world. Telemedicine is going to be a big deal. And we view that both in the short-term and the long-term. And then I think, John's question was where or Rob\u2019s was really focused on, we used to have a pandemic working group and that team just gone away. We all know that is going to come back. And we have seen a global viral outbreak every seven to 10-years. So we know this is not here - there will be a COVID-25. And we expect that the federal government and organizations like NIH and NIAID will mobilize to put in a better response capability. And I think for us, that is a significant growth opportunity. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay, thank you. And then maybe one follow-up on defense. When we add back that international receivable margins are still around the low 7%. So it implies a bit of a ramp. What is going on in terms of profitability in that segment? James Reagan : Yes, Sheila the profitability in the Defense Group while we did have that unusual item, we had to record. If you take a look back in Q4, you might recall that we had a big write up on a couple of programs in Q4. We keep thinking of that as being a business that should be running longer term eight-ish or a little north of eight. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay. Alright. Thank you very much. Roger Krone : Thank you. James Reagan : Thanks Sheila. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we have reached the end of our question and answer session and I will hand the call back to Peter Berl for closing comments. Peter Berl : Thank you, Rob. Thank you all for your time this morning and for your interest in Leidos. Look forward to updating you again soon. Have a great day. Operator : This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I will now turn the conference over to Peter Berl of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Peter Berl : Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of the Leidos management team. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter ending July 3, 2020. Roger will lead off the call with notable highlights from the quarter as well as comments on the market environment and our Company's strategy. Jim will follow with a discussion of our financial performance and our guidance expectations. After these remarks from Roger and Jim, we will open the call for your questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific Risk Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, during the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in the press release that we issued this morning and is also available in the presentation slides. The press release and presentation as well as supplementary financial information file are provided on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.leidos.com. With that, I will turn the call over to Roger Krone. Roger Krone : Thank you. Peter, and thank you all for joining us this morning for our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. As we continue to navigate through these difficult times as a country and as a global community, I hope each of you are well and your families safe. Leidos second quarter results demonstrate the resiliency of our business model, the value of our market diversity and the strength of our team as we delivered on commitments through the most challenging quarter I have seen in my career. We exited 2Q with a strong business capture win rate, record setting backlog, resilient cash position and improved capital structure. These factors galvanize our optimism for the future, despite the extended effects of the current pandemic. In the quarter, the business delivered revenue of $2.91 billion, reflecting 6.8% growth from the prior year. Adjusting for acquisition and divestiture activity and effectively taking into account of full quarters worth of COVID-19 impacts in specific areas within the business, organic revenue contracted by 3% over the same period. We recorded our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.55, up 34% from the prior year. In addition, we generated $422 million of cash from operations, ending the quarter with a solid cash balance of $588 million. Net bookings of $4.6 billion yielded a book-to-bill of 1.6 for the quarter, as well as a 1.6 on a trailing 12-month basis. These impressive business capture measurements do not yet reflect material contributions from several notable single award IDIQs that were competitively won over the past several months. Upon receipt, those task orders will be captured in our bookings metrics in subsequent quarters. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.8% was greater than the prior year. The primary factor was the net gain resulting from the VirnetX legal settlement for patent infringement, which was largely offset by a full quarter of the anticipated COVID-19 impacts we discussed during last quarter's earnings call. The impact of COVID-19 in the second quarter was approximately $222 million in revenue and $78 million in non-GAAP operating income. While some of the Q2 impacts will be recovered in the second half of 2020, we expect more of the recovery to push into 2021 as the pace of reopenings began both later and slower in the second quarter than previously estimated. Additionally, the security clearance processing timeline for new employees continues to lengthen and some programs such as Navy next gen remain affected by ongoing protest activity. In the meantime, due to the critical nature of our work, all of our Leidos facilities have remained open and each has implemented safe workforce plans to protect the health of our returning colleagues. For our guidelines, occupancy remains below 25% at this time, while more than half of our employee base continues to productively telework. Other than a small percentage that remain home in a ready state capacity, the remainder of our workforce reports to customer sites or other performance locations. From a subcontractor and supplier perspective, our business partner network remains resilient and in good health. We engage and monitor this important ecosystem daily. Lead times have improved during the course of the quarter and our teammates continue to perform across all of our programs. Equally important, during the second quarter, recruiting and talent acquisition remains strong as evidenced by a nearly 8% growth in new hires in compared to Q1. This metric excluded additions from M&A. Our ability to attract top talent in this manner is important as we staff up to successfully execute the new programs in our growing backlog, which now stands at a record $30.7 billion. This core competency will also prove critical as we prepare the business for continued growth given the ongoing high pace of business capture activities across the diverse markets we serve. When we compare mid-March through June of 2019 versus the same period in 2020, we found that we submitted more proposals during the pandemic with an aggregate approximate value of $8 billion. Now turning to several notable awards. Leidos was awarded the Traveler Processing and Vetting Software contract by the U.S Customs and Border Protection. Under this new blanket purchase agreement, we will provide a full range of software development lifecycle services to support CBP's mission to safeguard America's borders and enhance the nation's global economic competitiveness. This single award BPA has a 1-year base period of performance followed by four 1-year option periods and a total estimated value of $960 million. The company was also awarded the Enterprise Standard Architecture V also referred to as ESA V task order to provide managed IT services for the Department of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The single award hybrid task order has a one 10 months and two 1-year based periods of performance followed by six 1-year option periods. It includes a ceiling value not to exceed $850 million, if all options are exercised. Finally, our Dynetics subsidiary was awarded a sole-source contract for the production and sustainment of foreign radar simulators known as the Laboratory Intelligence Validated Emulator or LIVE family of products. The contract has a total estimated value of $356 million for production and sustainment for the next 10 years. On the M&A front, we remain focused on the successful integration of both Dynetics and the former L3Harris security detection and automation businesses, both are progressing on schedule. Since the Dynetics deal closed in late January, our integration has focused on combining our legacy Leidos Innovation Center, we call it the LInC, with our new Huntsville based business. The LInC has a great track record of executing early stage R&D for DARPA and the Air Force Research Lab and through the combination with Dynetics, we see opportunities for rapid prototyping and producing a higher conversion rate of research projects to programs of record. Other early collaborations led to important wins such as NASA's Human Lander Systems contract under the agency's Artemis program. If down selected, the follow on contract to place the first woman on the lunar surface and return man could exceed $4 billion. With security detection and automation, key business systems integration decisions have been made that further our confidence that the annual cost synergies of at least $20 million can be captured by 2022. Additionally, we are pleased with the expansion of our checkpoint solutions that will promote the safety and health of the traveling public and those entrusted to provide security services. To that end, in the quarter, we received an award at Edinburgh airport in Scotland to upgrade the airport's security tray return systems with antimicrobial tray technology. Also, the business was recently shortlisted for a 5-year opportunity at Munich Airport for the manufacturing, installation and service of explosive detection systems for cabin baggage. This work would represent an important step in our strategy to grow in the airport security solutions market. Turning now to the macro environment. Despite a likely continuing resolution in the fall, we expect minimal overall impacts to our business sector as the fiscal year 2021 budget levels are already set under the Bipartisan Budget agreement. Additionally, DoD has almost $125 billion in unobligated balances as of fiscal year 2019. Therefore, if budget authorities are flat, these balances can allow higher rates of outlay to address our customers' ongoing critical mission requirements. Looking through the Leidos lens, we are encouraged by our continued alignment with DoD's top 10 technology priorities. The ongoing execution of our long-term business strategy further mitigate potential future headwinds for our business as does our portfolio diversity as approximately half of our business is aligned with the federal, civil and health customers. With regard to our Health business, I'd like to reiterate that yesterday we announced the appointment of Liz Porter as the new Health Group President. Liz has held that position in an acting capacity since early March. Prior to this role, she served as the operation manager for the civil groups, Federal Energy and Environmental business. Liz's demonstrated leadership experience in program management, engineering and business development will continue to position Leidos for growth in the expanding health markets. Before I hand the call over to Jim, I want to acknowledge the pain over the continued injustice and violence suffered by the African American community. Over the past few months, we have seen this pain and more tragedy. We all saw the killing of George Floyd in May, and the tragedy in June as Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta was unnecessarily killed. I said this to our employees on our website and our social media platforms. And I want to say this again to you, racism and social injustice have no place in our society or at Leidos, nor does any form of discrimination. Equality and justice must be a universal experience and we must take action. And at Leidos, we are working to find new ways to engage on these critical topics in order for us to move forward together in unity. To start, we are partnering with the Equal Justice Initiative, who fights against racial injustice and poverty and promotes equal treatment in our criminal justice system for the most vulnerable. We have made a large donation in support of their important work, and I am moved by their focus on progress, education and equal justice under law. Also, we are implementing inclusion training across our company and working to launch a Leidos diversity and inclusion council. And we are hosting listening sessions with management for our employees across the enterprise. As CEO, I strongly embrace this responsibility and I want to share that with you today. I will now turn the call over to Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer for more details on our second quarter results and guidance. James Reagan : Thanks, Roger, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. As expected, Q2 has been a challenging quarter. However, our quarterly results reflect our team's agility to respond to the fluid environment. Let me start by sharing our quarterly results, an update on our recent financing activity, followed by an update to remaining year guidance, including COVID-19 impacts and assumptions. Second quarter revenues grew 6.8% over the prior year period and contracted 3% organically. The increase in top line revenue was driven by the recent acquisition of Dynetics and the L3Harris security detection and automation businesses. These increases were offset by approximately $132 million of COVID-19 related impacts. In addition, expected growth on existing programs was reduced by $91 million due to COVID-19. Without these pandemic driven headwinds, our second quarter organic growth would have been about 5% over the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 11.8% increased 180 basis points from the prior year quarter driven by the following items : the first was the $81 million net gain related to the VirnetX legal matter. The second was volume reductions on existing and new programs directly attributable to the COVID 19 pandemic of approximately $78 million. And after adjusting for these discrete items and the related revenue impact of $222 million, adjusted EBITDA margins would have been 10.9%, reflecting strong program performance and reduced indirect costs for our business. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter increased $0.39 over the prior year to a $1.55, driven by increased volume, strong program performance and lower share count. The net gain from the VirnetX legal matter and COVID-19 impacts largely offset one another. Operating cash flows of $422 million reflects a one-time VirnetX litigation payment of $85 million, the incremental accounts receivable monetization of $74 million and lower tax payments. As mentioned during our last earnings call, we remain committed to our long-term balanced capital deployment strategy. In the quarter, we completed two actions toward our path to an adjusted net leverage target of 3.0x. At the end of the quarter, the metrics stood at 3.4x. First, we've refinanced $1.75 billion of loans associated with the acquisition of Dynetics and the L3Harris security detection and automation businesses. The deal marked our strong return to the investment grade bond market as evidenced by an oversubscription of approximately 12x, which facilitated lower rates compared to the initial price indications and simplified our debt covenant structure. The transaction extended our debt maturities resulting in three tranches of senior unsecured notes, including a 3-year, a 5-year and a 10-year with a blended coupon rate of 3.75%.Second, we use the VirnetX proceeds of $81 million coupled with strong cash generation from operations during the quarter to pay down approximately $226 million of our debt. We had another solid quarter in business development, resulting in bookings of over $4.6 billion, bringing our book-to-bill for the quarter to 1.6x and overall backlog position of $30.7 billion. Large new business wins in the defense solutions segment and the Human Lander System program contributed to the record backlog number. Let me now take a moment to recognize the outstanding work by our business development and capture teams in submitting a world class winning proposal for the $7.7 billion Navy next gen competitive procurement. As you are aware, the award was protested and in June the U.S Government Accountability Office decisively denied two separate protests, including one from the incumbent. These decisions reaffirm the outstanding rating assigned to Leidos by the customer across the most critical technical and management evaluation factors, and also recognized our substantially lower price. We remain confident that we will prevail on the US Court of Federal Claims, and we look forward to ramping up the important work for our customer later this year. Until then the award will be excluded from our reported backlog. I'll speak more to the ongoing protest later when we discuss our updated FY '20 guidance. Before turning to our segment results, I'd like to provide an update on our hiring, given its importance to the growth of the company. I'm pleased to report that we welcomed approximately 1,000 employees from the security detection and automation businesses that we just acquired. And we also on-boarded nearly 2,000 additional new hires in the quarter.  Second quarter average weekly hiring has exceeded pre-pandemic levels, demonstrating our ability to attract top talent during a tight labor market. The year-to-date annualized voluntary attrition rate has declined by approximately 230 basis points compared to the prior year, and we continue to invest in our people to drive our attention and attract new employees. Now for an overview of our segment results. Defense Solutions revenue grew 12.6% on a year-over-year basis. The primary driver for the growth was the acquisition of Dynetics. From an organic perspective, the segment contracted 0.6% due to $18 million of contract volume reductions directly related to COVID-19. In addition, expected on contract growth was reduced by about $19 million due to COVID-19. Non-GAAP operating margins of 8.1% declined 20 basis points from the prior year quarter, primarily attributable to COVID-19 impacts, which were partially offset by program wins. Defense Solutions booked over a $3.5 billion of net awards, including two large new business wins with our intelligence customers, resulting at a book-to-bill of 2.0x in the quarter and 1.5x on a trailing 12-month basis. In our Civil segment, revenue grew 13.6% from the prior year quarter. This growth was primarily driven by the $80 million contribution from the acquisition of the L3Harris security detection and automation businesses, and increased contribution from new programs, partially offset by $18 million of reduced volumes on programs impacted by COVID-19. Furthermore, the pandemic caused a reduction of $34 million in expected growth on existing contracts and delays to the ramp up of new programs. On an organic basis, the segment grew 1.6% from the prior year. Non-GAAP operating margins in the Civil segment were strong at 12.9%, reflecting a 180 basis point increase over the prior year period. This increase was driven by the acquisition of the SD&A business, program write-ups and performance on new programs. Civil generated nearly $1 billion in net bookings in the quarter, reflecting the successful resolution of a protest on a new business award and the ESA V recompete award mentioned earlier. The result was a book-to-bill of 1.3x for the quarter and 2.1x on a trailing 12-month basis. And finally turning to our Health segment. Revenues were uncharacteristically low, declining 20.4% from the prior year period due to $96 million of COVID-19 impacts and the sale of the Health Staff Augmentation business in the third quarter of 2019. In addition, expected program growth reflected in our previous guidance was lower by $38 million due to COVID-19. These negative impacts were partially offset by contributions from new programs and the acquisition of IMX in the third quarter of 2019. After adjusting for the COVID-19 impacts and the acquisition and divestiture activity, revenues would have increased 11% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margins for the Health segment were 5.3% for the quarter. This lower than normal margin was the result of COVID-19 driven volume reductions on certain managed service contracts with fixed cost infrastructures. Our Health segment saw approximately $150 million of bookings in the quarter, driving a book-to-bill of 0.4x with a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 0.9x. Moving now to the remainder of the year. We're updating our guidance across all metrics to account for our second quarter results, additional COVID-19 impacts and increased visibility for the second half of the year. We're adjusting our revenue guidance to a range of $12.2 billion to $12.6 billion, which is a reduction of $300 million or 2.4% from the prior range midpoint and represents a 12% increase over 2019 results. This $300 million reduction includes additional COVID-19 impacts, which reflect the slower than anticipated customer reopenings, the delayed ramp up of the Navy next gen contract and various other program delays and volume changes. As the NGEN protest has moved from the GAO, where it was fully decided to the Court of Federal Claims, we remain confident that this protest will be resolved in our favor. However, this does delay the full transition until late in the fourth quarter, continuing into 2021. Note that in our previous guidance, we expected our COVID impacted programs to begin to ramp up back to normalized run rates during the second quarter. However, with slower customer openings, we now expect programs to return to their normalized run rates in the fourth quarter, and then continue unimpacted into 2021. We anticipate that the majority of the 2020 impacts will be recovered in 2021, reinforcing our confidence in the ability to grow more than 10% organically next year with margins at or above 10 -- our 10% adjusted EBITDA margin target. In terms of margins, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins of 10.0% to 10.2% for the year. This 20% -- excuse me, this 20 basis point increase at the midpoint from the prior range reflects the net gain from the VirnetX litigation and the reduced indirect rates, partially offset by the impact of lower margins within the year in our Health segment. As a result of these new ranges for revenue and margins, we were updating our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance range to $5.25 to $5.55. This increase of $0.25 at the midpoint from the prior guide reflects the net gain received from the VirnetX litigation, a slightly lower tax rate and reduced interest expense for the year offset by the COVID-19 impacts discussed earlier. Finally, we expect cash from operations to be at least $1.2 billion for the year, up from the prior guide of $1.0 billion, reflecting the proceeds from the VirnetX litigation and an anticipated $100 million increase in the net receipts from the accounts receivable monetization facility. The two additional items to note to help you with modeling. We expect lower net interest expense for the full year of $176 million, a decrease that reflects lower interest rates to our debt restructuring and a slightly lower non-GAAP tax rate in the range of 21% to 22%. With all that, I'll turn it over to Rob, so we can take some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Robert Spingarn : Hi, good morning. Roger Krone : Hey, good morning, Rob. Robert Spingarn : Just on the back of what Jim just went through and Roger, you talked about this, so I just want to be clear on the pressure, particularly in the Health segment. Are you saying that's mostly timing driven and that you're going to recover a lot of that next year or \u2026? Roger Krone : Yes. Yes, it has to do with some of the medical exam work that we do, think about it as fixed infrastructure and because of COVID, a lot of facilities were shut down and we have moved some of that to telehealth and some of that through review of existing medical records, but the vast majority of the work that we do requires a medical exam. And those are medical exams that have to be done, whether it be workman's comp or a disability benefit. And those have rolled, if you will, into backlog. So you'll think of it as a simple inventory, those need to get done and they're not getting done. And the individuals who need that benefit need a medical exam. And so if they didn't get it in second quarter, then they're in the backlog now for third quarter and fourth quarter, but it's just going to take time to work through the backlog. So it is literally a timing and what we have seen in the past, Rob, when we have seen the backlog, we will surge right, and conduct more exams than normal to catch up. So this is not a permanent timing difference. It literally is just a delay and then we will surge and then sometime probably late in '21, we'll come back to normal. Robert Spingarn : I see. And it's not that they can get the exam elsewhere or that it's somehow lost share or anything like that? It's \u2026 Roger Krone : No. Robert Spingarn : \u2026 they come back to you. Roger Krone : And of the offers of these exams, whether it'd be workman's comp or a disability are in the same boat. We've all been shut down and the backlog has unfortunately grown and we're now 85% open, something like that as of earlier this week. And so it's just going to take time now to work through the backlog and we're committed to go do that. Robert Spingarn : Okay. And then the other thing I wanted to talk about, I think it's very interesting, but your role on Skyborg as the system design agent. And wanted to see if you could talk about the scope, perhaps of that contract. And if the work scope there is kind of a won and done, or if you have any kind of recurring revenue stream from Skyborg long-term? Roger Krone : Well, we are the -- essentially the systems engineering contractor for the customer. And as you know, I think you may have written is that there are a handful of other companies that are working on the concept and the vehicle, and our job on that program is to assist the customer in doing technical assessments and systems engineering at the concept level. And it's a nice program for us. We're obviously very, very pleased with it. It is not our largest program and probably won't grow to be because of our systems engineering role. We stand more along with the customer and the user than we do with the companies who may be designing and building the vehicle. Robert Spingarn : But that makes you somewhat agnostic on how this plays out. Your role \u2026 Roger Krone : Absolutely. Robert Spingarn : \u2026 is there. And does this help you with autonomy efforts down the line? Roger Krone : Well, I think it helps us in many areas with autonomy with systems engineering. It advances, if you will, our past performance and our qualifications in the area. And when we assessed it, we viewed -- we didn't really have an airborne offering and a better position for us was to be in the systems engineering role with the customer. So it's a great qualification for us. Robert Spingarn : Right. Thank you very much. Roger Krone : You\u2019re welcome. Good morning. Operator : The next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Hi, good morning, Roger, Jim, Peter. Roger Krone : Hey, good morning. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Roger, I guess, related to Rob's question to a degree, there's an element of lighthouse with the thesis changing as the organic leader in the growth space, given your recent wins like NGEN. However, obviously during COVID, I thought you gave a great explanation in May about the impacts of COVID, whether it was DHMSM and Antarctica. But clearly that the scope of the COVID impact extended beyond those programs. So I guess, why do you think those businesses were impacted? And you touched upon it a little bit just now, but -- and how do you think that normalizes and how do we think about, I guess my follow-on is how do we think about 2021? Because you say in the slides, you normalize in Q4, whether it's revenue growth and margin mix. Roger Krone : Yes. I will get started and I will let Jim finish. If I were -- the Defense Health program, the electronic records program for DHA is only impacted to very, very slight. In fact, we would reiterate that the completion schedule is still on track in the '23 timeframe. So most of our digital transformation work in the healthcare business is pretty close to on schedule. So we haven't seen huge numbers there. Really the impact this quarter has been in the exam business that we have, and it really cautious to take a couple months where we just couldn't get the exams done. And maybe I'll let Jim expand on that a little bit, sort of our fixed cost, variable cost view of our examination business. James Reagan : Yes, Sheila, I think Roger said it well, but to just emphasize the point on what's changed from when we talked about the expected impacts a quarter ago, the real change has been that the impact of the pandemic in a number of geographies has been more prolonged and perhaps more severe than we had visibility to 90 days ago. And that has caused some of our customer sites and some of our examination sites to be closed longer than expected, and they returned to work in some of our customer sites, whether it's our intelligence customers within the Defense Solution segment or the places where we serve patients for these medical exam services, all of those have had a longer and more prolonged return to opening than we expected just three months ago. Roger Krone : Sheila, your comment about '21, I think was right on. We expect to come back to a normative level in the fourth quarter and then therefore exceed that level in the exam business in 2021. So, obviously, optimistic about what '21 will look like. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Great. Thank you. Roger Krone : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Could you please give us a little insight into recovery under the CARES Act, for example, the areas in which you expect recovery is that medical exam? And do you have any hope, and is it in your bookings that you would get recovery of these? James Reagan : Yes. Cai, I'll start in. If Roger has more to say he'll pile on. The CARES Act impact is actually helping us keep a number of employees in the Defense Solution segment, primarily in the Intelligence Agency customer set in a ready state. And so we're able to recover full costs, but not fee for those people. And it's no more than 5% of our employee base. The CARES Act does not cover the recovery of ready state employees or facilities for the contracts that we have in our health solutions business for two reasons. One, a number -- a certain amount of that revenue is from commercial customers. So think about insurance companies who -- for whom we're doing disability exams and so forth, but also our government customers, because these are done on a fixed unit price basis where we do have some significant fixed infrastructure, think about lease costs and the cost of staff to process these exams. Those costs are not normally covered by the provisions of the CARES Act. So that -- that's the primary impact that you're hearing us talk about in the Health business. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan Chase. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much. I was just curious with regard to the 300 of incremental impact. Should we think of that as being the vast majority of that in the Health business, and I guess on the -- in the defense side, kind of thought of the main challenge for COVID-19 for federal service providers as being facilities that aren\u2019t open. And so, how should we think about the incremental impact that divided between those two -- those two areas? Roger Krone : Seth, I think about roughly half of the 300 as being incremental impact from COVID-19 with a little under half of it being the delay of the engine ramp up, because of the ongoing protest activity there. And then the balance of it would be COVID-19 impacts in other parts of the business such as the Civil business and other parts of the Defense Solutions segment. Seth Seifman : Okay. It sounds like then you don't really see that on the intelligence side and the impact of the pandemic on secure facilities. It sounds like that you don't see very much incremental impact there. Roger Krone : Not that much incremental. The bulk of the incremental impact is being seen -- the largest single piece of it is being seen in the Health business. Seth Seifman : Okay, great. Thanks. Thanks very much. Roger Krone : Okay. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Roger Krone : Good morning, Jon. James Reagan : Hi, Jon. Jon Raviv : Hey, thank you very much for that. Sorry about that. Just, Jim, some of those cash moving pieces heading from this year into next year, I think you've got some sort of almost one-time transient items helping you get to the 1.2 or greater this year. Can you just help us think about what the moving pieces are going forward? Some of those tax items, perhaps that go back, how sustainable the AR factory is, et cetera, et cetera. Thank you. James Reagan : Sure. Well, first of all, we expect to leave the AR monetization program in place and that can -- there is some more possibility there to the extent that we need additional funding from it. It's a very low cost mechanism for us to use and it's ready for us any time. And the other moving parts in getting us from the $1 billion to the $1.2 billion number on the change in guidance, there's -- as we mentioned earlier, the VirnetX impact that's cash in the bank today. And then there are also some positive impacts from the CARES Act on how we pay taxes. So we've been able to defer the payment of both income and payroll taxes, primarily payroll taxes into next year. The portion of the deferral of our income taxes is simply moving it into Q3, Q4. So think of the tax benefits into next year as being over a $100 million, and then the balance of the changes are primarily driven by COVID-19 impacts being an offset to the tailwinds that we're seeing on cash flow. Jon Raviv : Understood. So should we be prepared for operating cash flow to fall year-on-year in 2021, or if -- to the extent of the CARES Act items are offset by COVID, we can actually grow off that $1.2 billion in '21? James Reagan : Well, some of that -- some of the tax benefits will be offset next year and into 2022. But the only other headwinds that I think we can anticipate from a cash flow perspective is that we expect the business to grow nicely into 2021. In the past we've said high single digits, but now that we've got some significant backlog from the Health business and other parts of the Defense Solutions business for work that's going to carry into 2021. That's how we get to some confidence around 10% or better in terms of our top line next year. Jon Raviv : Thank you. James Reagan : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Peter Arment : Yes. Good morning, Roger, Jim, Peter. Roger Krone : Hi, Peter. James Reagan : Good morning, Peter. Peter Arment : Hey, Roger, just -- maybe just without getting into maybe specific dollar numbers, but when we think about the security detection and automation kind of revenue profile, now that you've kind of been deeper into this business and seeing the impacts of COVID or seen -- had conversations with customers. How do we think about this business as we go into '21? Is it a business that's growing or maybe just give us some color around the health of business? Roger Krone : Well, I -- I'd love to. By the way, they are ahead of our plan. So we had an internal plan that we put together for the combined business, which included the Tewkesbury business and the business in the U.K that makes the trade return systems. And they had a quarter that exceeded our expectations and we expect that to continue. And I know in the last call, we talked about what's going on at airports and is this going to have sort of a quieting effect on that business. And our speculation was that airports are going to use this period of time to do capital improvements. And we've certainly seen that. We've also seen airports wanting to add social distancing and health and safety to the screening and the checkpoint. If you have to stand 6 feet apart, you've got to redesign the checkpoint, which means you might need more lanes, you're certainly going to need places for people to stand the antimicrobial trays, putting ultraviolet light in the return pan for trays, doing touchless screening and looking at people's IDs. There's just a lot of opportunity to grow the business beyond what we had anticipated when we built our original business case last year to acquire the business. So then the team their led by Maria Hedden has been doing a great job of reaching out globally to customers, and we're in 150 or more countries now. And really across the board, we've seen a lot of interest in capital improvements. We would tell you that rebound is probably started a little stronger outside the United States. We're still sort of dealing with this kind of resurgence this summer, but in many of our foreign markets they have had stricter lockdown on the pandemic and therefore their numbers are smaller and they are implementing biometric concepts at their airport. So we're very, very pleased and the integration is going well. And it is, like I said, ahead of our business case. Peter Arment : Appreciate the color. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Edward Caso : Hi. Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about your recompete exposure for the rest of this year, as well as 2021, please? Thanks. Roger Krone : Yes. Thanks, Ed. They're kind of three that we talk about. We've got our -- or what we call our NASA NEST program, which has been submitted. And then we've got two more that have not been submitted. We've got one at NGA, we call our user-facing and data services contract. It's probably the largest that's up for recompete. It's about $4.4 billion. We should submit that towards the end of the summer. And then we\u2019ve the IT services work that we do for the Army Corps. We refer to as ACE-IT. That's a proposal that ought to submit also at the end of the summer and it's going to be at $1 billion plus. But the only one that's actually been submitted is our FAA/NISC, which is the National Aerospace Systems Integration Support Contract, where we are the incumbent. We're actually the incumbent on all three of those. Edward Caso : And is 2021 a normal 20%, 25% year or is there anything unusual there? Roger Krone : Yes, very normal. And no -- there is not a Hanford out there. Edward Caso : Okay. And you mentioned, you were seeing issues in clearances. We hadn't really been hearing that from some of your competitors. Is there anything unique about the mix of your business that's challenging you more? Roger Krone : Well, I think what may be unique for us by the way, it's primarily in our intel business. So, it's the very high-end clearances often requiring a polygraph. I think the background investigation seem to be going okay. I think the problem is, I don't want to get in too much detail but if you've ever been through a polygraph, you know it is a very COVID unfriendly process in how that's conducted. And the throughput that the agencies have on getting polygraphs done has slowed down. So it's uniquely in our intel business. And I think, why it affects us maybe more than others is because of the wind and the growth that we've had. So we're not trying to maintain staff. We are actually trying to significantly increase the staff in our intel business because of our wins. And that means, we have to get new people through the clearance process and able to support our growth. And not reflecting on some of the others that have reported. Our clearance process is not about our current workforce or really predominantly and what we call our collateral clearance, which you might see in our Defense group like a secret or a top secret, it really is in that high end group. Edward Caso : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi : Yes. Good morning. Roger Krone : Hi, Joe. James Reagan : Hi, Joe. Good morning. Joseph DeNardi : Hey, guys. Jim, just in terms of 2021, is the thinking maybe that half of the growth is NGEN and half is all else, just in the context of you are sitting on a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.6x ex NGEN, which would speak to really strong maybe double-digit growth by itself? So why can't growth be better than 10%, or do you see kind of a multi-year period beyond 2021 with really strong growth given the backlog? And can you just update us on the pipeline of bids that you're expecting? Thank you. James Reagan : Sure. Well, first of all, Joe, thanks for the question. The -- if you're speaking first with the pipeline. The pipeline of new business opportunities continues to grow. And interestingly, it is growing with a lot of programs where the -- first of all, there -- we still have plenty of $1 billion size programs in the pipeline, but there is also continuing growth in the size programs that are in the hundreds of millions of dollars. So, it gives us greater diversity and greater opportunity. To your question about where the -- is half of the growth coming from NGEN? The answer is really no, because the NGEN program will take some time during 2021 to ramp up. And so, the growth of the business -- your point is well taken that it could be better than 10%. But it's our habit to be pretty careful and conservative in putting out those kind of targets this early in the cycle. Last point that I would make is that, we -- as we get to the back end of COVID, and our customers are more comfortable with the protocols that we're putting in place to protect patients and people undergoing these exams, we expect that we will be back on the path to the health groups prior stature as being the -- the part of our business that has the highest margins and the highest growth rates. And while the Defense Solutions segment is going to enjoy a nice growth from the NGEN program, we are looking forward to seeing the health group get back to healthy margins and healthy growth rates in 2021. Joseph DeNardi : Yes. That's helpful. And then just along those lines, in terms of the expectation that the business kind of gets back to normal by 4Q. Do you have visibility into that or is that more kind of hopeful in nature at this point? I understand things are fluid, are you having customer conversations that give you confidence around that, or are you able to kind of change certain processes that lessens your exposure to kind of what you've been facing the past few months? Thanks for the time. Roger Krone : It's more of the latter. We already sit today in a better position where both the commercial and the government customers have allowed us to reopen clinics. We have put social distancing, noncontact in place, people are coming back to the clinics. We are seeing the volume increasing. It just didn't increase in the second quarter and because we're now using PPE, we are having people wait in the parking lot before they come in for an exam, we're not at the same number of exams per day as we were pre-COVID. And so, that's going to take another quarter or so to ramp back to where our capacity is, where it was pre-COVID on a clinic-by-clinic basis. We're -- as I said, I think we're about 85% on the clinics that are open, we expect it to be fully open in this quarter. And then we've got to get our capacity up and we would only work so much overtime to get the number of exams done per day. And we are all learning how to be more efficient in this COVID-19 environment. And clearly, post vaccine we will be either back or better than we were pre, because we are learning how to be more efficient and how to do some exams by telehealth, which we -- was not a big part of our business prior. And that allows us to do -- to have more capacity through a given site. So -- and the customers across the board, corporations, government agencies are all very eager to work with us because the backlog is not good, it's not good for them. We want to go ahead and get these exams done, so we can get the claims adjudicated, and we can get reimbursements to the individuals. James Reagan : Hey, Joe, one other point, aside from the Health business, in the Defense Solutions segment and in particular, our Intelligence Agency customers, they've seen very real mission impacts, because of the need to partially close their work locations and they are eager to work with us to get people back in those work locations, and that is a process that's currently underway. Last point that I would make is, and one of the things that we've learned from how we've had to operate, we've reduced our cost structure. And when you take the VirnetX settlement and when you take out the COVID-19 impacts to the business that are arguably temporary, the business had a 10.9% EBITDA margin in the quarter, and while EBITDA margins go up and down from quarter-to-quarter, we do feel confident that on an ongoing basis, what this has done is we've leaned out the business even further than we have and -- which gives us strong visibility into good margins into 2021 and beyond. Joseph DeNardi : Very helpful. Thank you. James Reagan : Thank you, Joe. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Matt Akers with Barclays. Matt Akers : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Roger Krone : Hey. Good morning. Matt Akers : I wonder if you could comment -- good morning. I wonder if you could comment just on what you're seeing kind of early Q3 is typically the big order quarter for the year. I mean, are there any signs that this will be any slower than prior years or are things sort of -- customer demand sort of holding up? Roger Krone : There is really no reason why it should be different than any other prior year. I would simply point out, frankly, because of our success and the wins, we are also very successful in attracting protests and adjudication in the Court of Federal Claims and that has somewhat spread our 3Q. We've got a couple of programs that have been in protest. They come out of protests, they get corrective action. We have to resubmit. And I think it -- where we might have seen a lot more concentration exactly in 3Q. We've seen some of that spread a bit. We think next gen probably oral arguments are in October, that won't get resolved probably for a month after that. We have a program we call the Reserve Health Readiness Program, which is a large program to provide services to the military reserve and that is in corrective action. So we\u2019ve to go through a resubmit, which we have done and then they have to adjudicate and make an award. Again, that could be third quarter, but it's always hard to predict what happens in the protest world. But there is nothing unusual about this year that says, third quarter should be any different than our prior year quarters. Matt Akers : Got it. That's helpful. And then, I guess, one more, just on tax. So it's -- I guess, R&D going from expensing to amortizing over multiple years, I think in 2022. Can you give kind of what the impact of that could be on Leidos? James Reagan : Yes. The -- we are actually looking at ways that even with the change in the law, we are going to be able to recognize more of the work we do as eligible for the R&D tax credit. I don't have a precise number for you, but we are not viewing it as something that's going to have a big impact or material impact on our effective tax rate. This year, we've done a really good job of identifying things that are eligible for, not just the R&D tax credit, but in -- even more importantly, in connection with the acquisitions that we've done, being able to take part of the ascribed value of the business and make them tangible personal property that is eligible under the accelerated depreciation rules that came with the recent Tax Reform Act. So we think that there's some opportunity there to improve the cash tax position, not just from how we can optimize R&D, but even more importantly, get more benefit from the acquired companies. Matt Akers : Got it. All right. Thank you. James Reagan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call back to Peter Berl for closing remarks. Peter Berl : Great. Thank you, Rob. Thank you all for your time this morning and for your interest in Leidos. We look forward to updating you again soon. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the floor over to Peter Berl with Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Peter Berl : Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of the Leidos management team. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter ending October 2nd, 2020. Roger will lead off the call with notable highlights from the quarter as well as comments on the market environment and our Company's strategy. Jim will follow with a discussion of our financial performance and our guidance expectations. After these remarks from Roger and Jim, we\u2019ll open the call for your questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific Risk Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, during the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in the press release that we issued this morning and is also available in the presentation slides. The press release and presentation as well as supplementary financial information file are provided on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.leidos.com. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Roger Krone. Roger Krone : Thank you. Peter, and thank you all for joining us this morning for our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. As near the end of a challenging year from both an individual and community perspective, I sincerely hope that each of you and your loved ones remain safe and healthy. Leidos third quarter results reflect our hard work and dedication of our employees and close collaboration with our customers, as we provided continuity of operations, while accelerating our pandemic response plans. This is evidenced by record revenue, solid margins, record backlog and record operational cash generation. While challenges still remain, we're pleased with the growth and margin trajectory as we enter the fourth quarter and beyond. In the quarter, the business delivered revenue of $3.24 billion, a new high watermark for the corporation, reflecting 14.4% growth from the prior year. Adjusting for acquisitions and divestiture activity, organic revenue grew by almost 2%, demonstrating the declining effects of COVID-19, as our teams diligently executed their recovery plans. We recorded non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share of $1.47, up 8% from the prior year. In addition, the business generated a record $592 million of cash from operations. Net bookings of $4.3 billion in the quarter yielded a book-to-bill of 1.3 times, as well as 1.5 times on a trailing 12 month basis, despite several bid protests at the end of the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 10.7% reflect strong program execution across all business segments, including an accelerated reopening of our medical exam business, as we designed workflow protocols and safety measures that met customer requirements. While the impact of maintaining our fixed cost exam infrastructure was deeply felt in Q2, that investment was the right decision, as the market demand for our services rebounded well in the third quarter, as demonstrated by our results. For the quarter, COVID-19 impacts to the overall business were approximately $109 million in revenue, and $23 million in operating income, representing a significant decline from the prior quarters impact of $223 million and $78 million respectively. Furthermore, third quarter impacts were partially offset by program performance and on contact growth across our highly diversified portfolio. We continue to expect recovery of greater than 70% of COVID-19 impacts in future quarters. Now turning to some notable awards that contributed to our ninth consecutive quarter of record backlog. In the Defense Solution segment, Leidos was awarded a $306 million follow-on contract by the Army Contracting Command to provide the full spectrum of turnkey ground and flight operations for the Saturn Arch aircraft in OCONUS contingency environments. In the civil segment, we won a $292 million prime contract by the Federal Aviation Administration to design and develop a system to provide real-time access to essential weather, aeronautical and National Airspace System, NAS information through a common NAS-wide Enterprise, Information Display System. Additionally, within the intelligence community, the company was awarded contracts collectively valued at $445 million, which encompass mission-critical services that help to counter global threats and strengthen national security, $31.7 billion backlog about 2.5 times our third quarter annualized revenue run rate, coupled with our strong new business pipeline, provides a strong foundation for accelerated growth into next year and beyond. Furthermore, our backlog does not reflect recent awards with the Defense Health Agency and the Army Special Operations Command due to protest activity at the close of the quarter. Similarly, the $8 billion Navy NextGen protest remains in the US Court of Federal Claims with oral arguments now scheduled for November 13. We still anticipate a favorable outcome shortly thereafter. Now turning to the macro environment. The US government is currently operating under a continuing resolution through December 11, which includes an extension of Section 3610 of the CARES Act. It is likely that the CR is extended into the next calendar year, we do not anticipate any material impacts to our 2020 year end results. Furthermore, we remain engaged with our industry partners to help ensure that extension of the CR also includes the existing Section 3610 language. Looking to 2021 and beyond, we continue to have conviction that our positioning in infrastructure, space exploration and healthcare in the federal civil markets and in unmanned systems, hypersonics and digital modernization, in the defense and Intel markets closely aligns with our customers enduring needs, which are supported by both sides of the aisle within the federal government. Next, I want to update you on the Leidos Relief Foundation, which has been a tremendous resource for so many members of our Leidos family who have been affected by the pandemic. The foundation is generously funded by hundreds of fellow employees, as well as members of the Leidos executive leadership team and Board of Directors. To date, funds from the foundation have already been directed to assist 175 employees or employee families who have experienced a financial hardship or lost a loved one during these challenging times. The health and well being of our employees is our top priority. And I'm proud to be part of a team that continually supports one another. I want to mention one other important development to you today. On October 20th, we announced the departure of a valued colleague from our Board of Directors, Lawrence C. Nussdorf. Larry stepped down from the company's Board of Directors for medical reasons, effective October 15. Larry has dedicated more than a decade of service and leadership to our company, seeing us through transformational change growth and helping create enviable shareholder value. He has accelerated our strategies and added value at every turn. Recognizing that Larry is irreplaceable, our Board decided to eliminate the vacancy caused by his departure and we will carry on with 12 Directors. To say that we will miss Larry is an understatement, as his expertise and all aspects of financial investment and legal activities gave us a sounding board we could always rely on. I am personally thankful for his friendship and counsel. At times he has challenged me and I have grown because of it. I am incredibly appreciative of his mentorship and friendship. And I didn't want to close today without acknowledging his many contributions. We wish Larry and his family well as he focuses on his recovery. I will now turn the call over to Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer for more details on our third quarter results and guidance. James Reagan : Thanks, Roger, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. In the interest of getting to your questions, I'll focus my comments on our solid third quarter results and full year guidance. Third quarter revenue was strong, growing 14% over the prior year period including 1.7% organically. In addition to contributions from recent acquisitions, our growth was primarily fueled by recent program wins and on-contract growth, plus our ability to accelerate the reopening of medical exam clinics, which is a part of our business with high operating leverage. Today, we are performing in volumes that exceed pre-pandemic levels to address the backlog of medical exams that had built up during the second quarter. These increases were partially offset by $109 million of COVID-19 impacts, comprised of approximately $40 million of year-over-year impacts, plus $69 million of anticipated growth that we would have achieved on existing and new programs. Adjusting for the impact of COVID-19 on the quarter, organic revenue growth would have been roughly 5.5%. Adjusted EBITDA margins were also strong at 10.7%, consistent with the prior year period, in spite of a $23 million COVID-19 headwind to expect to growth. This compares well with our prior year adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.7%, which had been assisted by the $54 million Greek arbitration award. Our robust margins this quarter were driven by exceptional program execution, and indirect cost management across all of our segments. Non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.47 exceeded our expectations, growing $0.11 over the prior year period. Our strong program performance and increased volume on existing and new programs partially offset by higher interest expense drove the 8% growth year-over-year. Record high operating cash flows of $592 million for the quarter were driven by strong operational performance across the enterprise, higher customer advanced payments and favorable timing of vendor disbursements. The AR monetization facility contributed only $7 million during the quarter. Keeping with our disciplined capital deployment strategy and our commitment to deliver, this quarter we used cash on hand to pay down $477 million of debt, retiring a $450 million senior unsecured note three months early. Additionally, in October, we completed a $1 billion bond deal that benefited us in three ways. First, enabled by our investment grade credit rating, we were able to capitalize on favorable market conditions by securing lower long-term interest rates. Second, we replaced certain debt instruments with ones with extended maturities. And lastly, the deal provided our balance sheet with greater near term liquidity that allows us to take advantage of smaller tuck-in acquisition opportunities, where speed of execution provides us with an advantage. As of the end of the quarter, our adjusted net leverage was slightly above 3.0, which was a goal we had previously set for early 2021 after we completed the two acquisitions earlier this year. Having reached our target leverage, we remain committed to our long-term balanced capital deployment strategy, which consists of being appropriately levered and maintaining our investment grade rating, returning a quarterly dividends to our shareholders and reinvesting for growth both organically and inorganically and returning excess cash to shareholders in a tax efficient manner. Bookings of $4.3 billion were strong across all segments and resulted in a 1.3 times consolidated book-to-bill with record backlog ending the quarter at $31.7 billion. This record backlog reflects a 33% increase over the prior year period. It's also worth noting, that excluded from our book-to-bill and our backlog is the impact of $9 billion of contract awards that are currently under protest. Now for an overview of our segment results. Defense Solutions revenue increased 22% over the prior year and 3.5% organically. Driving this growth was the Dynetics acquisition and the strong execution of new programs, partially offset by COVID-19 impacts of $26 million from reduced volumes on legacy programs and $14 million from expected growth. Non-GAAP operating margins in the Defense Solution segment of 8.8% grew 110 basis points from the prior year quarter. Contributing to the increase was the Dynetics acquisition, new program wins and reduced indirect spending, partially offset by impacts due to COVID-19, including the effects of maintaining mission-essential personnel in a ready state for key customers. Defense Solutions booked over $1.8 billion in net awards, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.9 X for the quarter and 1.2 on a trailing 12 month basis. In our Civil segment, revenue grew 5.2% over the prior year period, and contracted 4.9% organically. The top line growth was driven by the acquisition of the security detection and automation businesses. This increase was offset by COVID-19 impacts consisting of $14 million from reduced program volumes and $38 million from expected growth on existing and new programs. Several non-GAAP operating margins of 10.5% increased 220 basis points over the prior year quarter. The primary drivers were increased volumes on mature programs, and a decrease in bad debt expense that reduced the prior year\u2019s third quarter results. Civil recorded nearly $1 billion in net bookings for the quarter, resulting in a 1.3 time book-to-bill and 2.4 on a trailing 12 month basis. And finally, turning to our Health segment. Health segment revenues increased 2.4% over the prior year quarter and 30% sequentially. Additionally, after adjusting for acquisition and divestiture activity, health revenues grew 5.8% organically. This growth was directly attributable to the hard work accomplished by our team to both reopen and ramp the medical exam business back to pre-COVID levels faster than previously forecasted. Health segment non-GAAP operating margins were strong at 16.3%, an increase of 150 basis points over the prior year quarter, reflecting the accelerated recovery in our medical exam business, the divestiture of the health staff augmentation business in the third quarter of 2019 and reduction in business investments. The Health segment booked over $1.5 billion in net awards, driven by an increase to backlog in the medical exam business based on sustained elevated case deliveries and demand. This 13% growth over the prior year period resulted in a 3.0 book-to-bill for the quarter and a 1.0 on a trailing 12 month basis. Moving now to the remainder of the year. With the strength of our Q3 results, we are revising our 2020 guidance as follows. We expect revenue for the year to be between $12.3 billion and $12. 5 billion reaffirming the prior midpoint and tightening the range. This update reflects the execution of our strategy outlined in the second quarter earnings call and returning to normalized run rates and business mix in the fourth quarter. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins for the year between 10.6% and 10.8%, a 60 basis point increase at the midpoint from the previous guidance. This reflects the improved margins in the third quarter from high staff utilization, reduced indirect costs and strong program execution across the entire business. We now expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $5.65 to $58.5, an increase of $0.35 at the midpoint of the prior guide. Finally, we expect cash from operations to be at least $1.2 billion consistent with the prior guide. However, due to the strong cash flow generated, on a year-to-date basis, coupled with the additional liquidity stemming from the October bond deal, we no longer anticipate any full year contribution from our existing AR monetization facility, whereas the prior guidance had assumed $300 million. As we look to the coming year, the accelerated recovery we have seen during the third quarter, along with our strong level of contract awards this year gives us increased confidence that we will have a strong 2021. Assuming continued success in defending the awards that are in protest and our customers continued ability to adapt to the pandemic, we could achieve organic revenue growth in 2021 of at least 10% to 12% and adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 10.3% or better, as is our normal business practice, formal 2021 guidance will be discussed at our fourth earnings conference call. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob, so we can take some questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question today comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions. Joseph DeNardi : Thanks. Good morning. Roger Krone : Good morning, Joe. Joseph DeNardi : Yeah, good morning. Jim, can you maybe just provide some of the puts and takes that go into the margin commentary for next year that you just talked about? Maybe what are some of the headwinds, how much of that is tied to COVID versus newer opportunities ramping up? Thank you. James Reagan : Sure. For next year, Joe, we don't see significant headwind related to COVID. And you know, as we've said in the call, we are really finding ourselves within - with a reduction in run rate in indirect expenses, strong program execution. And in terms of how we're thinking about next year, I want to make sure I reiterate the fact that this is really preliminary. And it's based on where we see the numbers penciling out for next year, we're right in the middle of our planning process. And you know, right now, we're seeing some ability to sustain the strength and margins that we're seeing in the third quarter. The only real headwinds that are worth pointing out right now that we have to be cognizant of is, that we have a couple of very large new programs ramping in the coming year. And as we've said before, typically margins on those programs can be as low as low single digits. We think of our entire company, as a portfolio of programs. And, while there are a number of programs that have margins that continue to increase, that we do have a couple of big programs where we have early stage margin pressure that typically starts to resolve itself after the first couple of years of these long-term programs. And that's really what that reflects. We feel like, given the portfolio that we have, we're definitely going to be seeing strengthening margins into next year. Joseph DeNardi : Okay. That's helpful. And then Roger, I wondered if could just talk about kind of the overall award environment, book-to-bill was maybe a little seasonally light, that you're not alone, some of your peers have reported similar. But did you see any kind of slowdown in the quarter? Or do you see pent-up demand over the next few quarters? Thank you. Roger Krone : Maybe a little, we have a program with the FAA, that we say it's going to award any week, and then we don't know which week. I think our book-to-bill was probably impacted more by protests. One of those program was \u2013 is was the second protest. And we had sort of hoped that we had answered all the issues from the first protest. And we're optimistic that we would have booked that in the quarter, and it turned out that, that didn't happen. Then maybe NextGen got delayed about another two weeks. So I just - there's always some delays to the ride, you know, even in good times before COVID. Within a given month, it's a little bit unpredictable. And with the government's fiscal year, there was stuff that was trying to get out within the quarter and it slid. We think we'll pick most of that up in fourth quarter. And we haven't seen from the customer activity, like an effect from, I don\u2019t know whether we call ourselves in a second wave or third wave or whatever you want to call, where we are now. But it certainly - you know, I don't see things accelerating, but I think they're kind of going at the usual pace. So for us, really the 1.3 really is a protest story. Thanks, Joe. Joseph DeNardi : Thank you. Operator : The question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Seth Seifman : Hey, thanks very much and good morning. Roger Krone : Good morning, Seth. Seth Seifman : Good morning. In that outlook for next year, in terms of how you think about the duration of a continuing resolution and at what point it starts to you know, have an impact, given that we could have an extended one following the election? Roger Krone : Yeah, our base assumption is that we get a another CR on 11th of December, it includes 3610. And frankly, it probably goes to March. We get through whatever happens tomorrow. And that's - its effect on January. And, you know, it's either the current administration and they have a lot of vacancies they want to fill, or it's a new administration, they've got vacancies, I think our assumption is you're going to see other way, all the way through that until they fill out their leadership team. And so it could be March, it could be even beyond that. And there is precedence for this. We've seen it before. So it's fully baked into our thoughts about the future. And that means you will be halfway through the government fiscal year before you actually get a bill. But again, we've all been doing this a long time, we've seen it before. And frankly, there may even be an advantages, because if we get a CR, then everybody holds on to the budgets that they had last year, and you don't see a lot of reprioritization amongst different programs at different agencies. So no I don't see much impact. Seth Seifman : Okay. Thanks. And then if I could just follow up quickly on the two acquisitions and their contributions in the quarter, very nice sequential pick up on Dynetics, and just, you know, how things are tracking there versus your expectations for the year and into \u201821?. And then slight sequential step down in airport security products and kind of how things are shaping up there given what's happening in the air travel environment? Roger Krone : Yeah, I'll do sort of the qualitative. And if Jim wants to put a little bit of quantitative out there he can. But let me start from the act of integrating. Okay, that's, you know, back office systems people, and the both Dynetics and security detection, automation business are doing really quite well. I mean, we're ahead of our milestones. We're getting systems converted, people convert into our employee system. And so that's going really, really well. From a leadership standpoint, we're just really pleased and excited that the leadership team of both organizations have continued to stay. And we're very happy that we've literally re-launched [ph] nobody off of either senior leadership team. The Dynetics business, because of Lander and some other things is ahead of our expectations. And we integrated them with our latest innovation center. And that has really created some cross-linking into our existing R&D business, which is really, really exciting. I think you touched on what's going on in air traffic, we were over a million passengers like two weeks ago, and then this sort of second wave has tempered that a little bit. And so we have seen - we've got a couple foreign bids that have gotten delayed by a couple weeks. TSA is actually move forward with CT at the checkpoint opportunities, but our expectation is, it's going to be a long recovery. And orders are going to stretch to the right. And so there was I think a good cause to have a balanced view of our security detection or automation business. But - and by the way, for us, that's almost good, because we get a chance to really focus on integration, and get those systems and processes into what we call the Leidos business framework, and where we want them before we see any significant ramp up. But \u2013 we\u2019ve seen air traffic, I think the UK just went on a month shutdown. And so this second wave, third wave is going to be problematic. And I think we're very circumspect about that. And its effect it will have on our business. But a great opportunity for us to get our CT product to the market and to get things through the qualification process with TSA. So again, we're very excited about that business. It's just, we're in the middle of this second wave in the pandemic. Jim, I don\u2019t know if you want to talk about numbers? James Reagan : Just to amplify what you said, Roger, the Dynetics business is performing in some metrics better than we expected on some \u2013 or spot on and we're pleased with how that business is accelerating through integration. And as you said, that's tempered with the other acquisition which is seeing some of the COVID-19 impacts, not so much with win rates, but more how some awards and some deliveries have been pushed out as a result of the pandemic. Thanks. Seth Seifman : Okay. Thank you very much. James Reagan : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : The next question is from the line of Matt Akers of Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Matt Akers : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Roger Krone : Good morning, Matt. Matt Akers : I want to follow up real quickly on the CR commentary and specifically the 3610 extension, I just want to ask, how important is that specifically, I think, based on some of the commentary from some of your peers, I think it's not alike a lot of people covered by 3610 had already sort of returned to work. So if you could just comment on sort of how big that is for you at this point? Roger Krone : Yeah, well, I'm happy to share our numbers. So 97% of our team is back at work on regular hours. So we have really only about a percent and a half at a reduced standing. And that's the people that would really be affected by 3610. And then we have a 1.5 is kind of miscellaneous, just some structural things. And so it's really not a big impact for us anymore. I think that's - we've seen that across the industry, and certainly our peers in these agencies. I think it - there's some things around 3610 that maybe more important for some of the bigger aerospace primes, relative to factories and things. But that doesn't affect many of our programs. Because of the nature of our work, which is really, people come into work. And you know, they're writing software and doing mission and things like that. And so not as important as it was at the beginning of this journey, which still be nice to have. And - but we don't see a major impact. Matt Akers : Okay, thanks. That's helpful. I guess, if I could just one more on sort of budget risk next year. I think that's kind of the biggest concern I see from investors. But yeah, I guess if you just sort of look across your addressable market, are there certain areas that you think are maybe more susceptible to budget cuts, as you look out over the next couple years, as opposed to maybe other areas that you think are more well protected? And how do you think about sort of positioning Leidos within that? Roger Krone : Yeah, and we've talked about at the last quarter, and I\u2019ll just reiterate some of our themes. If you're in support of legacy programs within DoD, I mean, that\u2019s probably not a great place to be, you want to be an emerging technologies, I think, regardless of who gets elected. And the Biden campaign is, you know, come out and said, they're not looking to cut defense. And we think that's true, that means that they are not going to cut it. They probably wouldn't grow it as fast as a second Trump administration would. Then they're shifting our priorities. I think Biden is going to kind of go back to international alliances and maybe reopen trade. I think Trump will continue what he has done. We think, in any administration, pandemic response, health care, civil infrastructure, we think our return to the moon program is strongly supported, by the way from both sides of the aisle, both administrations have said that. And, I've said this in many, many calls is, everybody gets elected or re-elected, you know, with hopes and ambitions and a set of priorities, and then you walk in the office, and you're faced with a record deficit, there is a 8%, 9% unemployment, and, you know, you're on the precipice of a recession. And so I think either administration is going to look for another CARES Relief Act. I think the tax increase which is reported in the Biden administration will be delayed, because the last thing I want to do is tamp down economic growth, because that's how we pull ourselves out of this large unemployment. And so I actually think that 2021 looks a lot like 2020. And 2022, is already in planning. Its in what we call the Palm and EPP [ph] cycle, if you talk to customers, they've already put their budgets in for \u201822. And of course, our backlog takes us well into \u201823, and \u201824, before our programs start to be affected. And so there will be changes in priorities, more civil infrastructure, I think we got to get pandemic response ready, and that CDC and organizations like FEMA, and NIAID and USAID and NIH, all of which we have been carefully positioning the company with a balanced portfolio to be able to address what would be a shifting priorities in the federal government. And so we're very happy with where we're positioned, and we're going to continue to stay up late tomorrow night, and see who got elected, but I think we're going to be in great shape by the way. Matt Akers : Okay. Thank you. Roger Krone : Yeah. Thanks, Matt. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jeffries. Please proceed with your questions. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Hi. Good morning, Roger and Jim. Roger Krone : Hi. Good morning, Sheila. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Roger, don't tell us 2021 is going to look like 2020. I don't think anybody wants that. So\u2026 Roger Krone : Great point. Absolute, great point. Sheila Kahyaoglu : How do we - I want to ask first on revenue drivers in defense and civil, what's going on in those businesses? I appreciate the X COVID impact they were up 6% and 2% organically. So what are some of the puts and takes and how do we think about those going forward? Roger Krone : Sheila before Jim answers that, I'll just comment when the kids come around on Halloween dressed as a calendar in 2020, nobody wants to repeat what we did this year. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Exactly. James Reagan : Yeah. So in particular defense and civil revenue drivers, both for - actually for, you know, the back end of this year and into next. Some program wins that represented takeaways, and growth in existing programs are really the drivers. And we had an Air Force takeaway. For example, I'll just give you a couple of examples. Something called ACC ISR, which was a takeaway. There's a contract in CBP, that is a traveler vetting system contract that we won. And these are the kinds of things that are providing us organic growth. And again, that's in the defense business. If we want to think about it in the civil, inorganically, obviously, it's SD&A. But there's also some growth of existing programs that we're looking at for next year, and the DOE. The NETL contract is one example. And then also we have some expansion in our MSA contract there as well. So those are the things that had been driving revenue growth. But you know, probably also interesting is margin expansion, that we're seeing both in those two businesses and really across the whole portfolio that has to do with really strong program performance and effective management of indirect costs, as we kind of work through the pandemic. And these have been things that have more than offset some of the headwinds that we've had from COVID-19. And it really is a testament to the program teams and the management team that are out there driving those improvements. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay. Thanks, Jim for that. And then one more for you. Because we can't seemingly keep up with your puts and takes for free cash flow. So just to clarify on the - because of the pre-funding of the $1 billion bond or the financing of that, how do we think about AR, for this year is it net neutral and how that flows over to 2021? James Reagan : Yeah. So for the full year, the impact of our AR monetization facility is going to be zero. Previously, we had included in our guidance, a $300 million add that shows up in operating cash flow, that is in effect the sale of our receivables at a very, very low cost of capital. And we don't need to do that now to maintain the level of liquidity that we want. We've got ample liquidity, so we don't need that anymore. So you can think about, the $1.2 billion guide that we have today as being a $300 million improvement from a performance standpoint versus where we were last quarter. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay, great. Thank you. James Reagan : Thank you, Sheila. Roger Krone : Thanks, Sheila. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please proceed with your questions. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Thank you very much. Could you just refresh us in terms of the Defense, Health and the Army SOCOM protests, approximately how large were they? And when do you expect the protest timeline to be over? Roger Krone : Okay, Cai, let me see if I can get these right. First of all, the total number we have in protest is about $9.3 billion. So if you add all the programs that we have collectively. The - what we call RHRP program is rounded to a $1 billion, give or take a little bit and it doesn't mean that's exactly what we'll book when we achieve the protest. And I think that's in January, right, we don't get that till January. And then the other program we refer to it as STAMP, which stands on, of course, for something is about $600 million, 650 million. And then, of course, you add NextGen to that at about eight [ph] maybe a little less that 7778 and that gets you to about $9.3 billion. And I think the STAMP, we're hopeful will happen in fourth quarter. So if it doesn't get reprotested, which we're getting used to. But then maybe NextGen you didn't ask, I touched on it in my remarks. We're kind of - whether it's before Thanksgiving or after Thanksgiving, it's hard to tell. You do oral arguments. The Court of Federal Claims is not - you can't set your clock by it, like you can with the GAO. And so we'll go to oral arguments, and then we're in the hands of the judge, and he can make a rule and anytime after oral arguments, you know, from that day to probably a couple of weeks. Cai von Rumohr : Terrific. And then the second one would be, your margins were good. And you measure - you know, you've talked about the COVID headwind, to what extent do you feel that COVID was a tailwind in terms of indirect expenses benefiting from lower travel and meeting expenses, and utilization benefiting from lower paid vacation time off? Because there was fewer places for people to go? Roger Krone : Yeah. Cai, that certainly was a factor. I don't know whether it's 20 or 30 bps, maybe something like. I mean, it's a little hard to put our finger on it. But clearly made a difference. And our medical costs are down double-digit millions. And the challenge for all of us - and it's all relatively good. The challenge I think for us and for the industry is to decide what comes back and what doesn't. We're at somewhere between 25% and 50% occupancy in our buildings, and we're running just fine. We have 65% of our employees are telecommuting, and they're doing reasonably well, I think, you know, actually very well. And we start to look at 2021 and say, we need less real estate. We don't need to go to all the trade shows that we've been to or at least not in person. Some of the virtual work that we've done on AUSA and AFA have worked actually extremely well. We've actually talked to more general officers because you consume them and you can do one right after another and they don't get caught in somebody else's show booth, right. So we are really taking a look at the lessons learned. And we want to capture and internalize significant portion of that reduction in our margin going forward. And I think you're seeing that across the board. Cai von Rumohr : Terrific. Thank you very much. Roger Krone : Yeah. Thanks, Cai. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Jon Raviv : Hi. Thank you. I was going to ask you this question. But Jim, since you didn't fully answer it, maybe I'll take another whack at it. It's just about big moving pieces into 2021. Thanks for clarifying the AR this year. But thinking about \u201821 over \u201820 cash flow, you know, are we sort of still looking at about a $1 billion operating cash, I think that number is thrown [ph] around previously? Or can we actually sustain it as 1.2 or greater going into 21 with all those moving pieces, including I know payroll tax and whatnot? Thank you. James Reagan : Yeah. Jon, we'll have more to say about that when we issue our guidance at the end of the fourth quarter of call. We were purposeful in not putting all the details out there, because we're still working through that. I would tell you that this year has been benefit - has been benefited significantly by the ability to defer taxes into next year. And we'll have a lot of the moving parts for that available, when we give you the kind of a walk of this year's cash flow to next year. Another thing you have to remember is that next year, we're not going to have a repeat of VirnetX. That was $80 million. So, the strength of this year's cash conversion is really been on the backs of the CARES Act legislation, VirnetX strong program performance and our continued focus on monetizing receivables, getting things built faster, getting them collected faster. So now, we always have these things that I refer to as recurring, non-recurrings, but we just - we can't plan those. But who knows what next year's tailwind on cash flow might be. But like I said, we'll have more to say about that in next quarters call. Jon Raviv : Yeah, I appreciate that. Thanks, Jim. And then just on your the incremental debt raise. So you just clarify, how much are you actually taking out with that $1 billion or is it all just additional? And then you mentioned your capital permanent [ph] priorities? But you know, with that additional debt you're sort of looking - you know, you mentioned some tuck-in M&A capabilities? What are some of those opportunities that might be out there, at this point size wise and market wise and capability wise? Thank you. James Reagan : Yeah, I'll answer the first part of that question. And Roger, can speak to the second half about what we might be interested in. But out of the $1 billion raise, we paid off debt to the tune of 750. And we left $250 million in the cash account to give us the kind of flexibility that we're talking about. And then Roger can speak to the kinds of things that could represent tuck-ins. We don't have anything specific. But, you know, like I said, we want to have some flexibility. And that's why we're keeping some cash around. Roger Krone : Yeah. You know, Jon, we're always working a pipeline of where do we want to be? What are the technologies that support the programs that we see 3 and 5 years out, and then we take a look internally, within what we call our tactical core competencies, and whether we're deep enough or not. There tends to be kind of a make by decision and time to market. And there's - you know, at any given time, we'll have a half a dozen $50 million to $250 million deals kind of in a pipeline. And some are in diligence, some were just - were wishful. And, you know, don't really have anything to say. At this time, of course, we never comment on M&A anyway. But I don't think anything that's going to surprise you. I mean, you've been listening to the calls, you know, where we're moving. And digital transformation, hypersonic space, cyber, physical cyber, electronic warfare, that the whole list that we've been talking about for a long time. And there are some companies that have been in kind of PE or venture capital that are looking for liquidity event. And by the way one point I made before maybe interesting to remind everyone, usually the companies that we buy, we've had a relationship with for a long time. We do over and under, they might be a sub to us. We've probably been working with these companies for 5 years, some up to a decade. And we know the management team well, we know the technology well. And especially the culture of the company, culture is really a big thing for us and want people that will fit with our organization. We're a little different. Because we're employee-owned for so long, with sort of a more of an open collaborative culture and culture is really big deal for us. But - and if it doesn't work out, that we're happy to have them in a partnership relationship going forward. But that's kind of what we're looking at. Jon Raviv : Thank you. Roger Krone : Yeah. Operator : The next question is from the line of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Rob Spingarn : Hey, good morning. Roger Krone : Hey. Good morning, Rob. Rob Spingarn : I know you don't want a guide to next year. But you did mention that 10% to 12%. And understanding that there is some moving pieces and delays and protests and so forth. Is there a way to talk about that qualitatively by segment? James Reagan : Well, Rob, we don't - as we've said before, we don't guide by segment, right. But to speak to it qualitatively, it is - it really is based on - you know, we're kind of halfway through or near, maybe two thirds of the way through planning for next year. And the, the early returns that are coming up from the units are consistent with kind of what the top down math looks like. Strong book-to-bill over the last 12 months, the contract claims haven't gotten longer. We have some really big enterprise IT programs that are ramping. And, with those we could easily pencil out growth to the tune of what we said earlier on the call. But by segment, today we're seeing expanding margins across each one of our segments. And we think that next year could have some strong organic growth across the entire business, because we're \u2013 and we're pleased that across the portfolio, everything has strong book-to-bills, and that translates to strong organic growth next year. Roger Krone : Hey, Rob, let jump on the back of that is, given our last two quarters and what happened in our health business and the amount of time we spent with the community on how the exam business works, and we tried to be as transparent as we could, is it - if we get to the point where our clinics are shut down, we can't do exams. And so we went through that period, as of course, everyone saw. But those, as we have said, we said on last call, which is repeated again, the exams don't go away. Those disability exams, whether Department of Labor or for the veterans or for Workman's Comp still have to get done. And so we're now faced with sort of an inventory of exams, we have to work our way through. And so we're fortunate we ended the third quarter at higher than COVID levels, although for the quarter, we were probably kind of at or about where we were before, starting lower, ending higher. But we now have to work through that inventory of exams. And that's going to take us well into \u201921 to do so. So again we tried to be transparent with everybody when we had to shut down the clinics and what we\u2019ll look like when we're open, we're now reopened, all of our clinics are open. We still have PPE and we don't have to have appropriate protocols, because the pandemic is clearly alive and well out there. But we expect sort of the tailwind, certainly from the exam business to go significantly under \u201821. Rob Spingarn : Okay. Similar question, maybe higher level and looking at a little bit further, but with the potential changes in strategy, if we have a change in administration, longer term, Roger, how do we think about your service exposure changing in the defense business? I'm talking about Army, Navy, Air Force exposure. Is that something you can speak about? Roger Krone : Yeah. I'll touch a little bit and then maybe if we have time at the end, you can ask a second question. Yeah, I - and I get, you know, I always get wrapped up when you use the word service. I want to stop and talk about, the lower end services is not the business that you find the Leidos in, is that we tend to be mission-focused. We don't do services, right. We do solutions and we partner with our customers on mission. But a comment, maybe we're leading to is like what will happen in the AOR in the Middle East and, you know, Trump had made a commitment to pull troops down and there have been troops, we have reduced our footprint in the Middle East. And I think we all anticipated that that is likely to continue. I think under either administration, the number is not going to go to zero. And part of what we do is we provide support not for the US troops, but for the Afghans. Some of our aviation programs are in direct support of Afghan operations by Afghanis. But we could see sort of a slowing down of some of the work that we do in theater, which, frankly, is a wonderful thing. It means we don't have troops at risk. But the customers are going to take that obligation authority, and they're going to spend it in other areas, they may spend it in modernization, which is great for us, because we're well positioned in the future of our customers. But what we have all learned is that if a quiets down in Iraq and Afghanistan, it's going to get hot someplace else. And unfortunately, history has told us is that there's always a place to deploy troops. But I will tell you that we have been fortunate to subtly shift our portfolio out of that very, very low end and our OCO numbers are very small. And, and so we're fairly well insulated to what I would call that pure services play, if that were to be de-emphasized in the budget. Rob Spingarn : Yeah, what I was thinking about is just to - writ large of Army became a bill payer for growth at Air Force, Navy, and in space, clearly at Dynetics, you have very good exposure to all those growing things. So that's the way I was thinking about it. That's certainly something that investors are asking us. Roger Krone : Yeah. And again, why don\u2019t I let you go and we'll come back. I would simply say, we haven't seen it. Our support contracts to the army is doing fine. I think there's some things around army and strengths and, you know, requires a longer conversation rather than I use everybody else's time. But, Rob, maybe we'll call you after the call when we can talk a little bit more about what we think is going on in the army. Rob Spingarn : Okay, thanks. Operator : The next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Peter Arment : Yes, thanks. Good morning, Roger, Jim. Roger, just maybe just to talk briefly about kind of a follow on to Rob's question about \u201821. Just specifically, when we think about the SD&A businesses, just to clarify, do we - is there an expectation that that visibility there in \u201821 will actually - we'll see a return to growth of that business? Or how should we be thinking about this the revenue profile of that business? Roger Krone : You know, it's a little early for us to know with specificity, that part of what we call our security products business, which is actually being integrated in with the legacy Leidos business. I think that right now, we're not viewing that as being a big grower for next year, just because of what we think of is kind of that hangover from COVID-19. However, yeah, we can probably have more color on that in the next call as we have more visibility into how well the order pipeline has developed. Peter Arment : Okay. And just as a quick follow on, just regarding your ability in general to add new hires in this environment, how is that been proceeding? Thanks. Roger Krone : It's been terrific. We went to a virtual hiring platform. We do virtual new employee orientation. We've got employees who are part of the company or working from home who have never been to a Leidos building. And we're very, very fortunate that people see what's going on with the company. They understand our culture. They love the work, they love working together, and they love the workplace flexibility that we now offer. And so hiring has not been a constraint for us. We were hoping that we would have had Navy, NextGen in our portfolio by now. That is going to require a significant, literally above 1000 people. And we hope that will be our problem next year. And we'll add that. And of course, we've added a lot of people through the acquisitions that Dynetics and the SD&A. All told between direct hiring and acquisitions, we'll probably add around 9000 people this year. Peter Arment : Terrific. Thanks so much. Roger Krone : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Gavin Parsons with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Gavin Parsons : Good morning. Roger Krone : Good morning, Gavin James Reagan : Good morning, Gavin Gavin Parsons : Jim, just quick one on guidance assumptions. In the last quarter, you guys provided a pretty helpful slide on the sizing of COVID and the engine push out, I was wondering if you could just update us on the 2020 expected impact of COVID to revenue and EBITDA? James Reagan : We haven't provided anything specific. I can tell you that the change in the expectation on COVID-19 in 2020, is the revenue impact is going to be a little bigger, but it isn't materially bigger and that operating income impact on COVID-19 for the full year is a little bit lower, because of the recovery that we've seen in Q3 being a little bit faster than we had expected when we talked to you a quarter ago. Gavin Parsons : Sorry, just to clarify, you're saying the revenue headwind is larger than you'd been anticipating last quarter for all of this year? James Reagan : A little bit, no I wouldn't call it material. It's a small number. Gavin Parsons : Got it. Okay. And then, Roger, the comment on visibility into growth is really helpful, just on the authority and outlay is catching up to authority and the unobligated balance, your visibility in the backlog. But if I look at, you know, just kind of the main [ph] Investor Day and the anticipation of a 5% addressable growth CAGR for your adjustable markets, how do you think about planning differently given, you know, the political uncertainty, and the budget deficit, and then whether or not you're still on a growth posture for a 5 year outlook, and then whether or not that changes how you plan for the business? Thanks. Roger Krone : Yeah. Okay. I'll try to be short, because I know we're running late. But first of all, you raised the unobligated balance, by our numbers it's $130 billion. So there's a ton of budget overhang of, if you will unspent prior authorized balances. So add that to the CR, and you see your way through \u201821 and \u201822. And clearly at our Investor Day, we were talking 5%, we're kind of - our conversation now begins at 10, and goes north from there. We run the same scenario, as everybody else does, what is the federal deficit, what it takes to get to a balanced budget. Those numbers are in such large magnitude, I mean, you could remove the NASA budget completely, and you don't even make a dent. So we have some longer structural things as a country that we need to better understand, and there are some inflation, that has to happen. And so you can pay debt off 10 years with inflated dollars and things. But what we have heard talking both administrations and the Hill is we need economic growth, that's what's going to get us back on firm footing. And you can't make huge reductions in federal spending, and get the economic recovery that you need over the next three to five years  So we may see a little bit of top line temperament. But I think the big change that we're going to see is, if Biden were to get elected versus Trump, a reprioritization of what is a federal government budget that grows kind of with GNP, so you're talking 2.7%, 2.8%, maybe 3% GNP growth, and if you plot history, President to President, the federal government spending is pretty constant, what changes his priorities within the two administrations are within different administrations. And, you know, we think we've done a really good job of portfolioing this company so that we can shift to more health and infrastructure if a Biden government were to go in that direction. We've talked a lot, I don't want to go on too much. But I don't think you solve the deficit problem with spending, I think you're going to have to find sources of revenue. And everybody says, oh, that means taxes. And we said, yeah, probably eventually, we could see the corporate rate start to creep back to where it was. But other sources of revenue, like users fees and parks and things like that, it's just what's going to have to happen. Its going to take some smarter people than I to figure out how we pay off these trillions and trillions of dollars that we borrowed to keep people employed. So but with that, I think we again we got to wrap it up, but we can follow up with you on one on one. Gavin Parsons : Thanks. Operator : Thanks. At time I\u2019ll turn the floor back to management for closing comments. Peter Berl : Thanks, Rob. Thank you all for your time this morning and for your in Leidos. We look forward to updating you again soon. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings. Welcome to the Leidos Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the conference over to Peter Berl, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Berl, you may begin. Peter Berl : Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of the Leidos management team. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter ending January 1st, 2021. Roger will lead off the call with notable highlights from the quarter, as well as comments on the market environment and our Company's strategy. Jim will follow with a discussion of our financial performance and our guidance expectations. After these remarks from Roger and Jim, we\u2019ll open the call for your questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific Risk Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, during the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in the press release that we issued this morning, it is also available in the presentation slides. The press release and presentation as well as supplementary financial information file are provided on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.leidos.com. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Roger Krone. Roger Krone : Thank you. Peter, and thank you all for joining us this morning for our fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings conference call. Before we closed the door on last year, I'd like to take a moment to thank the approximately 39,000 Leidos employees, our business partners and our customers for their unwavering commitment and collaboration in light of the COVID challenges. I'm inspired by what we accomplished in the past year together, and the challenges that we will solve in this New Year for the betterment of our communities and our customers mission. Fourth quarter results reflect the resilience of our growing portfolio with new record levels of revenue and backlog coupled with margin expansion and further balance sheet optimization. This performance positions us for above market growth in 2021, fueled by our talented, diverse workforce who continue to engineer and deliver technologically innovative and secure solutions for our customers evolving needs. Revenues for the quarter were $3.25 billion, up 10.1% from the prior year, reflecting two strategic acquisitions that closed in 2020. Q4s adjusted EBITDA of 11.3%, up 30 basis points compared to the prior year period reflects strong program performance and indirect cost management that delivered 8% growth on non-GAAP EPS totaling $1.63 for the quarter. Net bookings of $3.3 billion in the quarter resulted in a book-to-bill slightly above one and 1.4 times on a trailing 12 month basis. These solid results do not reflect any material contributions from the Navy Next Gen program, which was resolved in Leidos\u2019s favor late in the year, the $1.7 billion FAA NISC IV re-compete award that is currently under protest or the $1 billion Military and Family Life Counseling award that was announced in January. These three wins, coupled with a backlog that is more than 2.5 times our historical annual revenue and a healthy new business pipeline provide us with high confidence in our growth outlook in the New Year and beyond. For the full year, we generated record revenue of $12.3 billion, an increase - an annual increase of 10.8%. Full year revenue delivered 10.8% adjusted EBITDA margins that yielded non-GAAP earnings per share of $5.83. This represents 13% growth over the prior year. Additionally, the business generated over $1.3 billion of cash from operations for the year, far exceeding our initial 2020 guidance. Full year net bookings of $17.8 billion contributed to a record year end backlog position of $31.9 billion, a year-over-year increase of over 32% or a healthy 23% after adjusting for acquired backlog. Turning now to several significant contract actions in the quarter that positioned the business for significant organic growth. In the Defense Solutions segment, the US Court of Federal Claims ruled in favor of our Navy customers award of the NGEN program where Leidos will unify, operate and maintain the shore-based networks and data management to the Department of the Navy's Program Executive Office Digital to improve capability and service under one enterprise network construct. The single award, IDIQ has a five-year base period of performance followed by three one-year option periods, with an approximate value of $7.7 billion, if all options are exercised. Due to the timing of the court's decision, no significant task orders were booked in the fourth quarter. Also in the Defense Solutions segment, the GAO denied a protest clearing the path of the US SOCOM Tactical Airborne Multi- Center Sensor Platform support task order, also known as STAMP II to Leidos. Under the contract, Leidos will provide pilot services, airborne sensor operations, hub and spoke operations and excursion support, as well as under other engineering support services in support of the programs DeHavilland Dash 8 and King Air 300 aircraft. The award has a total value of $649 million and includes a one-year base period of performance, followed by four one-year option periods. Additionally, within the intelligence community, the company was awarded contracts collectively valued at $304 million, if all options are exercised. Though the specific nature of these contracts are classified, they encompass mission-critical services that help to counter global threats and strengthen national security. This morning, we announced the second of two strategic acquisitions that occurred over the last several months. Similar to transactions we closed in 2020, these recent deals support our strategic framework of adding capabilities and deepening customer relationships. We expect Gibbs & Cox and 1901 Group to be immediately accretive to non-GAAP EPS. The acquisition of Gibbs & Cox will extend our existing Maritime business and add specific capabilities and services, such as naval architecture and marine engineering, 3d modeling and design and specially engineering to the solution set that we offer to our customers. Gibbs & Cox has a rich history dating back to 1929, and their workforce is highly regarded in the industry and across the globe. In addition to being positioned on the front end of next generation vessels, the business combination provides significant tailwinds for participation in the maritime unmanned market and accelerates Gibbs & Cox expansion in the undersea domain. We anticipate that the transaction will close in the second quarter after the completion of regulatory reviews. Second, in early December, we announced the strategic acquisition of 1901 Group, a leading cloud and digital modernization as a service provider. The transaction is now closed, and this quarter, we welcomed the nearly 400 IT cloud and cyber specialists to the Leidos family. In addition to its deep bench of technical talent, the company has developed a robust as a service delivery model that is scalable, repeatable and affordable. As our customers continue to see on and off-premise managed service solutions, 1901 Group will expand our team's ability to address this accelerating market. Organizationally, 1901 Group is aligned with our Defense group. And through collaboration with our CIO and CTO leadership, we are in the process of leveraging these new capabilities across the enterprise to the benefit of our customers. Looking to the macro environment, with the current year $740 billion NGA passed into law. Attention now turns to the President's pending fiscal year 2022 budget recommendation, which is unlikely to put pressure on Defense industry outlays before fiscal year 2023. Given the great power competition, and leading national security issues, we do not anticipate major cuts, but rather flattish to slightly declining budget numbers with focus on modernization and reprioritization. Also, with projected increased focus on healthcare demands, and civil infrastructure, particularly transportation, we believe that our diverse portfolio of differentiated solutions is well-aligned with the administration's and our customers highest priorities. Next, I want to take a moment to highlight Leidos continued commitment to mental health and well-being of both our employees and our communities, a topic that has been increasingly more front end center for families over the past 12 months. Approximately 3.5 years ago, we launched an initiative to do our part to tackle the opioid epidemic, and challenged other companies to do the same. These efforts organically grew to also address the underlying contributors to substance misuse associated with mental health and well-being, including anxiety, depression, and suicidal tendencies, all exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Last year, we added internal benefits and resources, for example, the offering of the Headspace app to our employees free of charge. We also elevated the conversation in our communities, through continued engagements with the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, with the DEA in support of their national take back days, and by working with the American Foundation for suicide prevention. In the most recent quarter, we formed a strong relationship with the Milken Institute's Center for Public Health, including participating in multiple virtual global panels focused on addressing both mental health and substance misuse. Additionally, Leidos participated in Out of Darkness Suicide Prevention virtual experiences in Washington, DC, and North Alabama. At both events, we raised awareness, as well as critical funds needed to address the stigma surrounding suicide. We look forward to continuing to lead and support these critical health initiatives for our nation's citizens in this New Year. Finally, I would like to mention that Leidos for the fourth consecutive year has been recognized as one of the 2021 world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere Institute, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices. This recognition is a testament to our employees worldwide, who embody this core value. With that, I would turn the call over to Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer for more detail on our results, and our 2021 outlook. Jim Reagan : Thanks, Roger, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I'll start by providing an overview of our 2020 results for both the fourth quarter and full year, followed by a review of 2021 guidance. First, starting with revenue, fourth quarter revenue grew 10.1% over the prior year period, driven by the acquisitions of Dynetics and the Security Detection and Automation businesses, partially offset by 2019, 53-week year, which included a couple of additional business days in its final month. On an organic basis, we experienced contraction of approximately 3% due to the continuation of some COVID-19 impacts, as well as the timing of customer procurements and delayed new starts, which more than offset new program wins and on-contract growth in parts of the portfolio. Our organic growth calculation excludes the performance of acquired businesses until a full year has passed. More details can be found on slide 16 of the earnings presentation, which is available on our Investor Relations website. Full year revenue of $12.3 billion was at the lower end of our guidance range due to one, better than expected indirect cost savings that translated into lower revenue on cost reimbursable programs, two, the favorable decision on the NAVY Next Gen award, which occurred later in the quarter than previously estimated and three, timing on new contract awards and on-contract \u2013 on-contract gross decisions attributable to the ongoing effects of COVID. We expect a number of these events to become tailwind for 2021. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margins were a 11.3%, 30 basis points higher than the prior year period. Our robust margins this quarter were driven by higher margins on new programs and favorable write-ups on existing programs due to strong program performance and reduced indirect rates. We delivered full year adjusted EBITDA margins of 10.8% matching the top end of guidance. This represents our fourth consecutive year exceeding our 10% or higher long-term target. After adjusting for the $81 million net gain from the VirnetX legal matter, and our estimated COVID-19 impacts, adjusted EBITDA margins would have been 10.4%, which is comparable to our 2019 performance. Fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.63 grew $0.12 over the prior year period. Contributions from strong program performance and increased volume on existing and new programs were the primary drivers of the 8% growth year-over-year. We exited the year with non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.83, a 13% increase over 2019, and at the upper end of our guidance range. Cash used in operating activities was $52 million. As projected in the third quarter earnings call, the net cash outflows were driven by the full repayment of the accounts receivable monetization facility, resulting in zero utilization of the facility at year end. It is also worth noting that we completed $67 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter, delivering on our commitment to return value to our shareholders. Our remaining share repurchase authorization under the program is approximately 7 million shares. Full year operating cash flows of $1.3 billion benefited primarily from two non-recurring items, the $81 million net received from the VirnetX legal matter and $123 million of CARES Act deferred payroll taxes. These items coupled with strong balance sheet management, higher labor utilization, and the accelerated collection of receivables previously planned for 2021 drove a 34% increase over 2019 exceeding our previous guidance for operating cash flows. You may recall that the original 2020 guide for operating cash flow was $1 billion. And to recap, the stronger cash from 2021 resulted from first, that $123 million of CARES Act payroll tax deferral, two, net advance payments of $74 million, four - excuse me, three, higher staff utilization of about $70 million, and three \u2013 four, the VirnetX cash flow issue of $81 million that was a tailwind for cash flow in the year. Bookings of $3.3 billion for the quarter resulted in a 1.0 times book-to-bill with record ending backlog of $31.9 billion. For the year, we booked over $17.7 billion of net awards, reflecting a 23% increase over 2019 and driving a 1.4 times book-to-bill for the year. And now for an overview of our segment results. Defense Solutions revenue increased 16.5% over the prior year quarter and contracted 1.6% organically. Driving the strong growth was the Dynetics acquisition and the ramping of new programs. This growth was partially offset by delays to new awards, such as the NAVY NGEN and STAMP II contracts, material timing and reduced volume on legacy contracts. And for the full year, Defense Solutions grew 16.5% over 2019, including 1.7%, organically. Non-GAAP operating margins in the Defense Solution segment of 8.9% contracted 90 basis points from the prior year quarter. The primary drivers of this change were a reduction in program volumes and the successful settlement of an outstanding legal matter in the fourth quarter of 2019, which drove higher margins a year ago. Defense Solutions booked over $2.3 billion in net awards, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.2 times for the quarter. For the full year, Defense Solutions booked nearly $9 billion in net awards, a 5% increase over the prior year and driving a 1.2 times book-to-bill for the full year. With regard to our Defense Solutions segment M&A, we are very pleased with Dynetics contribution to the segment. The business delivered on the annualized revenue commitment. And we are particularly pleased with Dynetics pro forma full year growth rate of 50%, as well as the business's positioning in the New Year. In our Civil segment, revenue grew 5% over the prior year quarter, and contracted 6.6% organically. The top line growth was driven by the acquisition of the Security Detection And Automation Businesses and new program wins. This increase was offset by reduced volumes on existing contracts and COVID-19 impact \u2013 as COVID-19 impacts to programs with our FAA and National Science Foundation customers. Civil non-GAAP operating margins of 12.3% increased 30 basis points over the prior year quarter. The primary drivers of the strong margins this quarter were product timing and mix, favorable net write-ups due to increased cost efficiencies on certain programs and reduced indirect rates. The Civil segment delivered full year non-GAAP operating margins of 11.7%, an 80 basis point increase over the prior year. Civil recorded over $700 million in net bookings for the quarter, resulting at a 0.9 times book-to-bill and a 2.2 times book-to-bill for the full year. Turning to the segments M&A, the SD&A business was impact by a longer than previously expected decline in air travel, resulting in lower revenue for the year. Despite the extended effects of the global pandemic, we are pleased with our technology and competitive positioning as the market begins its path to recovery during the latter half of 2021. And finally turning to our Health segment. Health segment revenues contracted 2.5% over the prior year quarter. The reduction was driven by lower material purchases on certain CMS programs, and new business delays, partially offset by COVID-19 impact recoveries, particularly in our Medical Exam business. On a full year basis, and after adjusting for acquisition and divestiture activity, the Health segment grew approximately 1% organically. Our Health segment continues to be our hardest - our highest margin segment, generating non-GAAP operating margins of 18.5% in the quarter, a record high. This 250 basis point increase over the prior year quarter was driven by favorable net write-ups due to risk avoidance on certain programs, strong program performance on existing contracts, and lower volume of business investments on a commercial IT venture. For the full year, Health segment non-GAAP operating margins were in line with 2019 increasing 10 basis points to 14.4%. The Health segments saw approximately $230 million of net bookings in the quarter, driving a book-to-bill of 0.5x with a full year book-to-bill of 1.1 times. And before I transition to next year's guidance, I want to give you an update on where we stand versus the three year financial targets that we shared with you at our 2019 Investor Day event. With two years now in the books, our organic revenue growth is running at 5.5% CAGR versus the 5% target we laid out at Investor Day. Free cash flow conversion of 127% is well ahead of our 100% or better target and adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.6% exceeds the 10% established floors [ph] As you may recall, we also had a $2.7 billion balanced cash deployment plan, and with one year to go we've already deployed a total of $2.2 billion. As we head into 2021, our disciplined capital allocation philosophy remains the same. We remain committed to being appropriately levered and maintaining our investment grade rating, returning a quarterly dividend to our shareholders, reinvesting for growth both organically and inorganically and returning excess cash to shareholders in a tax efficient manner. Now on to our 2021 guidance, which does not include the Gibbs & Cox deal that we announced this morning, and as we've done in the past, we will provide an update at our next quarterly earnings conference call after the receipt of regulatory approvals, and deal closing. For 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $13.7 billion to $14.1 billion, reflecting growth in the range of 11% to 15% over 2020. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect to grow more than 10% organically. This organic growth is driven by three factors, the contributions from contracts that successfully cleared protests, such as Navy NGEN and STAMP II, the accelerated recovery in our Medical Exam business, and growth from acquisitions and additional new business, including our most recent Neflect [ph] win in the health segment. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins of 10.3% to 10.5% for the year. After adjusting for the $81 million net gain realized in 2020 from the VirnetX legal matter, and the estimated COVID-19 impacts, 2021 adjusted EBITDA margins are consistent with 2020. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS between $6.15 and $6.45 on the basis of 144 million shares outstanding. We expect operating cash flow in 2021 of at least $850 million. This guidance reflects increased net income in 2021 and also incorporates the partial repayment of $65 million in 2020 CARES Act payroll tax deferrals, $50 million in burn down of the prior years customer advances and $170 million of increased working capital to support 2021s top line growth. For additional context, the business has delivered 120% free cash flow conversion of net income across the three-year time frame of 2018 through 2020. We expect to deliver above 100% conversion across comparable time intervals going forward. And one other item to note. While we may utilize our accounts receivable monetization facility from time to time for short term or strategic actions, our 2021 operating cash flow guidance does not include any contribution from the facility that was established in early 2020. Now a couple of other comments to help you with modeling 2021. We expect net interest expense of approximately $179 million, excluding transaction related expenses. We also expect a slightly higher non-GAAP tax rate in 2021 of 22%. Capital expenditures are targeted at approximately $170 million, a 7% decrease from 2020. As you may recall, 2020 capital expenditures were elevated due to the real estate investment costs associated with the build out of our new headquarters and other real estate optimization activities. Our normalized go forward run rate for CAG - excuse me, for CapEx is targeted at below 1.5% of revenue. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob, so we can take some questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions. Joseph DeNardi : Thanks. Good morning. Roger Krone : Hey, good morning. Joseph DeNardi : Jim. Just \u2013 good morning. Just so we can have an idea in terms of the SD&A business and kind of how levered that is to recovery and commercial, you know, air passenger volumes, I mean, how much of the $500 million that you're expecting from that business was kind of service-related versus more hardware? And maybe what's your assumption for that contribution from the business to 2021? Jim Reagan : Well, that that business, you know, we don't guide by division, Joe. But what I would say is that, the bulk of what you're seeing, and what we talked about is - its roughly, half of it is driven by reduction in product sales, where customers have deferred making orders or receipt of orders, and then roughly half of it is driven in lower services. And the reason for lower services is that with a lot of lanes closed, there's less machines that require surface, obviously, and customers are looking for ways to reduce their outlays on that, as a lot of this is funded by customer passenger fees, and that kind of thing. Joseph DeNardi : Okay. That's helpful. And then Roger, I want to ask this question in a way that maybe you can answer it. But there was a proxy filed on Friday that suggested a company of your size made an all stock offer, albeit at a lower price, and were perspective [ph] ended up. I am wondering if you could just talk about your willingness to use, you know, a meaningful amount of equity for M&A. Just kind of the overall philosophy at this point on larger M&A? Thank you. Roger Krone : Yeah. Hey, thanks, Joe. Of course, you know, we don't comment on deals that don't close and deals that may be in process or may not be. And what we have always said is, we want to be smart in the market. And we want to have dialogue with all of our competitors and potential partners. And so we have a great relationship with the leaders in all the companies in our market space, and we often have discussions. But on any particular deal or at any particular time, I have absolutely no comment. We like our size and scale. We've said that in the past. We are really excited about the scope, acquisitions that we have made in the last now two years. And you know, they've significantly added to our capability. But we have told you all and the street is that we believe we have a responsibility to look at everything and provide some insight into what's going on in the marketplace, to with our management team and our board. And so we will take a look at everything. But you should look at the deals that close. Joseph DeNardi : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much, and good morning. I was wondering, I guess in terms of, you know, where sales came in this quarter, you raise the sales guidance by $100 million at the last earnings and kind of just kind of bumped up against the bottom of the range. In the quarter you talked a little bit about timing of procurement and delayed new starts during the prepared remarks. I guess maybe can you elaborate on that a little bit more, where that stuff came up the most? And how you see it kind of breaking loose over the next few quarters? Roger Krone : Yeah. Seth, let me start and talk about the programs and then Jim can touch on numbers if he would like. When we raised our guidance, we had Navy Next Gen, it was in the Court of Federal Claims. And we - Court of Federal Claims is a little bit unpredictable. Unlike the GAO process, which has a rigorous calendar and is kind of a 99-day thing. And it was our best estimate that the Court of Federal Claims would rule, frankly, before the Thanksgiving holiday. And at one time, we thought it would actually happen in the second week of November. That did not happen. We didn't get a ruling out of the Court of Federal Claims until December. So that delayed the start up of the Next Gen program, buy at least a month, maybe more. And then the other thing that happened with this third wave of COVID, which, you know, I think COVID is very difficult to predict. Our indirect costs went down even further, as we went back to mandatory telework. And we saw our overhead and G&A costs go down even further than we had anticipated, and because about half of our portfolio is a cost type contracts, when we see a reduction in cost, it pulls revenue down with it. And those were the two major drivers. Maybe I'll turn it over to Jim, if he wants to add some more color. Jim Reagan : Sure. Yeah. And if you want to think about the delta between kind of the midpoint of our prior guide, and where we ended up, it's roughly four things there equally spread, think of a quarter of it being lower volumes than we had previously forecasted, in the Medical Exam business, we thought the recovery would be a little bit bigger there is the indirect rate issue, the indirect cost issue that Roger just alluded to. Then there was about a quarter [ph] of it was COVID-19 impacts in the Civil group. And then the rest of it, about a quarter of it was just the delays in the program start-ups for NGEN, and some other contract wins. Seth Seifman : Okay, okay. Thanks. That's helpful. Okay, and then so, like when we see in the press release, you guys talk about the COVID impact. Is there - is what's called out in the item in the press release. Is that - was that more than $12 million on the top line? Roger Krone : I'm not sure I understand your question Seth, could you restate I maybe? Seth Seifman : Oh, yeah. Just like - I think in the in the release, it talks about for the quarter and fiscal year 2020 COVID adversely impacted revenues by $12 million. So is that kind of what you're referring to in terms of the COVID impacts on you know, versus what you expected? Or is there - is that sort of, you know, just an actual year-on-year decline due to COVID. And then there were other things that were supposed to happen that didn't? Roger Krone : Yeah. Well, you know, what you see us talking about during, you know, when we discussed our results a few minutes ago is the year-over-year declines relative to COVID. Seth Seifman : Okay. Roger Krone : What we - when we talked about the number versus what we had previously forecast, obviously, that's going to be different. So you've got two components, one the year-over-year delta, but there's also the amount of business growth that we expected, that got impacted by COVID-19 as well. Seth Seifman : Okay, great. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you. Roger Krone : All right. Thank you, Seth. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. David Strauss : Thanks. Good morning. Roger Krone : Good morning, David. David Strauss : Morning. NGEN, can you give us an idea, when you talked about the program ramping up to $600 million plus on an annual basis? Can you talk about, you know, what you have baked into that - into your rising 10% revenue, organic revenue growth guides for this year in terms of that program ramping up? Jim Reagan : You mean for the guide that we had for 2020 or 2021? David Strauss : For \u201821? So in other words, how fully ramps do you expect NGEN to be in that 2021 guide? And how much - you know, how much should we have the benefit as you fully ramp in \u201922? Jim Reagan : The ramp in NGEN revenue for 2021, we expect it to be ramping up, it will be about 2 to 2.5 points of organic growth for the year. So you can think of that as being somewhere in the $250 million to $300 million range. Roger Krone : Yeah, and just to give you the programmatics, take about 3000 people, about half Leidos employees and we have a transition period, as you're doing these programs, we're in the transition period. So we really haven't started the employee ramp up, that will begin in earnest, really in the second half of the year. And we will be close to fully ramped by the end of the year, but there will still be significant growth in \u201822. So you might expect another two to three points of growth from NGEN in \u201822, as well. David Strauss : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And Roger, you talked about, your view on what happens with the Defense budget from here. Given some of the acquisitions on the Defense side of things, how would you characterize your exposure at this point, just looking at your Defense business to, you know, the operations and maintenance portion of the budget, as opposed to modernization? Roger Krone : You know, what, obviously, we've been doing even within our Defense group is trying to adjust our portfolio. So we're strong in the areas that we see growing. And the 1901 Group is really moving to as a service platform. And we've seen, even in the $1.9 trillion, the Biden administration has set aside some dollars for IT. So we continue to see IT modernization is a great place to be. We see modernization of what we would call newer technology platforms, you know, hypersonics, unmanned vehicles, I mean, and that's really what is got us excited about the one - the deal that we announced today. But you know, we always have a mix, and we've got some programs, that where we support operations, we still have people deployed, although is less than 1% of the business. Our philosophy has always been to try to balance. And again, we stay away from the large marquee platforms in the three services. You know, think of that is, you know, tanks and trucks and airplanes, and big, big surface ships and undersea ships, we tend to be what we think are the smaller, more agile, more responsive capabilities that our customers have. David Strauss : Okay. Thank you very much. Roger Krone : Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Konrad with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Greg Konrad : Good morning. Roger Krone : Good morning, Greg. Greg Konrad : Just transferring from Defense to NASA, you know, under the new administration, maybe there is some changes, or at least a pause, where they kind of figure out the path forward. Can you maybe talk a little bit about the NASA opportunity, particularly at Dynetics, and maybe any expectations around that business? Roger Krone : Well, I mean, I think we're like everyone else. We're waiting for a NASA administrator to be announced. We're enthusiastic about comments that the administration has made about the space program and about technology. And the decision to keep the space council, which we think is a leading indicator. The space programs, both the military and NASA have always been a source of innovation. And needless to say, I think all of us were glued to the television over the last couple of days, and watch the perseverance rover land on Mars, and the excitement that it brought the country. So we're still very enthusiastic about our position with NASA, which is in Dynetics, but I would remind everyone on the call is that we have a significant NASA presence that existed before Dynetics. A lot of people don't know, we've always made the food that goes into space out of the National Food Lab at Johnson Space Center. Specifically about the Lander program, which is I think, where you'd like me to focus, we are at the end of what we call the base phase contract, where we have done a preliminary design on our Lander configuration. We have received a two-month extension from the customer, as they will [ph] about their competitive evaluation of the three bidders. And then we expect that they will make an award relatively on time, either in March or April, and that they will move forward with a Lander development program, consistent with the budget that NASA has remaining in 2021, and then whatever the Biden administration does for 2022. Greg Konrad : Thank you. That's helpful. And then just a follow up to - one of the last questions around kind of the breakout of the impact to revenues in Q4. I know you don't necessarily provide quarterly guidance. I mean, some of those headwinds are probably lifted, some of them maybe continued through 2021. When you think about organic growth throughout 2021, I mean, is it more level loaded? Or should we see some acceleration as stuff like NGEN ramps up in the back half of the year? And maybe some of the COVID impacts, you know, become a little bit less? Roger Krone : Yeah. It's a great question. We definitely see the growth being more backend loaded. As we see some of these recent contract wins. And the resolution of the protests, give us the opportunity to begin ramping, you know, now in the first quarter, but it really isn't until Q3 and Q4, you're going to see the real impact of that. Greg Konrad : Thank you. Roger Krone : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you very much. So Roger, you just did these two acquisitions, maybe give us a little color in terms of how much they would add in terms of revenues, and maybe what their profitability is and kind of how they fit in? Roger Krone : Well, Cai, of course, we don't do that. So we really - they will both be in the Defense segment. Again, we just don't - we don't disclose revenue and EBITDA on our deals and I'll come back to the strategic nature. And you know, 1901 clearly fits with our digital transformation business, which is very significant for us, and accelerates our ability to offer services on an as a service basis, which we believe is a growing trend in the industry. Gibbs & Cox, is an exciting opportunity for us. We've learned a lot about autonomy and the Navy business and in our MUSV program, I think we had a very, very competitive bid, but we didn't win. And as good as we were about the mission equipment on the autonomy, I think there were things that we learned in naval architecture and ship design. And in the discussions with Gibbs & Cox, we're very excited about how Gibbs & Cox brings their capability around the design of the ship and the ship systems. And we bring, if you will, the mission equipment. And we're really excited about how that will fuel growth for our Maritime business going forward. And Cai, we\u2019ll talk a lot more about Gibbs & Cox after closing. We're in that rather sensitive period between signing and closing, where we're starting to file all of our regulatory filings. And so we're going to let that get behind us. And then we'll reach out to you all and talk a little bit more about Gibbs & Cox, and its history and where we see that going. Cai von Rumohr : Got it? And then maybe you could review for us the expected COVID impact, sort of what programs, you know, are the revenues not there because of COVID. You know, and what are the milestones that could kind of turn those back on? Jim Reagan : Well, Cai, this is a gym. There are a number of programs that are impacted. But I'll just review with you some of the examples where COVID will have some impact into what we would normally see in 2021. First, with our National Science Foundation customer, the volume of people in material that have gone down to the ice [ph] and that are coming back, that will be lower, there's a significant construction project that we would have been doing now that has been deferred to a later year, when COVID will largely have abated or be gone and not considered our risk of bringing COVID down to the Antarctic [ph]. Another example is I mean, obviously, we've talked about the impact on the SD&A business where while we've had a revenue impact there, we're working to consolidate operations, get our cost synergies and get the combined business to margins that are well above where the pro forma had been on the acquisition date. The other COVID impacts, we're still recovering and getting to the - what wouldn't be higher than normal volumes in the Medical Exam business. So that business has a lot of backlog to run off and that is included in our view of 2021. And then places where we're not seeing a lingering impact, a significant lingering impact is that, you know, in our Intelligence business, the customers there are largely, you know, not a 100%, but they're getting pretty close to it. And we're pleased with where we see the volume and margin outlook in that business going. So those are a few examples. Roger Krone : Yeah, Cai, I would just reiterate. We think we've taken a very thoughtful view of COVID in our guidance for 2021. And we've all learned a lot about this pandemic and how it affects the economy. And we've really, I think, taken a very informed view of how it affects our business and our programs. And they're, you know, we could go through really 20 or 30 programs or disability business, and their ins and outs. There are some tailwinds because of some things that pushed from last year to this year, that we're excited about. And then clearly transportation, air travel is down and businesses associated with that will be down until the volumes come back. I mean, it's just part of the reality. That being said, border and ports, know that business seems to be going quite well. And so it is a mixed bag, and you should just take comfort is that we have gone literally program-by-program through our portfolio, and taken a thoughtful view of the COVID impact for 2021 in our guidance. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your questions. Peter Arment : Yes. Good morning, Roger, Jim, Peter. Roger Krone : Hey, good morning. Peter Arment : Can you maybe just highlight a little bit about just looking at the Health segment, just the margin performance there continues to be really impressive about kind of the sustainability at these levels. When you think of that business, just all the moving parts that are going on and off, also the ramping up of a new contract there? Thanks. Roger Krone : Sure. Yeah, you know, Peter, the first thing that I would say is that, in our view the margins there are sustainable. And while the Health business didn't have what we normally see in growth there, we continue to think of Health as being a place with above average growth potential. And that's evidenced by our ability to win the two large programs, one of which is under protest in the Health Group, it will get our growth track back to where you've seen it in the past. And then, in terms of what else we like, the margin performance historically in the Health Group has been because we're finding areas where we can apply our differentiated solution and our approach to solving customer problems with customers who are willing to pay us for the value that we bring, and again, bringing margins that are higher than the average for the overall company. Peter Arment : Okay, that's helpful. And just a quick follow up, just on just on re-competes. I know, this is something that you deal with on a daily and annual basis. But is there anything you would call out thinking about, you know, when you're thinking about your growth outlook for this year, heading into next\u2026 Roger Krone : Yeah, you know, this year coming, this \u201821 year is going to have a lot less in terms of re-competes compared to the prior - to 2020. If you think of that, we do have a large re-compete with one of our intelligence customers. We only have one that is - has a contract value of over a $1 billion. And the second largest one is an Army Corps of Engineers. It's called HR3D, that contract is a little over $0.5 billion. And then we have a number of re-competes that are kind of in the $0.5 billion range. But you know, definitely 2020 was a year of re-competes, but not so much in 2021. But with that said, we have a record pipeline. We still have a record amount of bids that are awaiting decision by our customers and we feel that 2021 is going to be yet another year of significant increase to our backlog. Peter Arment : Thanks very much. Operator : Next question is from the line of Gavin Parsons with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Gavin Parsons : Hey, good morning. Roger Krone : Good morning, Gavin. Gavin Parsons : Appreciate all the color on the bridge, the year-over-year bridge for operating cash flow this year. But just wanted to ask, you know, if you have still good visibility into the - as you call them non-recurring, recurring benefits. I mean, I think at one point for 2020 you'd been thinking you could do as much as $300 million of factoring receivables. So is that still an option for this year and just curious why you didn't include any one-time items in guidance? Roger Krone : Yeah, let me touch on some of the strategics. And Jim can walk you through the details. First, we think we understand what the Biden administration is going to do on the payroll tax deferral. And so we put that into our guidance. There was some discussion that they may defer it, if so, that could be a positive about - you know, we have 123 in the deferral, if they decide to defer it another year, not in the $1.9 trillion, but there's a subsequent bill that's likely to come, so that could be a non-recurring item. On the asset back program, the accounts receivable, we use that when is it advantageous based upon cost of borrowing? Right, and that's really what the facility is there for, as opposed to, you know, like a revolver or commercial paper program, we're using a 364 day facility. So that goes in and out depending upon that advantageous interest rate. But you know, the overall cash story really was - we had a great fourth quarter, and we had some advance payments, we got paid, we got some non-recurrings, and we far exceeded what we thought we would achieve in fourth quarter. And as a result, some of what would have been in 2021 happened in 2020. And we tried to take you through that reversal. And then this you know, 10% to 15% growth that we expect next year, requires working capital. We\u2019re a capital light business model, but we still have working capital. And so when we grow just the difference between liabilities and assets, requires us to fund and that comes out of cash. I don t know Jim, do you want to add more color? Jim Reagan : Yeah. Just one thing on the - I think you use the same term, we do internally here, Gavin. And that's the recurring, non-recurrings. We can't forecast what they are, you know, there is a VirnetX issue out there, that could come as a bluebird tailwind. We just don't know when it will come. It could be a year, it could be two years. And so that's not in our forecast. The other is customer advance payments. We're two consecutive years now ending the year with previously on forecast, a big customer it advance payment balances, and we can forecast how we're working those off. But you know, that could also represent some upside to operating cash flow when we look at it this time next year. Gavin Parsons : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe if I can just try Cai\u2019s question on the COVID impact. Again, just I think you'd been guiding for something like a $500 million headwind in 2020, including both the direct impact to delayed starts and ramps, something on contract growth that didn't materialize. And obviously, that sets up a pretty easy comp in the back three quarters of the year. So just curious, just you know, growth guidance assumes that you recoup most of that, or if you - I know, you said you've taken a conservative approach, but just curious how much of that you assume you actually recover in 2021 versus beyond? Thanks. James Reagan : Yeah, I think that our view is that and baked into our guidances, that there's probably about $150 million of that, $150 million, $160 million that is still un-recovered and really in effect, pushing more to the right. So, you know, while there might be customer requirements that push into 2021, there's still going to be more movement of more work to the right. And that's what's implicit in how we're thinking about this. Gavin Parsons : Thank you. James Reagan : Sure. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. Now I'll hand the floor back to Peter Berl for closing remarks. Peter Berl : Great. Thank you, Rob. And thank you all for your time this morning and for your interest in Leidos. We look forward to updating you again soon. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Peter Berl of Investor Relations. Peter, you may begin. Peter Berl : Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to welcome you to our first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of the Leidos management team. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter ending April 2, 2021. Roger will lead off the call with notable highlights from the quarter, as well as comments on the market environment and our Company's strategy. Jim will follow with a discussion of our financial performance and our guidance expectations. After these remarks from Roger and Jim, we\u2019ll open the call for your questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific Risk Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, during the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in the press release that we issued this morning and is also available in the presentation slides. The press release and presentation, as well as a supplementary financial information file are provided on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.leidos.com. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Roger Krone. Roger Krone : Thank you Peter, and thank you all, for joining us this morning for our first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. As we communicated in our press release this morning, I'm pleased to announce that Chris Cage will be Leidos' next chief financial officer later this year. Chris will succeed Jim Reagan who has chosen to retire following a long and distinguished career, in particular, the last six years as my good friend and business partner. I will have a few remarks on this transition before I hand the call over to Jim, but first let's jump into the quarter. First quarter results reflect the perseverance, focus, and tremendous execution of our employees and business partners. New quarterly record levels of revenue, non-GAAP EPS and backlog were achieved, and significant organic growth was delivered across all business segments. This early momentum favorably positions Leidos to deliver on our full-year financial commitments. Revenues for the quarter were $3.3 billion, up 14.7% from the prior year, and up 9% organically, underscoring our accelerated recovery from last year's pandemic headwinds and the early ramp of new business wins. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.7%, up 240 basis points compared to the prior year period reflects strong program performance and the resolution of the long-standing MSA legal matter, which together delivered 45% growth on non-GAAP EPS of $1.73 for the quarter. Net bookings of $3.8 billion resulted in a book-to-bill of 1.2 times and 1.3 times on a trailing 12-month basis. This increase, driven by success in both our Solutions and Health segments established a record backlog of $32.6 billion for a 13th consecutive quarter, providing greater clarity and confidence in near-term revenue growth expectations. I will now touch on a few of the major wins we received in the quarter that underpin our growth and backlog. In the Health segment the company was awarded a new prime contract to provide nonmedical counseling to military service members and their families through the Military & Family Life Counseling program known as MFLC. This important work will be conducted at approximately 100 U.S. military installations or nearby civilian communities. We currently estimate revenues will be approximately $1 billion over the potential seven-year life of the program. This new award is especially timely with May being mental health awareness month. Military members and their families experience unique stresses. These include fears for the safety of the service member and feeling anxious or overwhelmed by deployment related challenges and responsibilities. Nearly one in four active-duty service members show signs of a mental health condition. Children of service members are especially vulnerable. One third of children with a deployed parent have psychological challenges, such as depression, anxiety, and behavior disorders. Through our work on the MFLC program we provide confidential counseling to alleviate stresses and enhance military members and their families ability to cope with these challenges. Counselors aim to prevent the escalation of stress into harmful conditions. About a quarter of our employees are veterans, so this program is meaningful to us on many levels. Next, in the Civil segment, the company was awarded a prime contract by U.S. customs and border protection to provide multi-energy portal systems for nonintrusive inspection of commercial vehicles at land and sea ports of entry. Under the contract Leidos will integrate, deploy and train CBP staff to use its VACIS MEP with low-energy backscatter and high-energy transmission cargo inspection system. The multiple award IDIQ contract has a total value of $480 million and a five-year base period of performance and options up to 10 years if exercise. And in the Defense Solutions segment, the company was awarded a prime contract by the Naval Undersea Warfare Center to provide engineering, technical, and management services for the Naval Array Technical Support Center. Leidos will be responsible for production engineering, technical and logistics support of the U.S. Navy and foreign governments towed [ph] array assets. This single award IDIQ contract has a total estimated value of $149 million. Finally, the company was awarded contracts valued at $822 million if all options are exercised by U.S. National Security and Intelligence clients. Though the specific nature of many of these contracts is classified, they all encompass mission-critical services that help to counter global threats and strengthen national security. Turning now to several notable accomplishments and events that took place in the quarter. We closed the 1901 Group acquisition in January and as anticipated the business is being levered across all of our business segments in both the performance of backlog programs and new program bids. The inclusion of 1901 Group's cloud based solutions and fully integrated service delivery platform will enhance performance on our customers important missions and continue to differentiate Leidos' value proposition across our defense, intelligence, civil and health markets we serve. Furthermore, as we shared with you on the February call, the Gibbs & Cox acquisition is nearing completion with yesterday's expiration of the HSR waiting period. With that gate cleared, we now expect the deal to close later in this month. Also, I want to take a moment to highlight the ongoing significant progress with the DoD Healthcare Management Systems Modernization program, otherwise known as DHMSM. The MHS GENESIS electronic health record system is now 30% deployed and is currently live and operational at more than 42 military treatment facility commands across the country with nearly 41,000 active users. Notably, during this unprecedented global healthcare crisis, this system has provided advanced capabilities to support clinicians and advice and providers including 24 x 7 access to medical and dental records and effectively tracking COVID-19 cases and mass vaccinations. Since its initial award, the program has been expanded to include the United States Coast Guard and the National Guard and Reserve. We remain on schedule to deliver MHS GENESIS by the end of calendar year 2023. Shifting to the macro environment, while we are still awaiting the release of the President's 2022 Detailed Budget Request and subsequent multiyear defense projections, we are encouraged by last month's release of the high level budget request. While the recommended defense funding level was in line with our expectations, our innovative technology and strategic investments remained squarely aligned with the administration's prioritization of certain critical need areas, such as digital modernization, cybersecurity, autonomy, and hypersonics. Additionally, we are very pleased with the proposed 16% increase in nondefense discretionary funding. This proposed growth supports the value proposition of our diverse business portfolio, which extends beyond defense and intelligence into the federal health and civil markets, including ports, borders and airport security. And while a continuing resolution in the fall is feeling like a near certainty, the typical annual disruptions may be muted given the no growth request for defense and the reality that under a CR, agencies generally continue to receive stopgap funding in line with prior years appropriation levels. With nearly $6 trillion of congressionally approved relief and stimulus funding since the start of the pandemic and a pending $2 trillion infrastructure request, we believe there could be additional opportunities for Leidos, particularly in our Civil segment. Areas of interest include airport and FAA upgrades, as well as civil agency research and development. However, we will need to see the final details when they become available to better understand what is truly addressable over the multiyear infrastructure plan. With regard to the administration's decision to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by early September, Leidos has been directed to leave the region within the same time line. We currently estimate the revenue impact to be less than 1% of our defense solutions segments current year revenue. While program level customer discussions are still evolving, our best estimates have been incorporated into the guidance that Jim will cover later in the call. As we recently marked the one year milestone of this devastating pandemic at the end of Q1, I want to provide you with another update on our Leidos Relief Foundation and how it has been assisting Leidos employees who have been impacted by the virus. Since March 2020, the fund has raised and distributed over $1.7 million through generous personal donations from employees, members of the executive team, and the Board of Directors, including company matched contributions. With those funds, over 500 Leidos families who have suffered a COVID-19 hardship or loss of a loved one have received financial assistance. The ongoing generosity of our colleagues is inspiring and a constant reminder of our share values no matter the challenge. Finally, as I noted at the top of the call, I will close my prepared remarks with a few comments on the upcoming CFO transition here at Leidos. On behalf of our Board of Directors and management team, I want to thank Jim for his countless contributions to this company and wish him all the best in his planned retirement. Jim joined us six years ago and has been my steadfast advisor and business partner. Jim and his team has grown the business over 160%, built an investment grade balance sheet and delivered significant total shareholder return. While Jim's contributions were critical in strategic planning and M&A deal structuring for key transactions, value creation takes place in successful business transformations and building and nurturing culture and talent, and that is where Jim made the biggest impact for our employees, our customers, and our shareholders. Thank you, Jim. However, I will save my goodbye since you'll be continuing to be an advisor through year-end. Meanwhile, I'm pleased to share that our Board of Directors has elected Chris Cage as our next Chief Financial Officer effective July 5 of this year, the beginning of our third quarter. Chris is a great example of the talent development and succession planning process here at Leidos. Chris joined the company in 1999 and many of you have had a chance to interact with him over the last several years as he has held a series of financial leadership roles with increasing responsibility, most recently as our Chief Accounting Officer. His financial experience and deep understanding of our business has prepared him and therefore our company for continued success. Since it is May 4, before I turn the call over to Jim, I just wanted to say May 4th be with you. I will now turn the call over to Jim Reagan for more details on our first quarter results and guidance. James Reagan : Thank you, Roger for those kind words and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. Upon reflection, I've had a very fulfilling career and these past six years here at Leidos have been truly special on account of all of the passionate and brilliant people who work here. I deeply value the relationships that we've built and the accomplishments that we have achieved together. I have great confidence in Chris's ability to lead the finance organization and I look forward to working with him on a seamless transition. With that, I'll start by providing an overview of our first quarter 2021 results, followed by an update to the 2021 guidance. We are pleased with our strong start and growth momentum through the first quarter of 2021. First quarter revenue grew 14.7% over the prior year quarter and 8.9% organically. The increase in revenue was driven by the Dynetics SD&A and 1901 Group acquisitions, growing on our existing -- growth on our existing programs and increased contribution from new programs. This solid start to the year aligns with our fourth quarter messaging and showcases our resilient program execution fundamentals with all segments delivering double-digit top line growth. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 11.7% grew 240 basis points over the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by program performance, mix and continued indirect cost management, as well as the benefit from the successful settlement of the MSA legal matter. Excluding the positive impact of this $26 million legal reserve adjustment, adjusted EBITDA margins would have been approximately 11%. First quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.73 grew $0.54 over the prior year quarter, driven by strong execution, and organic growth, as well as the settlement of the MSA legal matter. Without the settlement, non-GAAP diluted EPS would have been $1.59 reflecting 34% growth year-over-year. Operating cash flows for the quarter were $239 million. Excluding the net proceeds from the accounts receivable monetization facility, operating cash flows would have been approximately $145 million. The decision to utilize the facility enabled us to buy back approximately $100 million of Leidos stock on the open market during the quarter, which aligns with our long-term balanced capital allocation strategy, which consists of being appropriately levered and maintaining our investment grade rating, and returning a quarterly dividend to our shareholders, reinvesting for growth, both organically and inorganically and returning excess cash to shareholders in a tax efficient manner. Additionally, first quarter operating cash flow does not reflect any net cash benefit from the MSA settlement, which is expected to be realized in the second quarter. Bookings of $3.8 billion were strong across all segments, resulting in a 1.2 times consolidated book-to-bill and record ending backlog of $32.6 billion. This represents 15% growth in backlog from the first quarter of 2020. Now for an overview of our segment results. Defense Solutions revenue increased 14.8% year-over-year and 9.2% organically. Driving the strong growth was the Dynetics acquisition, the diligent execution of new programs, such as the CBP Traveler Processing and Vetting Software system and growth on existing programs. As a reminder, consistent with our policy, Dynetics revenue will now be included in our organic revenue calculation since we owned the business for a full year effective February 2021. Defense Solutions non-GAAP operating margins of 9.2% increased 240 basis points from the prior year period, reflecting strong program growth on certain contracts, reduced indirect expenditures and the recovery of a previously reserved international receivable. Defense Solutions booked nearly $2 billion in net awards for the quarter, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.0x and 1.3x on a trailing 12-month basis. In our Civil segment, revenues grew 17.1% from the prior year quarter and 6.1% organically. This growth was driven by the SD&A acquisition and volume growth on our existing programs. Non-GAAP operating margins in the Civil segment grew 110 basis points year-over-year, driven by the net benefit from the MSA legal reserve adjustment, partially offset by lower margins on certain programs. Civil recorded approximately $700 million in net bookings for the quarter, resulting in a 0.9 times book-to-bill and 1.1 times on a trailing 12-month basis. And finally, turning to our Health segment. Health segment revenues increased 11.5% over the prior year quarter on both a gross and organic basis. This growth was driven by increased volumes on existing programs, including the continued backlog burn down in our medical exam business and timing of wave deployments on the DHMSM contract. Health segment non-GAAP operating margins were strong at 18.6%, an increase of 310 basis points over the prior year quarter, reflecting increased volume and growth on programs with our VA and DoD customers, and reduced business investments only a commercial IT venture. We expect elevated levels of non-GAAP operating margin to continue through the first half of 2021 and return to normalized segment levels starting in the third quarter. The Health segment booked over $1.2 billion net awards driven by the successful win of the Military & Family Life Counseling contract, which resulted in a book-to-bill of 2.1 times for the quarter and 1.6 on a trailing 12-month basis. Before I turn to guidance, I want to give you a quick update on the $7.7 billion Navy Engine program. Transition and onboarding are going well, but due to the late fourth quarter resolution in the courts, the pace of the ramp was lighter than the first quarter. We expect the ramp to pick up considerably over the next two quarters, giving us confidence in the organic contribution in both this year and next, as outlined in last quarter's earnings call. Moving now to the remainder of the year. We are increasing our guidance for adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP EPS, and operating cash flow to account for two distinct items, the settlement of the MSA legal matter, and reduced share count resulting from our share repurchase during the quarter. Our guidance does not reflect the announced acquisition of Gibbs & Cox. As we've done in the past, we will provide an update in our next quarterly earnings call after the deal has closed. Our guidance range for revenue remains unchanged. We expect to deliver between $13.7 billion and $14.1 billion revenue for the year. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins for the year between 10.5% and 10.7%, a 20 basis point increase at the midpoint, from the previous guidance, reflecting the benefit from the MSA legal matter. As a result of the $100 million share repurchase executed in the first quarter and the net gain from the MSA legal matter, we are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.20 to a range of $6.35 to $6.65 on the basis of 143 million shares outstanding. And finally, to account for the expected net proceeds from the MSA legal matter, we are increasing our operating cash flow guidance by $25 million to at or above $875 million for the year. This updated guidance assumes no full year contribution from the accounts receivable monetization facility. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob so we can take some questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you very much. Good morning, Roger and Jim congratulations on your retirement. James Reagan : Good morning, Sheila. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning. Maybe just because you spent a few minutes on your prepared remarks talking about this Roger, and obviously there's an acquisition this morning from one of your competitors, can you talk about your Health Division? How do you expect revenue growth to kind of work through within some 30% implemented at the moment or deployed? And just bigger picture in terms of the Health market, how do you see it evolving, whether the growth or just competitive nature of it? Roger Krone : Well, let's see, on DHMSM we will be at our current revenue level or higher for another couple years. And Sheila, as you know, our Health Group has traditionally been our highest margin and our highest growth area and it's not surprising to us that others have seen the market as attractive as we have. And the interesting thing about the Health market is, it's always been highly competitive, and whether it's one of our competitors getting into one of our traditional businesses, it's just changing the name of the competitor. And it is a very much a commercial world and now we see the Biden Administration, maybe the Human Infrastructure Bill as it comes to pass, is continuing to increase the spend. And we think it raises the importance of agencies like CMS and Social Security. And that's going to attract maybe some new competitors and maybe some non-traditional competitors which in our strategic view of the market, we have always expected. And we believe we are successful in that market because we offer value added service to our customers and we are if you will sharpening our tools and getting ready for what we think will be a significant growth in the top line in the market overall. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Robert Spingarn : Hi good morning, and congrats Jim, best wishes ahead. James Reagan : Thanks Rob. Robert Spingarn : On the defense margins, they were sequentially up and above the level you had achieved previously in any quarter last year. So, I wanted to talk a little bit more about the drivers, you did touch on them, you talked about mix, et cetera, but and just whether COVID related margin pressure is easing there and if you can quantify the impact of the international receivable there? Roger Krone : Yes, just starting with the last one, think of the recovery on the international receivable is $2 million or $3 million or so. I think more fundamentally the businesses performed well on execution basis. Companies with portfolios of our size always have a program or two that are not making their planned margins, but the execution in the Defense Group has been going pretty well, including the strong management of indirect costs, which has also been something that's provided them with a lift. Now that said, we do have an R&D budget that we under spent a bit in the fourth quarter and we expect that the level of R&D spending to tick up a bit through the balance of the year. And that's important for our long-term strategic priorities that are going to grow the business at strong levels going forward. Last thing that I would say is that there's -- as we think about the margin in defense for the rest of the year, it's going to continue to be strong, but I don't think you should necessarily be thinking of the Q1 level as being something you'll see every quarter for the rest of the year. Robert Spingarn : Jim, is that the case in all the segments you touched on this earlier that the second half is just a little bit lighter because the first quarter or first half was elevated, is that all three segments? James Reagan : Well, you know, in Health we've got the backlog burn down that we talked about that because of the way the operating leverage in that segment works, the margins are going to be a little higher than normal through the second quarter of the year. Those margins will damp down a bit in the backend. But unless we find that healthcare costs are lower than we expect and if we find that our ability to generate proposals is more efficient somehow than we are currently modeling, I think that you could expect the margins to be a little bit lower in the back end of the year and that is across the board, yes. Robert Spingarn : Yes. Thank you very much. James Reagan : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you very much. So, could you comment a little bit on the burn off of the backlog of the medical exams in the Health area and what that means going forward? And then somewhat relatedly, Roger, you talk of the 16% increase in FY '22 Fed Civil budget. Talk about the opportunities you see there? Thanks so much. Roger Krone : Yes, let me start with the backlog. So, just for everyone on the line, we do medical exams for those people who are looking for disability benefits. Our largest customer is the VA, but we do them across the board. And during COVID there was a period of time we were shut down and a period time that our efficiency was diminished because of social distancing, and so there was a inventory or backlog of people who want these exams. And it grew up pretty much through last year to really for us, an all time high. Our commitment has been to work literally nights and weekends to over staff our clinics to work off the backlog. And we're benefiting in this quarter by that although we did have some weather in Texas and other states that damped our quarter down just a little bit. But we think it will take us into the third quarter before we get back to our normal run rate. That's our best estimate today Cai and we look at that level. The team looks at it every day. I look at it. Jim and I look at it on a weekly basis. We look at it by region and by type of exam. But we're making good progress. The backlog is significant and we think it's probably going to affect third quarter as well. And this is all positive by way as it was severely negative a year ago and we talked through that a year ago. As we think about the increase in the budget and about all we know at this point Cai, is what agencies look like they're getting the increase and we are all waiting for the PB to come out. But it does look like these are agencies for which we have a significant presence and significant heritage contract. So, it's civil infrastructure, it's also some health. I mentioned in my prepared remarks there's going to be ports and borders and airports, FAA infrastructure, those seem to be prime. There's probably going to be some roads and bridges, which is not really all that relevant to us. We think there may be some smart cities, smart highways, and we do have some contracts with the Department of Transportation, so we may benefit there. But the details are yet to be revealed and when we are on the call next quarter we will have the budget and we will be able to address those better then, but thanks for your question Cai. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Gavin Parsons with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Gavin Parsons : Hey, good morning. Roger Krone : Good morning. James Reagan : Good morning, Gavin. Gavin Parsons : Congrats to both Jim and Chris. James Reagan : Thank you. Gavin Parsons : I wanted to follow up just a bit on Cai's question there. That 16% initial request number, often that gets revised, but it does seem like there is more appetite in DC for raising non-defense budgets, may be there had been for the last two years. So, I just -- what are your thoughts on kind of weather that growth rate in the mid-teens or even double-digits is actually realistic and what the request messages for the multiyear defense budget outlook? Roger Krone : Yes, Gavin it's really hard to handicap the most watched sport in the national capital region which is our political process. Yes, I think they're going to go to conference. I don't think they're going to try reconciliation, but they could. And if central mansion [ph] from West Virginia, who has some influence, I think they'll come down a little bit and defense may go up. There are some politicians that we talked to who say it's, assume it's sequester and it's a tit for tat. So, if you're going to take Civil up, you have to take Defense up. I don't think that's exactly where we're going to land. I think we're probably going to have higher growth number on Civil than Defense. And by the way the Defense number, depending upon where you call it, 704, 715 or 753, does include the pay raise and now all go [ph] in the base budget. So if you look at it from that standpoint, the overall you could say has some downward pressure. The areas that we compete we view as just generally flat. We are though, I think when the dust settles and we get through this year and we get a bill, are expecting maybe high single or low double-digit increase on the Civil side. And that's going to benefit our Health and our Civil Group. We've already, as you would expect, put teams together to try to anticipate where those funds are going to be spent and to make sure that we're doing the prep work to get ready to provide customers value on programs that they're going to come forward with. We actually think cybersecurity is a good area for us. We think DHS is what's called the CISA which is their cybersecurity office which tends to deal with cybersecurity in the dotcom space. We expect them both to get money in the base bill and money in the infrastructure bill. So, cybersecurity overall looks like a good place to be. Thanks Gavin. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Tobey Sommer : Thank you. Over the last handful of years or so customers have been a little bit more willing to contract using different methods that end up being more profitable for service providers. What's your expectation for sort of a flattening of the defense budgets, meaning for the ability of that trend to continue in yield, good profit margins for the space? Roger Krone : Yes. Tobey let me see if I can address your comment and then I will let Jim add is, we tend to perform better when the contract is either fixed price or time and materials, where frankly the risk of performance is on us and then we can invest in, you know we can put in RPAs or something to drive more efficiency in the contract. We have something we call our cost based contract. You know, we are kind of limited on the earnings potential based upon the fee that we bid on the contract. And with fixed price we again -- we are almost immediately rewarded for technology innovation on the contract. It's always hard to call trends and I'm not sure we've seen, because not all of the officials have even been confirmed on the Biden Administration. I wouldn't say that we have seen a trend away from T&M. When you started, I thought you are going to talk about OTAs and I would simply say OTAs are alive and well and I don't see that changing. And maybe this is wishful thinking. Yes, I would like to see the customers go to more fixed price because I think it's fixed their cost, so they don't have to worry about year-over-year plus outs and it gives us performance responsibility and then the ability to earn more over the life of the program if we can drive efficiencies into the contract. I don\u2019t know, Jim, anything you want to add? James Reagan : Yes, just to pile on that, that also delivers a benefit for the customer because when we have more latitude in how to deliver a solution as opposed to something that's prescribed in a cost type contract, it allows us to help the customer save some money too. Tobey Sommer : And if you could just provide a little bit more commentary and color on the relative size of the opportunities within the infrastructure space, I think in your prepared remarks you mentioned airports as well as research? Thanks. Roger Krone : Yes, let's see, I think it's too premature to give you a number. But for instance when I said research, we are safer, healthier, and more efficient through IT, engineering, and science. And a lot of people have forgotten about our science work. And so, we run the National Cancer Lab for NCI as part of HHS. We also run the National Energy Lab up in Pittsburgh for the Department of Energy and that's another great program where -- and we do essentially early stage 62 [ph] kind of R&D and we expect certainly the Energy Lab in Pittsburgh where in the last administration we did a lot of work around coal and how we can burn coal cleaner and more efficient. We would expect this administration will spend a lot of money on renewable. And we see the charter and the work in the National Energy Technology Lab really growing as we think about wind and solar and hydro, and so that will grow. And then there are a lot of other places, we do work on the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and really across the board we do some work for the Army up in Fort Detrick, in the medical field. And so, we don\u2019t talk a lot about it because there's not a big contract like Navy NextGen in our science work. But our heritage of doing early stage scientific work is alive and well and of course as everyone knows we were founded as the science application company. And so we still have a fair amount of business in that early stage work. Tobey Sommer : I appreciate that. Thank you. Roger Krone : Yes. James Reagan : Thanks Tobey. Operator : Next question is coming from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Joseph DeNardi : Oh thanks. Good morning. James Reagan : Hi good morning. Joseph DeNardi : Good morning. Roger, just on the SDA business, I think the expectation when you all bought it was that, it would be about $500 million of sales and grow at 10%, it looks like you're running about $300 million now. Where do you expect that run rate to be by the end of this year? And then what are you all looking for on the infrastructure side to kind of give you clarity on what incremental opportunity that could provide for that business? Roger Krone : Let's see, we obviously don't guide by below -- we don\u2019t guide by segment much less by program and so we're not going to do that now. We have said that the SDA business overall has been impacted by COVID and there is less airport traffic and so that's affected the business. And more so overseas, where funding is tied to the ticket surcharges. So, we are going to be below our business case when we bought the L3 business for this year. That being said, in the U.S., we continue to see strong activity by TSA and Customs and Border patrol in buying equipment, because in the U.S. the purchasing dollars are really not tied to volume, they're tied to the Federal budget. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we got an award on VACIS. We had gotten an award on rail at the border. We are bidding on upgrading, adding something called CT at the check point at major airports. We actually have a prototype in demo at Dallas. If you come and visit us you will likely, well if you leave from here you will go through our CT at the checkpoint scanner at Dallas Airport. And we would expect some of the infrastructure dollars out of the Stimulus Bill to be spent on ports and borders, maybe some on airport and we're already working at those opportunities. I'll also tell you that really country by country, you know some countries are down. There are other country opportunities that have popped up that were not in our plan. So, it's always a mixed bag, but if you were to walk away from the call, I want everyone to know that the pandemic still has affected the SD&A business and where we might have expected we'd be fully recovered at the end of this year or into next year. We think it's probably the end of '22, beginning of '23 before we're back to normal volume. Joseph DeNardi : That's helpful. And then Jim, a lot of focus on cash flow obviously last quarter. I'm wondering if you could just provide some perspective on the updated guidance for this year of $875 million, is that a level of operating cash that you can grow off of in 2022? If not, what are some of the headwinds you face there? Thank you. James Reagan : Yes, absolutely. The change in the guide is really as I said in the prepared remarks, the result of the expected cash coming in from the MSA settlement. We clearly believe that we should be moving back toward a conversion rate of about 100%. The headwinds for this year really are the reversal of all the tailwinds we had last year. And going forward into '22 the only real change in conversion would be because of significant growth that will require the funding of working capital for receivables and you know, think of that as being roughly, the net amount of that, net of payables is about 27 days of sales is kind of the net working capital metric that we model based on. Joseph DeNardi : Okay it would be that working capital plus the payroll tax, those would be the two primary headwinds in '22? James Reagan : Yes, that is right. Joseph DeNardi : Okay, thank you very much. James Reagan : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much and good morning and congratulations Jim. I just wanted to ask about the Civil segment and so, if we back out the legal settlement there, the profitability was a little bit lower than what we're used to seeing, and sort of what drove that and you expected to kind of move back into that sort of low double-digit range in Q2 that we saw last year? James Reagan : Yes, historically the Civil segment has had a little bit more volatility in its operating income margin number, primarily as a result of the timing of delivery of product out of the security products business and this year will be no exception to that. We have some orders that are in the pipe that are being built, probably you will see those ship in the second half of the year and you can probably see volatility on the other end for that, that's what our forecast is telling us. Seth Seifman : Okay, I will just stick to one. Thank very much. James Reagan : All right. Thank you, Seth. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Mariana Perez Mora with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Mariana Perez Mora : Good morning everyone and congratulations to Jim and Chris. James Reagan : Thank you very much. Roger Krone : Good morning, Mariana. Mariana Perez Mora : So, my question is on SD&A. Yesterday [indiscernible] announced they expect awards from the TSA to expand the deployment of checked baggage screening equipment to all federally managed airports nationwide. Can you please describe what was light or small on that contract and also like discuss competitive dynamics on that business? Roger Krone : Yes, Mariana, it is a great question. The contracts that you are bringing up, we did not bid on it. That is a -- that's a contract to support the maintenance of the checked baggage screening machines. And we chose to really pursue a path of bidding on the larger contract, which is checkpoint equipment of all kinds, whether it's the screening machines or scanners or trace detection equipment. And we were concerned that to try to bid both of them could compromise our ability to get the bigger prize which is the one we're pursuing and you should hear about it sometime this month. Mariana Perez Mora : And how is competitive dynamics there for the main competitors and how has that over the last year? Roger Krone : Well, we currently hold what I think is the largest contract for the maintenance of the checkpoint screening equipment and while the TSA has divided that up, we have consistently gotten good performance ratings and we think that we're well positioned to win a big piece of that work later this month. Mariana Perez Mora : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question is coming from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. David Strauss : Thanks, good morning. I wanted to if you could provide an update on dynamics. It looks like the revenue run rate there just based on disclosure around the acquired revenue was a little bit lower, is that just seasonality? And then anything you can say with regard to the lunar-lander and the protest there? Thanks. Roger Krone : Well see, I'll start off and let Jim kind of catch you up on numbers. First of all on the Dynetics integration the team is going really well. You know there growth on a standalone basis is really eye watering. And we've integrated our Leidos Innovation Center into Dynetics to better cross fertilize our technology with their technology and that has really created a lot of excitement and we will see dividends of that in quarters to come. But performance at Dynetics is really solid and they continue to win programs in their relevant area and our hypersonic glide body facility is up and running. I was down there two weeks ago, three weeks ago, it's going classified. We actually have parts that we're building and really across the board Dynetics is going well. I will give you a little bit of insight on HLS. I can't give you much. So there were three bidders two of which everybody in the country knows and us, and the contract was given to SpaceX and upon our debrief and our review we felt that things needed a closer look, and so we did file a protest, and I'm not going to disclose a lot of what's in our protest. There is some stuff out on the web. There was a good article written out of the Washington Post that I would refer you to and I would also caution that the Washington Post is owned by one of the companies that was a competitor, but I still thought that the article was very thoughtful and is a good basis of trying to understand what's going on in the HLS program. And because our protest is really sort of and it's not quite a lawsuit, but it is certainly a dispute with a customer, I'd just rather not comment at length on our protest, but they typically last about 99 days and so in a couple months we will see what comes out of the HLS program. James Reagan : Yes, and in terms of the numbers, it is our policy that we don't include pro forma pre-acquisition revenues in calculating our growth rate. And so we didn't include strong growth that Dynetics had on a standalone basis last year in our growth numbers. Now that it's -- we had it for a year. We are including it and we do expect that as it is a part of the Defense Solutions segment, we expect that to show some continued growth into 2022 and 2023. Roger Krone : Hey Jim, I think the question may be around, you know we break it out in page 14 of our calculation in the back, but after 12 months we break it off and so what you're seeing, $83 million number, yes, the 83, that's a sub period. So you don\u2019t, you should not think of that as being the Q1 revenue from Dynetics and so I think Dave, what you might be seeing is just a partial period there and it might be misleading here to think that the revenue is down in Dynetics when in fact Dynetics is still continuing to performance well. James Reagan : Yes maybe to close at the end of January a year ago, so that's\u2026 Roger Krone : Early February. James Reagan : Yes. David Strauss : Yes, I was just comparing $83 million for one month versus kind of what you're -- had been your $300 million quarterly run rate the last couple of quarters. James Reagan : Yes, I think that's just a little, it's just a timing thing, yes for sure. David Strauss : All right, thanks very much. James Reagan : Yes, okay thanks. Roger Krone : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I will turn the floor back to Peter Berl for closing remarks. Peter Berl : Great, thank you Rob, and thank you all for your time his morning and for your interest in Leidos. We look forward to updating you again soon. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Stuart Davis, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Stuart Davis : Thank you, Hector, and good morning, everyone. I would like to welcome you to our second quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; and Chris Cage, our Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you will also find the earnings release and presentation slides that we will use during today\u2019s call. Turning to Slide 2 of the presentation. Today\u2019s discussion contains Forward-Looking Statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, as shown on Slide 3, during the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures a reconciliation between the two is included in today\u2019s press release and presentation slides. With that, I will turn the call over to Roger Krone, who will begin on Slide 4. Roger Krone : Thank you Stuart and thank you all for joining us this morning for our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Our results in the second quarter reflect our leadership position in the government technology market. I\u2019m tremendously proud of the way Leidos has responded throughout the pandemic as our employees and business partners continually delivered for our customers and shareholders. While we remain vigilant with the recent uptick in COVID-19 cases, Leidos is stronger than ever, with new quarterly record levels of revenue and backlog, consistent with our industry-leading organic growth. As I look at the quarter, four messages stand out. First, our strong financial results demonstrate that our strategy is working. Second, our business development momentum is setting the stage for future growth. Third, we are effectively deploying capital to broaden our offerings in attractive markets. And fourth, we are building an engaged and effective workforce. I will now drill down on each of these four key messages. Number 1, our strong financial performance was highlighted by double-digit organic growth and adjusted EBITDA margins above our long-term target. Revenue for the quarter were $3.45 billion up 18% from the prior year on a total basis and up 16% organically. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 10.4% were in line with guidance and above the long-term target we established two years ago. After adjusting for the one-time gain in the second quarter of 2020, non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 37%. These results didn\u2019t just happen rather they are a direct result of our strategy. We have differentiated ourselves within the market through scale, which creates a more competitive cost structure and expanded capability to take share and position in vital markets. We have also leveraged our cost structure to make key technology investments, which further separates us from our peers. Number 2, our business development engine continued the momentum that is driving our industry-leading organic growth. We achieved net bookings of $3.8 billion in the quarter, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1. Our 14th consecutive quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of one or greater. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio is now 1.2. As a result, total backlog at the end of the quarter stood at a record $3 billion, which was up 9% on a year-over-year basis. In our Health segment, we were awarded a new fixed-price contract with a ceiling value of almost $1 billion to improve the health of military service before, during and after deployment. Under this contract, known as the Reserve Health Readiness Program, or RHRP. We will provide physical, mental health and dental assessments along with laboratory and diagnostic services supported by a secure IT infrastructure and customer service call center. America\u2019s more than one million reserve component personnel stand ready to support and defend our nation when it is called upon. It is our honor to support them. In our Defense Solutions segment, the Transportation Security Administration awarded us a $470 million prime contract to integrate transportation screening equipment at airports all around the country. Based on our policy, we only booked a small initial task order in the quarter, although we expect to achieve the full value over the life of the contract. This work is a reconfiguration of work we have been performing for over 12-years. And we also maintain screening equipment for TSA at all U.S. federalized airports, helping TSA ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce as one of the core ways Leidos is making the world safer, healthier and more efficient. In our Civil segment, the Federal Aviation Administration notified us that they have given us initial tasking as part of a long-term extension for the continued systems integration sustainment and enhancement of the En Route Automation Modernization, or ERAM system. The ERAM system is critical for operations in the national aerospace system and at the 20 air route traffic control centers in the Continental U.S. We didn\u2019t book anywhere close to the $6.8 billion ceiling value, but it speaks to the confidence that the FAA has in Leidos. We expect to begin the 2022 government fiscal year with a continuing resolution, but customers will still be able to fund work in critical needs areas. Our positive outlook is bolstered by the level of proposal activity. At the end of the quarter, we had $49 billion in submits outstanding of which $35 billion is new work for us. Number 3, we are deploying capital to complete our offerings in attractive markets to spur profitable growth. In May, we completed the acquisition of Gibbs & Cox, which brings us world-class naval architecture design and engineering. They design 68% of the Navy\u2019s current surface combatant fleet and are truly a national asset. This deal enhances how we are viewed across the Navy and opens up significant market opportunity for us. Our strategic planning process had identified maritime as an attractive market where we were underpenetrated. To enable synergies, especially around unmanned surface and subsurface systems, Gibbs & Cox will be combined with Leidos\u2019 Maritime Systems division and operate under Dynetics within the Defense Solutions segment. In addition, we are seeing early returns from our 1901 Group acquisition, which we closed in January of this year. Most directly, 1901 is providing significant support to the NGEN program transition and operations. They have significantly expanded their workforce, growing the current enterprise IT operations center in Virginia and accelerate the establishment of new NGEN service desk locations in San Diego, Norfook and Boise. 1901\u2019s platform delivered IT services made them the best choice for the program\u2019s requirements in this area. 1901 was also instrumental in securing a 125 million follow-on contract with the Bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives for managed IT services. 1901\u2019s strong customer relationships with the ATF, coupled with their efficient as-a-service delivery model, made them key to the bid and execution strategies. In addition to deploying capital to spurn growth, we were also committed to returning capital to shareholders. To that end, our Board just approved a 6% increase to the quarterly dividend. This increase reflects the confidence of the Board of Directors and the management team in the quality of our earnings and our ability to generate cash. Number 4. This is a people business, and this quarter offered further proof that we are an employer of choice that can attract the workforce needed to meet our financial commitments. During the quarter, we hired more than 4,500 people and at the end of the quarter, we were more than 42,000 strong. Our headcount grew 6% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. Our ability to attract top talent in this manner is important as we staff up to successfully execute the new programs. One of the reasons we are attractive to job applicants is that we invest in talent management and career development. We regularly review talent and plan development actions including rotations at all levels throughout the company. As an example, Executive Vice President, Jim Cantor, recently announced his intent to retire after his distinguished 31-year career at Leidos. This enabled us to reconfigure our team to optimize performance given our rapid growth and the changes in market priorities. I asked Vicki Schmanske who is leading our intelligence group to assume the new role of Executive Vice President, Corporate Operations. In her new role, Vicki will drive operational performance and implementation of strategic functional initiatives. Roy Stevens who led business development and strategy succeeded Vicki as the President of the Intelligence Group. In addition, I asked Chief Human Resources Officer, Paul Angola, to lead a strategic effort to chart our way forward in the national security space market. These changes will help us prepare for an uncertain future. A few weeks ago, we kicked off the $1 million move-the-needle sweepstakes to encourage our employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and Hasson are coming back together. At the time, all of our facilities were open and all vaccinated individuals were able to work without a mask. A lot has changed in the past weeks. The highly contagious delta variant and the infection trends are disturbing. As we have throughout the pandemic, we will comply with all CDC guidelines, and most of our facilities will require masks regardless of vaccination status. While we do not expect that our customers will be shutting down their offices again, we cannot be certain. In the face of that uncertainty, we have decided to keep our current forward guidance in place and Chris will walk you through that in more detail. For me, part of returning to normal is being able to get together face-to-face with our investors and analysts. It is our intent to host an Investor Day in New York on October 7th. We have a compelling story to tell, and we look forward to doing just that. We will closely watch for COVID protocols from New York City and update you if our plans change. Finally, Frank Kendall has stepped down from our Board to serve as the Secretary of the Air Force. I want to thank Frank for his service to Leidos and more importantly, to the Air Force, the Department of Defense and the nation. I will now turn the call over to Chris Cage. I\u2019m delighted to have Chris step up to the CFO role and join us on these calls. Christopher Cage : Thanks, Roger, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I have worked at Leidos for 23-years, and I have personally benefited from the forward-thinking developmental programs that Roger referenced earlier. My predecessor and Mentor, Jim Reagan, created a very strong team in set of processes and disciplines that I have had the opportunity to help shape over the last few years. Going forward, my initial areas of focus will be threefold : delivering on our financial commitments, integrating acquisitions and prioritizing spending on investments to execute our strategy. With that, let\u2019s jump right into the second quarter fiscal year 2021 results. Beginning with the income statement on Slide 5, I will first run through the financial results at the corporate level, then turn to the segment level to address the primary revenue and profitability drivers. As Roger said, the highlight of the quarter was our organic growth, which is truly unprecedented in our industry at our scale. Revenue quarter were $3.45 billion up 18% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding acquired revenues of $58 million, revenues increased 16% organically. Notably, revenues grew organically across all three reportable segments. The organic growth is somewhat inflated by the drop in the revenues last year as a result of the pandemic when for example, our VA disability exam business was almost entirely shutdown. Even if we add back the 132 million direct pandemic effect in the prior year, organic revenue growth was still 11%. Adjusted EBITDA was 359 million for the second quarter, which was up 5% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased from 11.8% to 10.4% over the same period. Excluding the VirnetX gain from the prior period, adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 140 basis points in the quarter. This was primarily due to strong program management, higher volumes on some fixed price programs and better direct labor utilization. Non-GAAP net income was 218 million for the second quarter, which was down 2% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.52, also down 2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. Excluding the impact of VirnetX gain from last year\u2019s results, non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 37%. Our effective tax rate on non-GAAP income in the quarter was 24% compared to the 22% we anticipated for fiscal year 2021, this negatively impacted non-GAAP diluted EPS by $0.04. The tax rate increase was primarily across our international business. The largest single driver was that in Q2, we recognized the full impact of a recently enacted increase in the U.K. corporate tax rate from 19% to 25%. Now for an overview of the segment results on Slide 6, Defense Solutions revenues increased by 14% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the acquisitions of 1901 Group and Gibbs & Cox, organic revenue was up 12%, primarily from ramping up recent contract wins such as NGEN and increased weapon systems development within Dynetics. Civil revenues increased 5% compared to the prior year quarter, with about half coming from the SD&A acquisition and half driven by increased demand on large programs such as Hanford site integration. Health revenues increased 62% compared to the prior year quarter, and all of that growth was organic. We had a large year-over-year increase on the DHMSM as well as a nice ramp on the new Military and Family Life Counseling program or MFLC. The largest increase, though, was in the VA disability examination business in our QTC subsidiary. Remember, this was the business hardest hit by the pandemic in the year-ago quarter and now volumes are higher than ever as we continue to work through the backlog of exams. On the margin front, Defense Solutions non-GAAP operating income margin for the quarter came in at 8.3%, which was up 20 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. Civil non-GAAP operating margin declined from 12.9% in the prior year quarter to 9.1% as we had fewer deliveries of our border and port security systems and airport screening systems. Finally, and most significantly, health non-GAAP operating income margin for the quarter was up to 17.8% compared to 5.3% in the prior year quarter. This quarter\u2019s strong margin performance benefited from the significantly increased revenue volume, but the year-over-year improvement was enabled by the strategic investments we made a year-ago to keep our workforce in place and ready to meet the coming customer demand. Turning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 7, operating cash flow for the quarter was 17 million and free cash flow, which is net of capital expenditures, was a usage of four million. During the second quarter, we settled the accounts receivable monetization program, which negatively affected our operating and free cash flow by $94 million. On a year-to-date basis, the AR monetization program is neutral to cash flow, and we do not plan to sell any more receivables. During the quarter, we used working capital to fund the start-up of new programs and the expansion of existing programs and drive strong organic growth. You can see this impact most clearly in the drawdown of advanced payments compared to last year. Cash generation from the business segments was right on plan for the first half of the year and actually ahead of last year. But that performance is overshadowed by one-time non-operational cash benefits in the first half of 2020. These include 225 million from the AR monetization program; 85 million from VirnetX; 48 million in CARES Act tax deferrals; and 103 million in lower cash taxes, which is just a timing issue. During the second quarter, we paid down 27 million of debt and returned 48 million to shareholders in quarterly dividends. As laid in Friday\u2019s 8-K, our Board of Directors approved a 6% increase in the dividend beginning in September. This is our first increase in two-years and reflects our confidence in the future outlook and commitment to shareholder returns. In addition, we paid net consideration of 376 million to acquire Gibbs & Cox, which positions us to provide a broad set of engineering solutions to the U.S. and international navies. Gibbs & Cox is contributing a little more than 100 million in revenues this year at margins above the Defense Solutions segment average, given its higher proportion of fixed price work. To finance the transaction, we borrowed 380 million with a one-year maturity at very attractive terms, no more than LIBOR plus 113 basis points. As of July 2, 2021, we had 338 million in cash and cash equivalents and 5.1 billion of debt. Last month, we established a commercial paper program for short-term liquidity management. Commercial paper will give us more flexibility at a lower cost than selling accounts receivables. Commercial paper is only available to us because our debt is investment grade, and we view our investment-grade rating as a strategic asset. Over the remainder of the year, our primary capital deployment priority will be debt pay down as we return to a normalized leverage ratio of three times. We remain committed to our long-term balanced capital deployment strategy, which consists of being appropriately levered and maintaining our investment-grade rating, returning a quarterly dividend to our shareholders reinvesting for growth, both organically and inorganically and returning excess cash to shareholders in a tax-efficient manner. On to the forward outlook. As shown on Slide 8, we are maintaining our guidance for fiscal year 2021, including revenue between 13.7 million and 14.1 billion, adjusted EBITDA margin between 10.5% and 10.7%; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $6.35 and $6.65; and operating cash flow at or above 875 million. As the year progresses, we normally tighten our guidance ranges, but there are a lot of forces at play, including worsening of the COVID situation with a more contagious Delta variant in stagnation in vaccination rates as well as ongoing challenges in the global supply chain, especially around computer chips. On revenues, NGEN is ramping well, but this is still a new customer and new contract. So we don\u2019t want to have an established history of order flow and don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves. The Intelligence Community award decisions have slowed noticeably, and we are also incrementally more cautious on the bounce back of the international airport screening market. So we are not forecasting a return to growth there until 2023. The Gibbs & Cox acquisition should keep us comfortably in our revenue range, but it likely won\u2019t put us above the range. We expect revenue to grow fairly linearly through the back half of the year from Q2 levels. Growth drivers in the third and fourth quarters include the full contribution of Gibbs & Cox, the continued ramp on NGEN, MFC and several other programs. Towards the end of the year, we expect the VA medical exams will begin to return to their pre-pandemic levels. On EBITDA margins, year-to-date performance in the second quarter was 11.1% to land in the guidance range for the year, adjusted EBITDA margin for the back half of the year will be around the same level as this quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS will generally follow revenue and margin. However, we are now forecasting the FY 2021 tax rate to be between 23% and 23.5% instead of our original 22% forecast, which slightly outweighs the accretion from Gibbs & Cox. In addition to the international tax headwinds I mentioned earlier, we are now forecasting a lower deduction for share-based compensation based on stock price performance over the first half of the year. Finally, we expect cash flow to follow our normal pattern and accelerate in the back half of the year to land us at the guided level. Over the past five-years, we have generated an average of 65% annual operating cash flow in the third and fourth quarters. That pattern will be slightly more pronounced this year as a result of the working capital that we have devoted in the first half of this year to drive 17% year-over-year growth. We have a detailed execution plan to achieve our operating cash flow guidance. And with that, I will turn the call over to Hector so we can take some questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sheila Kayaglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Hi good morning Roger. And welcome, Chris. Thank you both. So maybe, Roger, if you could comment on your Intel business, how large is it? And you mentioned some delays there, Booz I think, was down mid-single digits in the quarter. So maybe what is going on with the Intel customer specifically and what sort of delays are you seeing? Roger Krone : Well, it is a little bit larger than two billion. And of course, it is in our Defense Solutions segment, so we don\u2019t really spike it out. The good news for us is, after the quarter, we did win a recompete which is below one billion. But what we have seen overall is it just has taken them longer to get through their acquisition process and awards, recompetes, new business that we had put in our plan have taken literally months or quarters to come to fruition. And what that has meant for us and for others in the industry rather than booking a full increment of a recompete, we are getting shorter extensions. And so it is not really contributing to the increase in backlog. But in the last quarter or two, we really haven\u2019t lost a significant amount of business. It has just been like a lot of things in COVID, things have just been moving to the right. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay and then maybe one quick one on margins. You guys did really well with first half margins up 11% - I\u2019m sorry, 11% EBITDA margins, and your implied guidance is 10%. Is this like the start of Chris\u2019 conservatism or is that maybe mostly due to the civil margin impact because that looked like it was down in the quarter, and I think you mentioned due to the security business. Christopher Cage : Sheila, this is Chris. Thank you. And no pattern of conservatism here, but we laid out some reasons to be cautious, right. And so there are some unknowns. Last year with COVID, things whipsawed a little bit. So with Delta variant, we are being conservative there. We laid out for Civil, of course, we are expecting some uplift overtime from the security products business and not just the aviation side, but the ports and borders, which that business has performed very well for us on a legacy basis. So there are some puts and takes. We are still intending to increase our level of investment on research and development. We built that into our plan all year long and so some of that is programmed in for the back half of the year, but we want to make sure that we can deliver on these commitments. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Robert Spingarn : So Roger, maybe Chris, you talked about your attention to the top-line guidance a couple of times here so far, but there are a bunch of moving pieces. And I was wondering if we could size some of this. Would it be right to characterize the naval architecture business is around I don\u2019t know, 80 million, 90 million a quarter. Christopher Cage : No. We would say maybe 100 for the half. So remember, that is about what we get. So it is about a half a year, call it, 100 million, maybe a little bit better than 100 million, and it is growing. But for the half that we will book rounded to 100 million. Robert Spingarn : Okay. And that is what you are thinking in terms of maybe offsetting downside from COVID? I know COVID is a tough discussion to begin with. But how are you thinking about that? Maybe another way to ask this, Roger, is have your organic growth targets changed since Q1 for the three segments? Roger Krone : Well, you know we are talking 139. Robert Spingarn : I\u2019m not just talking about that. Roger Krone : Yes. I mean not appreciably - hey Robin you and I think the other folks on call know where we were a year-ago, and we thought we made a reasonable change a year-ago. And we sort of walked into the second wave. And I think we all learned that this COVID thing is unpredictable. Throw on to that the shortage of computer chips and which - and we usually get a lot of material deliveries in the second half. And although we have seen some lengthening in the supply chain, we don\u2019t see any shortages yet. But you all have taught us a great lesson in the last 12-months. And I kind of like where we are. Yes, Gibbs & Cox gives us a little bit of lift. But there is a ton of uncertainty out there in the next six months. Christopher Cage : Yes, Robin, this is Chris. Just to add on to that. Obviously, we do detailed forecasts and ops reviews quarterly with all our business lines, and there is always movements, right, across the portfolio. Roger just talked about the Intel delays. And so that might have been a business area where some of the things that we put into the pipeline haven\u2019t come out yet. We were hopeful that some of those would and potentially give some uplift. None of those have been lost. But there is always small movements within the portfolio within $13.9 billion midpoint that we are driving towards and so the Gibbs & Cox piece potentially helps offset some of that or give us some capacity for downside risk given the COVID situation. Robert Spingarn : Okay. I guess what I\u2019m really looking for is because last year was so challenging, and this year, you are catching up a lot, and you have a lot of good businesses that are growing. I mean, this obviously is a high growth year. You are the highest grower in the sector, as we have discussed. Maybe high level, Roger, looking into the future, once things normalize, how do you see the growth patterns in the business? Roger Krone : Well, we still see a strong growth but not at the level that we have just demonstrated. At our investor meeting two-years ago, we kind of talked about five, right. And we will talk about that again in October. So clearly, we are comfortable with five. But what we have been doing over the last couple of quarters is really unprecedented, and I don\u2019t expect to paint another quarter like we did. Some of that certainly year-over-year is COVID recovery, but we have enjoyed a significant number of wins and a high percentage of our competes so we are still very bullish on our long-term growth prospects, but not at the double-digit level. Robert Spingarn : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Terrific. And so Roger, you won AEGIS, but it is under protest. Maybe update us on that. And on your larger outstanding bids, I believe they include in-play, UDS recompete and the 3.5 billion FAA award. Roger Krone : Okay, Cai, thanks and hey good morning. So we won the - it is a NASA bid about - in the order of 2.5 billion. It was protested by the incumbent as it seems everything is nowadays, NASA is taking corrective action. And so it is a little hard to forecast what the outcome will be. History has told us NASA takes corrective action, they make another award decision and then, of course, usually that is followed by another protest and those tend to last kind of 100 days. And so it may take them another three, four weeks to do their corrective action and then you tack another three-months on the back of that. So we suspect we will be talking about NASA ages through the third and fourth quarter, unfortunately. On DAS, it is a big contract up at DISA. We are hoping it will be a fourth quarter award. It could easily slide into first quarter. And I would suspect, Cai, that will be protested 1 way or the other. The UDS bid, which is at NGA, which is in the nominally four billion to five billion, a significantly large bid, we expected that to come out July and August. There are some other things going on at NGA, which is in the Intel group, Sheila\u2019s question, which may cause that to be delayed. It could happen in August, it could happen in September. Frankly, the acquisition team at NGA is really busy. And when they get around to clearing the award, they will make the award. We think it is third quarter, but these things become ever increasingly hard to forecast. But those are the big ones that are out there. There is some other things that are down in the one billion level. Cai von Rumohr : Great, thank you. And then if I could follow-up on Sheila\u2019s question about margin. It sounded like you went out of your way to remind people that your long-term target is 10%, it is not 10.4%. I guess as we just look at next year, I would assume health the margin has to be down because you don\u2019t have the VA catch-up. If you get AEGIS, that is below average so that I assume civil also would have downward pressure year-over-year. So is that calling out the 10% just to be conservative or is there a real concern that realistically, there is no way 10.5% is kind of anything you could do on a sustainable basis. Roger Krone : Go ahead, Chris. Christopher Cage : I\u2019m sorry, Roger. So Cai, Chris here, I just was going to jump in on that. So first of all, we were trying to send a signal about 2022 yet, right. That is what we will lay out when we get to Investor Day in October. But there is more going on to what you pointed out, and those are various due observations. Number one, Roger talked about 1901, the contribution that is making to our portfolio. And that would really be an enabler across not only the defense opportunities in enterprise IT, but also into the Civil segment and others to help us deliver those capabilities more cost effectively and drive margin uplift. So we see that as something that will help us there. Obviously, in the Civil segment, margin will ride up with the recovery in our security products business and not just the aviation side, but as I mentioned, ports and borders and there are opportunities, whether it is within the infrastructure bill or otherwise with our customers internationally for that line of business that we are very bullish on. So those things would help us lift margins in that area, and we do have to be prepared for health margins moderating back down a bit as the exam backlog works its way down. But again, that will still be a robust part of the portfolio on margins. So more to come in October, but I don\u2019t think you should read in that we are resetting to 10% longer term. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gavin Parsons with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Gavin Parsons : Hey good morning. Roger, I just wanted to clarify your organic growth comment in response to Rob\u2019s question. You said at the last Investor Day, you talked about 5%, you are comfortable with that. Without getting ahead of Investor Day targets, can you just clarify if you mean you think you can continue to grow 5% on a multiyear outlook? Roger Krone : I want to be absolutely clear. The long-term outlook that is out is what we gave at the investor conference, gosh, in May two-years ago, and we raised it from three to five, okay. We have done nothing to change that, okay. And that is what I was just trying to articulate to Rob. That being said, our organic growth, frankly, our total growth has been really remarkable. And our book-to-bill, it has just been great. I mean the team has done such a great job. I\u2019m not going to update the 5% until October. But I have tried to give reasons why there should be a lot of confidence at five or perhaps better. So Gavin, that is about as far as I can go. Gavin Parsons : Okay. No, that is great. I appreciate the clarification. I just wanted to make that clear. And then Chris, anything you could do to help us quantify the health care exam contribution that business is running 30% above 2019 levels, but obviously, you have some other growth drivers in there. So any sense of what maybe that business has grown versus 2019, excluding the lumpiness in exams? Christopher Cage : Yes. Gavin, I mean, as you can appreciate, there is some sensitivities on getting too far down into the portfolio competitively or otherwise on that. But that is not the only thing that is going on in health. That is the point we wanted to make. We have told you for a long time that the DHMSM program would be ramping up, it has. That team is performing exceptionally well. MFLC is really on a nice trajectory to ramp up, and those margins will be lower than other parts of the portfolio initially, but they will have an opportunity to increase overtime. And we have got zero contribution from RHRP in these numbers, right. So that will be something that we will look forward to next year to really ramp up as that program gets underway. So the exam business is above historical levels, but quite honestly, that team has delivered so well that the customer is looking to send more work our way overtime. And so we are prepared to accommodate them in their needs however possible. And so the hope is that we can continue that at a nice clip. Gavin Parsons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Akers : Hey good morning guys, thanks for the question. Could you kind of update what are your latest thoughts on the infrastructure bill in maybe areas where you could see a benefit from that? Roger Krone : Great question. Of course, we are hoping that there will be a rare show of bipartisan that looks like it is a $550 billion plus over what we would have seen. And there is a lot of focus on your roads and public transit and water systems. But we think broadband, airports, ports, waterways, security equipment. And then we think there is going to be emphasis on protecting the infrastructure and whether that be cyber security or grid hardening. That is right in our swim lane and then we are really excited about 5G and frankly, 5G really to everyone in the country. And we think that will spur sort of another big investment in IT and IT technology as the ability of all us the ability of all to function from an edge device. The phones that we have today are just the beginning. When we all have 5G, the functionality that you will carry in your pocket is going to increase by an order of magnitude. And that with cloud and as a service, we could see that as spurring a whole new round of investment and application, migration, so we are very bullish. Now I will caution everyone, it is our typical federal government authorized appropriate then it gets distributed to the agencies. They put plans together then they put out RFPs and they have industry days and we bid. And I don\u2019t want to sound too negative here, but it takes a long time for money like that to flow through the system to where we win contracts, we start performing, we turn it into revenue and then finally into cash and earnings. So it is all positive and it is positive for us, not only because of our Civil group, but really across the board and everything that we do in technology, it is going to be months or years away, but overall positive. Matthew Akers : Thanks and I think on the COVID in this latest wave, it sounds like that is a big driver kind of conservative guidance for the rest of the year. Are you seeing any signs from particular areas that maybe customers are considering closing down locations again or contracts getting delayed or anything that you are seeing there or just is that sort of just cautious in the guidance? Roger Krone : We haven\u2019t seen customers like we did when we were talking about 360 and the CARES Act and the Intel went to shift work. I will just what we all know, I mean, the President comes on national TV and talks about a mask mandate, we all stand up and listen. We are essentially going back to a mask mandate according to the CDC guidelines, and we will expect all of our customers to do that. A bigger concern for us is really what is going on outside of the U.S. And as you know, we have significant operations in Australia, the U.K., the Middle East. And they are hunkering down again. In Australia, not only is it difficult to get in the country, it is difficult to get around the country to go from Melbourne, to Canberra and to Sydney. And I think Chris addressed it well, but our SD&A business and certainly the part that we acquired is heavily dependent on international business, which is dependent upon tariffs on airline tickets and when the volume is down, the money is not there. And although we have not lost any significant competitions in the SD&A business, we have seen many, many canceled and delayed. So I think the impact for us will be in our Civil segment in the business that we refer to as security detection and automation. Matthew Akers : Got it, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Eric Ruden : Hi good morning. You actually have Eric Ruden on the line for Peter today. Maybe just a quick one for me. With a lot of the focus across many industries today being on rising input costs and labor being the lion\u2019s shares of yours. Are you seeing any pressure there, I know you mentioned the 4,500 new hires. So any color on how you are offsetting these headwinds in the current environment and then how much additional staffing is needed near-term? Roger Krone : Let\u2019s see. It is sort of a mixed answer. We refer to them as unicorns. So someone with a lifestyle polygraph, a security clearance and can program in a computer language called Python in a national capital region around D.C. Yes, we are seeing a lot of competition for that person. And in order to get the staff that we need, we have to compete, and that is driving up labor in those areas. In other areas, there is a lot of people available. We have been able to meet our hiring goals. And of course, as we have said on this call, we have a strategy to de-concentrate our work in the national capital region and move to areas of the country where the workforce is more readily available. Our 1901 acquisition, which I know we haven\u2019t talked a lot about, has a significant presence in Blacksburg, and a great relationship with Virginia Tech. And that was just one more reason why it was attractive to us, and it opens a new workforce for us. We have a software development center in Morgantown, at West Virginia University. We have one in Charlesville at UVA, and now we have one in Blacksburg. Overall, we are expecting to hire maybe a number that is in the 9,000 to 10,000 new and we are at the I think I said 4,500. We are a little bit better than that now, because of the Navy NextGen staffing, which has continued to go very, very well. And we have enjoyed what we call incumbent capture where people who are under contract with the prior contractor have elected to come to work at Leidos. So we are actually significantly above that number. And so we are on-track to meet our hiring goals but there is always that specific individual, you know a PhD and radiology that is difficult to find, especially if you are geographically limited as you often are in the Intel business. Eric Ruden : Okay. Thanks that is very helpful. That was the one for me. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Tobey Sommer : I was hoping you could speak to how you anticipate wage inflation, should it sort of materializing broadly impacting the business and when you described your answer, could you touch on the different contract types to the extent that, that could be informative? Roger Krone : Yes. Tobey, I will start and Chris can come in with some of the numbers. We have a portfolio mix, which is a little bit - it is almost 50/50. It is a little bit off from that, which is fixed price. And some of our fixed-price work is what we call time and materials, but think of that as fixed rate. Right. So it is so much per hour and the customer buys a number of hours. And then we have what we call our cost reimbursable or cost type contracts. And I will - let me start very simple and then I will see if I can address your question. Clearly, on the cost reimbursable work, if there is wage inflation, that essentially becomes a pass-through to the customer. And that is not as - maybe not quite as positive as it sounds because customers live on annual budgets. And if you are a NASA customer, you have X for a program in a given year, you don\u2019t have X plus inflation. And so if our wages increase inside a budget year, often the customer will have to decrease scope because they don\u2019t have any additional funds to execute the program. And then, of course, on fixed price, we have said, we will do a program or complete a task for a fixed dollar amount. And the therefore, rely on us to balance the cost per hour with the number of hours. And our challenge, and I think it will be the challenge across the industry, if we see significant wage inflation above what we estimate when we bid, then we are going to have to find new efficiencies in service and delivery to offset that inflation. We are always trying to do that. That is why sometimes on fixed-price programs, our profit margin might be a little bit better. And we will just have to do more of that. Part of the again, going back to our 1901 comment, the excitement about 1901 is it has an as-a-service platform, which is really independent on labor, so we charge so much for a service, and we use essentially application IT platform to deliver that. And there is a lot of opportunity for us to create new efficiencies through the service and delivery model. Christopher Cage : And Tobey, this is Chris. Just to add on to Roger\u2019s point, you hit most of the issues here. Every year, we do a detailed pricing build up - multiyear pricing buildup for our indirect and our direct labor costs and certainly contemplate some level of inflation as we build multiyear projections around that. If it turns out that wage inflation is outpacing what we have estimated, we have an opportunity to refresh that, which we will do, and we will build those costs in. And so you really are just - at any given time, you might win some contracts where you price them with the old rates. And to Roger\u2019s point, you have to find opportunities to drive efficiencies to protect margins. But on the future bids, we are pricing in what we think it requires to execute the work. So we are very transparent about that with our customers. And we have got good competitive Intel on where we think we need to be on a price to win. So all those factors play into how do we deliver, how do we win work and how do we maintain the margin profile that we are committing to you. Roger Krone : Yes. Tobey, one additional side. Just because I think it is a really thought-provoking question. One of the things that we have seen is as we mix more college hires and less experienced employees into the mix, what we call labor categories and their wrap rates, they make less. And we have been thrilled with the quality of our less experienced workforce and their ability to do the job. And that is another lever for us as we increase our college hiring to use more of that newly graduated workforce in key positions. Tobey Sommer : Thank you very much. And I wanted to get your perspective on continuing resolution and what sort of the data you might expect that to extend at this juncture? Roger Krone : Yes. I will be really quick. We want to get one or two more questions in. I think everyone does expect to see at the end of the fiscal year. I\u2019m not optimistic I don\u2019t think we will have a government shutdown. I think we will get through the debt ceiling limit. I don\u2019t know if there is any appetite for that in either side of the aisle. I would love to be optimistic and say we are going to get a bill before the end of the year, but I\u2019m not. I think we will run a CR through - into the first quarter. Just everything that seems to be going on, that would be my forecast. And what that will do is we all know is the work that is under contract will continue, new starts will get delayed. By way, new starts are getting delayed anyway. And as we have said again many, many times, I think, in like, what is it, 19 of the last 20-years, we have had a CR. So I don\u2019t see it as a big impact to our business. I would love to see a bill, but we are certainly able to handle a CR as long as it doesn\u2019t go past first quarter. Christopher Cage : Thanks, Tobey. Tobey Sommer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Joseph DeNardi : Maybe Roger or Chris, just following up on a prior question, enterprise IT has been a big focus for you all and obviously, a lot of success there with NGEN and now AEGIS. I can\u2019t imagine it would be such a focus if that work was dilutive to margins. So is there a rule of thumb, say, for a 10-year contract when that work becomes accretive? Is it right away? Does it take a few years? Is it not until the end of the contract? How does that work generally? Roger Krone : You mean accretive to our average margin or accretive to EPS? Joseph DeNardi : Accretive to your average margin. Roger Krone : Yes. There is not a rule. And really it is customer by customer and competition by competition. We have some programs that start out and they are above our margin. We have other programs, HRP, which is really not an IT program, but RHRP has a six-month very low-level transition built in. So we won\u2019t see RHRP as accretive to margins until significantly into next year just because of the way the contract is structured. So there is not a particular rule of thumb. But we have generalized on this call in the past is it takes us a while after we staff up and we have demonstrated performance to be confident and therefore to raise our accrual rate. But I will turn it over to Chris. Christopher Cage : No, Joe, I would say usually, we kind of say, give us 1.5 years to two-years. It depends. What we like about those contracts in general is they are often - whether a fixed unit rate or fixed price and we do think as we understand the environment better, there is opportunities to introduce more efficiencies into the environment and drive savings that way through automation, through as a service, et cetera. With workforce rebalancing, as Roger indicated, what can you get for lower level employees potentially. So everyone is a little bit different. It depends on whether there is a transition phase, how that was bid, what they are paying you for, so really contract by contract. Joseph DeNardi : Got it. That is helpful. And then, Roger, you said earlier that you can\u2019t necessarily expect to grow 10% every year, which is understandable. I\u2019m just curious if you see that because you are just trying to manage expectations, which is obviously fair or do you not see the opportunities in terms of taking market share over the next couple of years that maybe you had a few years ago? Roger Krone : Yes. Joe, it is really more of the former. Without putting too many numbers out there, we intend this year to submit more proposals in aggregate than we did last year, all right. And we will look at our pipeline, and we have a fairly well disciplined business development process where we go out early five to 10-years, we build a pipeline of potential business. We are not constrained by opportunity. In fact, what we are trying to do is to call out of our pipeline earlier, those things that are not, if you will, not in our strike zone. So we spend our new business funds more efficiently, but we will submit more proposals this year than we did last year. And clearly, last year, we did more than the year before. So it is really not an opportunity. It is, gosh, I would love to think we could grow 10% forever that we were sort of a Silicon Valley high-tech startup. And it is just - we have been very, very fortunate and we don\u2019t want to get too far over our skis. Joseph DeNardi : Thank you. Operator : Our final question today comes from Mariana Perez Mora with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Mariana Perez Mora : Good morning everyone an thank you. Your updated outlook, you mentioned the challenges related to the supply chain and especially the lengthening and the supply chain of computer chips. Would you mind telling us and giving some color on the impact so far and how should we think about the potential impact in the future? Roger Krone : I think I understood your question. Let me take a shot at it. Christopher Cage : And act so far on the main challenges. Roger Krone : Yes, we haven\u2019t seen a lot. We probably have seen - and we install a lot of end-user equipment as part of several of our programs. And so we buy from all of the household names that you are familiar with. And what we are talking about silicon wafers that then get converted into processors, both general-purpose processors and application-specific integrated circuits. What we thought was COVID-related, and we kind of put it into a big category, as we sort of started to come out of COVID, we find that parts of the supply chain shut down in this lower end computer chip market and is not coming back as quickly as anyone thought. And in fact, in some markets like auto, their concerns, some of - certainly at the wafer level that some of that capacity is not going to come back at all. We have not seen shortages. We have just seen delays. And we are planning a couple of years out. But we have seen lengthening in - especially for IT equipment, probably in the weeks to a month in some areas and material has an impact on our revenue, both good when it happens and bad when it gets delayed. And it is a part of why we are not touching guidance for the last six-months. Although we are doing fine now, some of our contracts have significant material purchases planned for the last half of the year. And out of an abundance of caution, we wanted to give you visibility and transparency into our supply chain. Christopher Cage : And I think Mariana, it is definitely something we will spend more time on as we build our 2022 plan because, as Roger indicated, we have relationships, key relationships with critical suppliers and we stay abreast of what is going on there. But while the IT component of many contracts isn\u2019t always our highest margin contributor. It does contribute to revenue. And so therefore, it is fairly integral. So as we get to 2022 planning make sure we have got good line of sight on what the latest expectations are. But this year, with the guidance range we provided, we think we gave ourselves some latitude for some potential delays, modest delays across the supply chain. Roger Krone : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Stuart Davis for closing remarks. Stuart Davis : Thank you, Hector, for your assistance on this morning\u2019s call. And thank you to all joining in this morning and for your interest in Leidos. We look forward to updating you again soon and especially in October. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Stuart Davis with Investor Relations. Stuart, you may now begin. Stuart Davis : Thank you, Rob. And good morning, everyone. I would like to welcome you to our third quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO, and Christopher Cage, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you will also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll use during today's call. Turning to Slide 2 of the presentation, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, as shown on slide 3, during the call we'll discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in today's press release and presentation slides. With that, I will turn the call over to Roger Krone who will begin on slide 4. Roger Krone : Thank you, Stuart. And thank you all for joining us this morning. The third quarter marked another strong quarter for Leidos with record levels of revenue, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP diluted EPS, and backlog. Our success is the direct result of building a business portfolio focused on vital missions and a workforce that is motivated to enhance those missions through technology, engineering, and science. As we described at our October Investor Day, we see continued success ahead based on our scale, positioning, and talented people. To organize my remarks, I'll address 4 messages. First, our financial results demonstrate our ability to grow organically, drive earnings, and generate cash. Second, our business development engine delivered large and important awards that speak to our differentiated position in the market. Third, we're effectively deploying capital to create shareholder value. And fourth, we are investing in our people and building a Company that we can all be proud of. Number 1, our strong financial performance was highlighted by outstanding earnings and cash performance. Revenue of $3.48 billion were up organically 6% year-over-year ahead of the market. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was a $1.80 which was up 22% year-over-year driven by strong operating performance as reflected in our adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.6%. Finally, we generated $565 million of cash flow from operations, and free cash flow of $541 million for our free cash flow conversion ratio of 211% of non-GAAP net income, With an asset-light model and ability to take EBITDA and to convert it to cash and a lean balance sheet, cash generation is a hallmark of Leidos.  Number 2. Business Development continued the momentum that is driving our industry-leading organic growth this year. We achieved net bookings of 4.7 billion in the quarter, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4. Our 15th consecutive quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. As a result, total backlog at the end of the quarter stood at a record $34.7 billion, which was up 9% on a year-over-year basis. I will now touch on 4 of our key wins. We were awarded a $600 million prime contract to continue to support the Army's Geospatial Center, BuckEye mission. We're providing mission critical, unclassified, high-resolution color imagery and digital 3D terrain over all operationally relevant areas of the world. Our scale enabled us to invest in aircraft that we own and operate and a cadre of professionals to support the mission. Through this program, we provide our warfighters with a decisive advantage on the battlefield, and given the unclassified nature of the Buckeye data, support partner nations as well as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.  The National Security Agency awarded us a $300 million prime contract to develop and modernize the agency's Technical Signals Intelligence mission. Under the contract, we provide the technical services to develop, deploy, and sustain a wide range of enhanced Tech SIGINT collection, production, and analysis capabilities that provide our nation's leaders and military troops with actionable intelligence and critical information to protect and defend our country. The US Army awarded are Dynetics subsidiary, a $237 million 2.5 year contract for the enduring Indirect Fire Protection Capability or IFPC to produce a transportable system to engage and defeat cruise missile and unmanned aircraft system threats. Our solution uses an open system architecture that provides both flexibility and growth, as well as full integration with the Army's Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System. Under this initial contract, we'll deliver 16 launcher prototypes and 60 interceptors. I view this as the seed corn if we do it right, IFPC can grow into $1 billion plus program. The contract includes options for full-on production of 400 launchers with associated interceptors. Finally, Customs and Border Protection awarded us another important multi-award IDIQ for non-intrusive inspection. So far this year, we've received 2 IDIQs with a total of $870 million in ceiling value and $200 million in tasking on those contracts. Safeguarding our nation's ports and borders is a critical priority, and CBP has set a goal of 100% screening of cars and cargo at the border versus the single-digit percentages that we achieved today. Congress has appropriated a significant amount of money for more screening.  So we see this as a great opportunity for us. Number 3, I view capital allocation as one of my key functions as CEO, and we're deploying capital to create shareholder value. During the quarter, we bought back a $137 million of our stock through open market repurchases. At our Investor Day in October, we shared a target of $3.5 billion in cash flow from operations from 2022 through 2024. After considering capital expenditures, some debt pay-down, and our dividend program, we'll have approximately $2.2 billion to deploy across M&A and share repurchases. We're always looking at technology add-ons, and so that pipeline is pretty active. In Q3, we added a small strategic acquisition to our Dynetics subsidiary to accelerate some of its growth opportunities. Beyond that, there is currently nothing major on the horizon. We built a portfolio that we're proud of, and we think we're well positioned to grow. We'll pursue large M&A only if we find a property along the way that could really help accelerate our strategy.  Number 4, people are at the heart of what we do, and this quarter demonstrated our ability to attract the talent that we need. During the quarter, we hired more than 2,900 people and at the end of the quarter, we were more than 43,000 strong. Our headcount grew 2% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. Still, recruiting is an evergreen challenge. We have about 1,400 funded vacancies and recruiting and retention remains areas of strategic focus for the leadership team. One of the reasons we're attractive to job applicants is that we invest in upskilling our people and building an innovation culture. As an example, in Q3, we held our first ever Leidos Sphere, a 24-hour virtual technology conference that brought together employees from around the world to share technical solutions.  CTOs, solutions, architects, and other technologists streamed presentations live from the U.S., Australia, Israel, and the UK. I personally saw the clear value for participants with real-time answers to questions and lively chat discussions. In a time of increasingly complex global challenges, our global network of customers and colleagues working together to address those challenges is a competitive differentiator. Another part of what makes Leidos so attractive is that we're a values-based Company. This leadership team is committed to Leidos being a great corporate citizen. We're mindful of our opportunities and responsibilities to our many stakeholders, especially as we grow. With our mission to make the world safer, healthier, and more efficient, we believe we can build a future where our people and technology make a real impact.  Having achieved our legacy greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal, we have now set new environmental goals as well as social and governance goals for 2030. Our new next level Leidos ESG goals highlight key efforts related to cultivating inclusion, advancing environmental sustainability, and promoting healthier lives. We believe these efforts will not only sustain and enrich our culture at Leidos, but they'll also have a positive impact on all of our stakeholders. We'll report our progress annually in our Corporate Responsibility report, which we've been publishing for more than a decade. Through this effort, we're committed to continued transparency and how we're doing from a diversity and environmental standpoint, as well as making the lives of our employees and communities better. And so you'll see that in our disclosures.  Before turning the call over to Chris, I'd like to address the current budget environment as it gives important context for the guidance that he will be providing. As expected, Congress enacted a continuing resolution and suspended the debt ceiling to avoid a shutdown and economic turmoil. Each is now set to expire on December 3rd. The current thinking, is that Congress will try to package the spending bills together into an omnibus spending bill for the president to sign before December 3rd or they may kick the can down the road and pass another CR that could last until next March. In addition, the House has indicated that it plans to attempt to pass two large legislative items this week or maybe this month. The first -- the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure framework to improve the country's roads, bridges, broadband, and other critical infrastructure priorities has already passed the Senate, so it would head to President Biden's desk for signature.  The second, the 1/3 quarters trillion, Build Back Better proposal to overhaul the nation's healthcare, education, climate, and tax laws would head to the Senate for debate. The fate of both bills is still unclear as is the path forward on the spending bills and the debt ceiling. In the face of this uncertainty, some of our customers have tamped down their normal spending patterns. Given the mission critical nature of our work, we expect only a modest impact to our results while the budget issues remain unresolved. I will now turn the call over to Chris Cage. Christopher Cage : Thanks, Roger. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. As Roger said, Q3 was an outstanding quarter for earnings and cash, and I'm proud of the team for delivering such strong operating performance. Let's jump right into the third quarter results, beginning with the income statement on slide 5. Revenues for the quarter were $3.48 billion, up 7% compared to the prior-year quarter. Excluding acquired revenues of $47 million, revenues increased 6% organically with organic growth across all 3 reportable segments. We're pleased to continue to outpace the market, but revenues were below our expectation. The main driver of the shortfall was in lower margin material purchases, due in part to supply chain issues for computers and technology components, and due to reduced activity levels due to concerns over the predictability of funding that Roger just mentioned. We were able to deliver strong earnings despite these factors.  Adjusted EBITDA was $403 million for the third quarter, which was up 16% year-over-year. And adjusted EBITDA margin increased from 10.7% to 11.6% over the same period. This was primarily due to strong program management, higher volumes on some of our fixed-price programs, and better direct labor utilization. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Leidos common stockholders was $257 million for the third quarter, which was up 21% year-over-year, and non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was a $1.80, up 22% compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. Now for an overview of our segment results and key drivers on Slide 6. Defense Solutions revenues increased by 3% compared to the prior-year quarter. Excluding the acquisitions of 1901 Group and Gibbs & Cox, organic revenue was up 1%.  The largest growth driver was the engine ramp, which more than offset the completion of the Human Landing System base contract within Dynetics. Civil revenues increased 3% compared to the prior-year quarter, and all of the growth is now organic. The revenue increase was primarily driven by volume growth on existing programs, including the Antarctic support contract. Our managed IT services support to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, where we're leveraging our 1901 Group acquisition and our engineering support to commercial energy providers. Health revenues increased 31% compared to the prior-year quarter, and all of that growth was organic.  We continue to see a nice ramp on the Military and Family Life Counseling program and dim sum had a large year-over-year increase based on deployment timing. Like last quarter, the largest year-over-year increase was in the disability examination business in our QTC subsidiary. On the margin front, Defense Solutions, non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter came in at 8.8%, which was unchanged compared to the prior-year quarter. Civil non-GAAP operating margin declined from 10.5% in the prior-year quarter to 9.6% as we had fewer deliveries of airport screening systems. Importantly, margins for both Defense and Civil were up sequentially consistent with our long-term view for these segments. Health non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was at 20.7%, compared to 16.3% in the prior-year quarter. This quarter's strong margin performance benefited from the significantly increased revenue volume on fixed unit price programs in the higher direct labor utilization.  Turning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 7, operating cash flow for the quarter was $565 million, and free cash flow, which is net of capital expenditures, was $541 million. The exceptional operating cash flow was driven by strong operational performance across the enterprise and higher customer advance payments and came despite the $62 million cash tax headwind from last year's CARES Act deferral. During the quarter, we paid down $27 million of debt and repurchased 1.4 million shares. In total, we returned a $188 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend program and share repurchases. As of October 1st, 2021, we had $587 million in cash equivalents and $5.1 billion of debt. As we close out the year, we remain committed to a target leverage ratio of three times.  Our long-term balanced capital deployment strategy remains the same, and consists of being appropriately levered, maintaining our investment-grade rating, returning a quarterly dividend to shareholders, reinvesting for growth both organically and inorganically, and returning excess cash to shareholders in a tax-efficient manner. On now to the forward outlook, as shown on Slide 8, we are updating our guidance for fiscal year 2021. Let's walk through the drivers for each metric. We now expect revenues between $13.7 billion and $13.9 billion, which is the bottom half of our previous range. Supply chain delays and customers holding back spending due to concerns over the predictability of funding are the primary drivers here. But some protests have also pushed revenue out of this year. And we're also mindful of the potential impact of vaccine mandates on our workforce.  At the midpoint of revenue guidance, revenues in Q4 would increase about $70 million compared to Q3, driven by the continued ramp on new programs like NGEN offsetting moderation in the volume of our medical exam business. At the revenue midpoint, organic growth for the year would be 9% and total revenue growth would be 12%. We expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin between 10.9% and 11.1%, which is above the previous range as a result of our Q3 outperformance. As the revenue composition shifts in the fourth quarter, we expect EBITDA margins will come back in and land in the mid-10% range. We expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year between $6.55 and $6.75. So we've increased the midpoint of the range by $0.15 based on our Q3 outperformance. Share repurchases in the third quarter will also add about a penny to Q4 non-GAAP diluted EPS. Finally, our expectation for cash from operations is unchanged at $875 million or greater. Our strong Q3 performance increases our confidence in meeting or exceeding $875 million for the year, but the advanced payments in Q3 will be a headwind to Q4 cash generation. Before I close, I want to highlight the 3-year targets we laid out at Investor Day last month. From 2022 through 2024, we're targeting organic revenue CAGR of 5% to 6%. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 10.5% or greater by 2024, free cash flow conversion of approximately 100%, and cumulative cash flow from operations generation of approximately $3.5 billion. Our market positioning, industry-leading scale and technology differentiation support our position and ability to deliver on these targets. With that, I will turn the call over to Rob so we can take some questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time we'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] [Operator Instructions]. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Thank you and our first question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your questions. Peter Arment : Good morning, Roger Chris. Roger Krone : Hey. Good morning, Peter. Peter Arment : Nice results. Hey, Roger, you mentioned some customers tampering down their spending plans just given the uncertainty. Maybe you could just give us a little more color on what's specifically you're seeing? Thanks. Roger Krone : What typically happens -- so we end up with a contract. This IDIQ. We work on [Indiscernible] and then we always anticipate, especially in the next fiscal year, that those customers will come forward with projects which will expand our revenue base. And it's discretionary money on their part, but it's below the IDIQ ceiling. And I'm thinking, in my mind primarily, about 3 or 4 agencies. And those projects just haven't materialized. And the base program is running fine but we always anticipate maybe 10% on some of these IDIQ, kind of test quarter contracts that will come in. And a couple of agencies, specifically, just haven't been spending their project money. And so that's something we sort of plan on. It's not unusual. We've seen it before when the budget uncertainty gets as bad as it is today. And pretty much eventually, I\u2019ll spend that money be it next year or year after. So the work still needs to get done, it's just not getting done in third and fourth quarter. Christopher Cage : And Peter, the only thing I'd add is we're not really seeing that in our civil and health customers, it's pretty much in our Defense Solutions segment between the intel and some defense customers where we're seeing that activity. Peter Arment : Okay. I appreciate that. I'll leave it there at 1. Thanks. Roger Krone : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much, and good morning, everyone. Christopher Cage : Good morning Seth. Seth Seifman : So Chris, I wonder if you could help level set us with the health business. I guess from 2017 to 2019, we had adjusted EBIT pretty regularly and like the $275 million range in that business. 2020 included the COVID impacts, so obviously it would have been much higher. In this year we're looking at something considerably higher than that, maybe even something approaching 500. And so when we think about the headwind that's obviously going to be there next year as the outside exam revenue comes off, can you help us to size the sales and margin impact of that? Christopher Cage : Well, first of all, I want to congratulate our team. I think our team has done an exceptional job running that business and continuing to optimize performance along the way. Clearly this was a banner quarter with the growth and the margins above 20%. I will tell you and we have told you that is not where we see this being sustained. And we have worked down the backlog that came about through the pandemic, and we're seeing a level of referral volume continuing to stay fairly high. So there's some reasons to be a bit optimistic there, but it will come back down. And what we said before is when the business was running at a normal level, it was in the mid-teen margin. And while we don't guide by segment, I would tell you somewhere at that level is certainly the bottom end of what we feel comfortable with.  But with the improvements in the business operations and the growth, I think there is opportunity to do better than that over time. So we're preparing for a scenario where health is not performing at these levels that we've communicated that at Investor Day, and we're driving the rest of the business to make sure we're driving margins up over time. But again, couldn't be more happy with the performance of the health team and we're going to sustain that performance as long as we can. Roger Krone : Yeah. And Seth, as you know, we've got a couple fairly large programs starting up. The Military and Family Life Counseling Program and their Reserve Health Readiness Program, and they will be fully ramped next year. And those are more towards our normative levels that you might see in our defense group. And so it's a great business really proud of the team but next year should look more normal. There's this COVID has created swings in our business that we saw last year and now it's as we had predicted it's swinging back this year. Seth Seifman : Okay, great. That's very helpful on the margin and then maybe just a follow-up on the sales. I assume that the exempt business will be down on the top line next year, but to your point there has been some nice wins and some programs ramping. Can health grow next year, top line? Christopher Cage : Well, so we'll, obviously, get into those details in our fourth quarter call with you. In fact, we're going to be with our team here in a couple of weeks going through the bottoms-up annual plan, but I would say yes. Our expectation is to [Indiscernible] business -- can grow next year and that's certainly the way we're approaching it. So some more to come on the details around that, but we're actively working that and there's a healthy pipeline that we're pursuing at all times. Seth Seifman : Great. Thank you very much. Roger Krone : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gavin Parsons with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Gavin Parsons : Good morning. Christopher Cage : Good morning, Gavin. Gavin Parsons : There's something you had to quantify some of the impacts of the delays or impacts you cited. And then some of the other businesses that may not be kind of running at normal level, right? Health might be a little high, but I think SD&A is a little low. So do you have to quantify the impacts of chip shortages, intel delays, things like that, that would be really helpful. Roger Krone : I'll take a stab, Gavin. So we took down the midpoint of our guidance a $100 million. So that's kind of the size of the pie, if you will, is how we think about potential headwinds that we're facing. And on the material side, which is kind of tied up in some of the chip shortage we've seen, lack of material availability, most are on the computing side, but some technology components impacting our Dynetics or our airborne ISR business, think of that as roughly a third of the impact, right? And then we've got the budgetary headwinds where we expected certain projects to come through. We're not seeing that activity from customers. That's another roughly third of the impact. And then there's this protest bucket.  So we had a couple of programs that we won. And in fact, we had another program that we won last quarter on the TSA side, the TEDS and said, which an OEM underneath that protest. And so we're not able to do some of the work. So there's this bucket of protest activity that costs us some of the revenue miss as well. So there's a few of those things going on. We didn't talk about Afghanistan draw-down, but I would just add that in. That that's certainly -- probably at the higher end of our previous estimates on what that impact will be. So there is a little bit of -- we expected or hoped that we would have some over-the-rise and support that's not really materializing. All those things added together kind of are the $100 million guide down on the midpoint of our revenue. Gavin Parsons : Got it. And then maybe on civil margins. I appreciate that can be pretty lumpy with timing of hardware delivery but it's it to below average quarters in a row here. Anything that's changed structurally there, or is there just a lot of timing going on there as well? When would you expect that to normalize itself? Roger Krone : I would tell you again, I was pleased to see the sequential improvement from Q2. That's our expectation going into next year, we will continue to see that tick up. The team's done an excellent job getting the SD&A business ready for growth in the future when that market rebounds. A lot of new talents been added to the team, we're happy about that. But there's a lot of other things going on Civil. When I highlighted the growth in our commercial energy customer business, which is above the segment average on margins, that will continue to see expansion we believe going into next year, which will help us. So again, the Civil business should be above the corporate average margins. It's slightly below right now, but that's a quarter-to-quarter thing that we see trending up. Gavin Parsons : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Hey. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Christopher Cage : Good morning, Sheila. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Can we think about profitability? Adjusted EBITDA margins are in that 10.3% range in Q4 versus 11.2% year-to-date. What are the drivers of the contraction as we head into Q4? And I think consensus looks at 10.5% margins for next year. So maybe, can you talk about the puts and takes-in for the last quarter of the year and what we should be considering if health margins are mid-teens next year? Christopher Cage : Well, that's one of the -- first of all, Sheila, I'll start and Roger can add in. Health as we've been signaling, there was the expectation that Q4 will start to see a bit of a ramp down on the medical exam business. That might not be the case, but we're preparing for that to be the case. And that clearly will put some dampening on margins overall. I would also point to the execution in Q3 was quite strong. In the program performance side. You'll see when you get into the queue that we had an excellent quarter on net write-ups, and that helped us in the third quarter pick our margins up to 11 6, but we're absolutely targeting kind of that mid-10 rate. And as we paid it in Investor Day, that's kind of our longer view on where the business should be. All things considered in Q4, with the holiday season and uncertainty in health, we feel pretty good about landing in that area. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay. And then maybe 1 more question. Roger, in the release you said you're gaining share. What areas do you find that you're gaining the most traction? Roger Krone : We've always been strongest in this area, If you look at our technical core competency is called digital transformation. And this is moved to the cloud, IT-as-a-Service, helping our customers operate more efficiently. And what has been exciting for us is that line of business crosses really all 5 business units. And we've got some major wins that we've talked about. We've got some things in the pipeline. We've actually moved forward even in the health group with some commercial healthcare providers. And so overall, that's a real strong business for us. And then another area that's really been nice, and again, we talked about this already, is the new wins in the Health group, which has allowed us to grow our Health group faster than the rest of the business.  And in order to do that, things like the Military Family Life and Counseling was a takeaway. The Reserve Health Readiness Program was a takeaway from other people and we have as we said at our Investor Day and Sheila, we've been talking about for years, we want to have that balanced portfolio. And so we're investing in Health and Civil to grow and to grow -- it's great to go after a new business, but sometimes we have to go after re-competes as well and to take business away from others in our industry. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Roger Krone : Yes. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Cai Von Rumohr : Yes. Thanks so much for taking the question. So as we look at the full year, and actually third quarter also, while you say the guides come down $100 million, it's basically very mixed. Clearly, Health looks like it's $200 million or so better for the year, and the big miss is really in Defense. Could you basically drill down a little bit more on the programs? For example, it looks like Dynetics might have been short. So we can understand which programs are contributing to the shortfall. Christopher Cage : Sure, Cai. Obviously Health being up $200 million is against your estimates. We don't give the guidance by segment, but we're pleased with the health growth. And in defense clearly is where we're seeing the preponderance of some of the impacts that we've talked about. The Afghan drawdown, that was a headwind for the team this year, and it's hurt what would ordinarily be a growing airborne business. The material shortages, a lot of that in our Intel customer space have been an impact. We've previously talked earlier this year on the Intelligence Customer Award delays having some impacts on the business as well. Those things are all factors that are driving that, and of course, the Human Landing System Program while we had never put that follow-on in our plan. Clearly, the $240 million that we executed on that 10-month program, That's gone and that becomes a growth headwind. Now Dynetics -- Roger featured the IFPC program in the quarter and we're very bullish on the growth from that over time into the future. So we're excited about some of the programs that they are winning and executing on. But it is a different business model where you're not going to see some of those large franchise program wins in each and every quarter. So there is some variability on how the growth plays out. But if you pull human landing system out of Dynetics performance, they're still on a very nice growth trajectory. Roger, anything to add. Roger Krone : Yes, I would also add, in the 3rd and 4th-quarter we can -- to buy a lot of material in our contracts and then we kind of spend the spring installing it. And the chip shortage has affected the type of -- and we say material. Yeah, we buy raw material, but we buy a lot of computer equipment. PC, laptops, servers, routers, switch gear, and what have you. And we really have seen those supply chains lengthen. A PC we could use to get maybe in 4 months or in 4 weeks, now probably takes 20 weeks. A server, probably the same, maybe if not longer. Some of the networking equipment about the same. Normally we would place the orders -- we get through the fiscal year, we get into the next year funding, we placed these orders, we get the equipment delivered before the end of the year, and we book revenue against it. Now, we're placing those orders. We're on backlog, like everyone else in the industry, and it will arrive in the first quarter. And those programs are primarily in our Defense segment. Cai Von Rumohr : Okay. Thank you very much. Roger Krone : Yes. Christopher Cage : Thank, Cai. Operator : Next question is coming from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Akers : Hi. Yes, thanks. Good morning. Could you comment on CaPex? I mean, it's running a little bit lower year-to-date. Is that something we should expect to pick up next year? And I think you've talked about kind of 1.5% of sales. Is that kind of the right way to think about it in the future? Christopher Cage : Hey, Matt, thanks for the question. You're right, it has been running a little bit lower than our expectations. We do expect a modest ramp up in Q4 from what we've been running at. And 1.5%, I would say that's kind of what we see as the upper bound, right? Our job is to make sure that each and every capital expenditure request passes muster as it relates to returns that we expect to generate from that. And we'll go through the detailed scrub of that in Rio P. As you can imagine, there is some things from a supply chain issue also impacting us on the capital expenditure side where we've -- Roger mentioned, airborne assets and some of the planes that we're outfitting were not able to get some of the technology components to get those in operations. So that's taking longer than it's been expected.  And some of the facilities, especially in the Dynetics side for fabrication in some of our new wins, getting contractors, getting materials to get those things outfit is taking a little bit longer. But -- so a little bit of uptick is what I would expect for the fourth quarter and then as we head into next year, 1.5% I'd say is the upper balance, and we'll kind of see how things play out as far as what the opportunity space looks like when we get through our planning process. Roger Krone : And Matt, we just completed a big hypersonic facility in Huntsville so that's mostly in our history. And then when we moved into the new headquarters here in Reston and we had a new building in Gaithersburg, and we facilitated Campus Point, we went through -- although we lease our facilities generally, we have to buy the capital equipment and do capital improvements. That's going to be down next year, and Chris said -- I'm not sure we've ever been at 1.5%, but somewhere between 1% and 1.3% is probably a working number. And just to reiterate what Chris mentioned, I can think of a couple of projects in the building that we're in, which we have put on hold because we can't get the material to finish it. There's something on the floor above us that we just had to wrap up and leave fallow and probably get it finished probably next year. So it's just amazing how far reaching the supply chain is. And if you look at the pictures of Long Beach Harbor, there's a lot of material out there and [Indiscernible]. Matthew Akers : Great. Thank you. That's really helpful. And just one more on NGEN. I think last quarter, you had mentioned that was one of the reasons to be cautious on the guidance. That it was a new program and you weren't sure of the order pattern. Did that fully ramped up now and is that flowing through at the run rate that you had expected? Roger Krone : Yeah. But I'll give you some details and if I don't cover it sufficiently, Chris will jump in. We're fully staffed on the program. So normally 4000 people give or take a little bit. From a revenue standpoint, though, we won't hit full revenue until next quarter or first quarter. So it's still gotten some room to go from a revenue standpoint. If you're looking for a full-year then it's probably next year or maybe even 23 until we're at the absolute run rate. But the great news is we've taken over the network. We own it now. We have starting the transformation part of the program, which is to move the Navy into, if you will, the next-generation of a short network. And the program is actually running really, really well, and we're literally amazingly went from a ward to fully staffed in literally just a quarter or two, and that's almost unprecedented. So really great stuff on the program. We're not at the max revenue this quarter, but we got a good shot to be close next quarter. Christopher Cage : Yeah, I mean, the team I think it's a highlight across the Company of how quickly they staff that thing up and the executive management attention to get there. Roger mentioned earlier some of our customers have special projects in NGEN will be a program that would have budget for special project. So again, we're learning this customer. We're ready to execute on those as those orders come through, but that's a variable demand signal that we have to be prepared to respond to, but we're pleased with where that sits right now with room to grow. Matthew Akers : Great. Thank you very much. Roger Krone : Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss of Barclays. Please proceed with your question. David Strauss : Thanks. Good morning. Christopher Cage : Good morning. Roger Krone : Good morning, David. David Strauss : I want to ask you how are your recent acquisitions, 1901, Gibbs & Cox doing? The acquired revenue in the quarter was a little lighter than what I was expecting based on what you had indicated Gibbs & Cox would contribute this year. Roger Krone : Well, it's still early on both of those. Let me talk more strategically. The 1901 has been just a real energizer for our digital transformation work. We have used the talent in 1901, really to de -risk our engine ramping and staffing. They have an as-a-service platform and have a culture that just attracts people. And so we were able to set up our call center literally in a month using the people in 1901. And that is really allowed us to get ahead and provide that level of customer service that we wanted to get on NGEN. And its the top-line growth. There's a lot of work on 1901 that happens through the other units, and so the way we account for it, if they facilitate a sale in our Civil Group, you'll see that revenue in our Civil Group, and the way we account for acquisition, revenue is the standalone 1901.  On Gibbs & Cox, on a standalone basis, which is probably not all that relevant even today, because we've combined our heritage link, Leidos Innovation Center Maritime group with Gibbs & Cox, but you don't see that in the way we account for the revenue. And the cross linkages, the synergies between the heritage maritime business where we would have see on our -- in our traps program and some other classified program, and what goes on in Gibbs & Cox. You're not going to get that visibility in our GAAP reported financials. But the naval architecture work and the relationships at NAVC and in the Navy, that now complement our autonomy business and the work that we do under the water has been terrific. And then Gibbs & Cox on a standalone basis, continue to have strong support from the Navy, on the new Frigate contract and the new Destroyer contract, and they continue to grow and to staff. It's really been exciting, they bring a level of systems engineering and platforms that we have wanted to have for a long time. And that knowledge in that culture really we're using across the whole organization. Christopher Cage : Something I'd add on -- what we love about the Gibbs & Cox team is they are so close to the customer, so important to the customer's mission. And they're going to support that mission even in advance of a contract award. For example, just as they become part of a bigger corporation making sure that we're getting out with the right contractual arrangements so we can recognize revenue on some of the work they are doing, they are in a good position to continue growing and delivering. As Roger mentioned, the 1901 group is contributing a lot internally on other programs which are adding value and will ultimately be accretive to our performance. That doesn't show up in the external report that you see. David Strauss : Okay. That helps. And then, Chris, wanted to ask on working capital. It looks like to get down closer to the 875, or a little above that, you're banking in, I would guess, something like a couple $100 million working capital headwind in the fourth-quarter. So can you talk about that and then in terms of your long-range forecast, I know we have the $3.5 billion in operating cash flow that you forecast, but what specifically do you have baked in there in terms of working capital. Do you expect working capital to be a net drag over that period? Thank you. Christopher Cage : Sure, David. So let me first address the fourth quarter and we signaled a couple of main things that are going to go on in the fourth quarter. We talked about advanced payments, and so one of our large programs, customer funds us in advance at the end of their fiscal year, we get that money in our third quarter. There are some material, subcontractors, and other payments that will go out in the fourth-quarter, right? So we get paid, we pay some of them, so that will be an outflow that's already planned and programmed. And then we talked a lot about NGEN and that's, again, a new customer with new buying behavior for us. And one of the things that we'll be in a position to do in the fourth quarter is procure a number of software licenses that they use and execute on. As you can imagine, some of those arrangements are pay-in-advance to the software license providers. The way the Navy funds those is kind of an overtime model.  So there's some of that that's built in in our expectations of working capital usage. Big picture over time, I would tell you this. I like the way the team is managing, working capital today. I think we're having an excellent year. We're programming in improvements where we can make them. We're thoughtful about certain particular business areas that might need a little bit of investment, but that's modest. And so generally speaking, our DSO this quarter at 60 days is something that I see as being able to be sustained, perhaps improved in certain spots. And right now, the way we're going to manage inventory, I think there's a ability to continue to tighten that down and drive improvements into that. So I don't see a big change in our working capital usage to execute our growth plan over the next 3years. David Strauss : Alright. Great. Thanks very much. Christopher Cage : Thank you. Operator : Next question is coming from the line of Mariana Perez Mora with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Mariana Perez Mora : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Roger Krone : Good morning. Christopher Cage : Good morning, Mariana. Mariana Perez Mora : So supply chain, you gave us color on what's going on, but could you please discuss the actions you are taking to mitigate the headwinds and how much of these headwinds could actually slip into next year? Roger Krone : Well, we're doing what everybody else is doing. Our purchasing organization is out having discussions with all of our supplier partners. We're trying to place orders ahead of need, we would be willing to own and hold stock if we can get it. We are trying to substitute what's in inventory for what's not in inventory. We're having discussions frankly with our customers about would they rather wait? Would you rather have the X laptop now or the Y laptop tomorrow? But most of our customers are saying now we'll wait another month to get the Y laptop. We've got really good visibility into our supply chain. We tend to have from a system standpoint, material resource, and planning, our major suppliers connect into our system. So we know where the supply is, we know when it's going to arrive. And as such, we don't want to get ahead of the arrival of the equipment.  But, like everybody in the industry, we see this as a delay not a long-term problem, something that will -- for most of us will correct early next year. I don't think we have the same issues that you might see in the auto industry or in others. And these are supplier partners that we've got 10-year, 20-year relationships with, and we buy a lot of volume, and so we have a preferred position. When they get into the server or the router, we're near the top of the list in getting our fair share. But there's only so much you can do, which is why we talked about it this morning. If the chips aren't there, they're not being put on the boards, they are not being put into the equipment, and we can't put the equipment in the customer and take revenue credit. Mariana Perez Mora : Yeah, that makes sense. And now if I may, switching gears to vaccine mandate. I know the White House is already hinting some flexibility and you mentioned no significant impact, but it will be really helpful if you can give us some color on the workforce vaccination rates, what are the most exposed businesses, and what are your actions to prepare for early December? Roger Krone : Well, we're almost gone through with the call. I could spend an hour on this. I will try to give you a summary, so that you have a good sense of where we are and what we're doing. First of all, we had a sweepstakes, what we call The Carrot, where we encouraged our employees to get vaccinated and we gave 10 employees a year's salary. That was very, very, very successful. We think a lot of people went and got vaccinated. They kind of came off the fence because of the -- we call it the move -- the needle sweepstakes. Okay, we are now looking -- by the way, our current status is, to enter our facility, you have to be vaccinated today or you have to have a recent 72-hour COVID test. And that's all of our facilities. And then customer facilities, we have to follow whatever rule the customer has put in place. And it varies. It varies by -- customer varies by state and varies by county.  We all know there is an Executive Order 14042 that says everyone needs to be vaccinated by the 8th of December. We are working with the customers really down to every contract officer in every contract on what that looks like. I'm sure you know that it allows for exceptions because of the ADA and the civil rights act, which means there is a health exception and religious exception. We are processing exceptions through a relatively rigorous process. We have, if you will, forms you have to fill out, and then we have a group of people who adjudicate that. You asked me, what is our current vaccination status? I can give you a range. We think we're in the mid-90's today. And because that's PHI data, and the requirement to verify your vaccination is not in place here until the 8th of December, we don't know for sure. But based upon all the data we've got, the number of people who have already updated -- uploaded their vaccination card, we think we are in those mid 90's. We worry about a small percentage number of people who won't apply for an exemption, won't get vaccinated, and simply say, \"Hey, I just don't believe it. I'm a non - vaccinater. We think that number is in the single-digit percentages. Were concerned which is why we talked about it on the call. It could have an impact of revenue. If an employee -- if the mandate stays in place as it's written and there's a lot of discussion even yesterday that the firm requirement of December 8th maybe relaxed, but it has not yet been although there's a lot of rhetoric from the White House.  But if an employee, were not to be vaccinated, then we would treat that like any disciplinary action where we go through an oral and then a written and then they have to go through our employee disciplinary board and that will take literally months as it would if you parked in somebody else's parking spot or something like that, and it is unlikely that we would involuntarily separate employees early, but there is a possibility that at some point we're going to have to lay off some people because they don't get vaccinated. We don't want to do that. And we are working with the legislators and with the White House on a sensible implementation of the executive order, but I would tell you right now, it's fluid.  There have been lawsuits filed, there are some states who have said you can't comply, and so we're trying to understand state law versus federal law. Like I said, this could -- this explanation could go on at length, but what we want to do is to keep COVID out of our facilities and out of our customer facilities. And where the EO gives us a great opportunity to do that, and we're going to do everything in our power to keep COVID out and be compliant with the rules and laws and executive order. But we care about our employees, and we are a people Company and our workforce is really, really important. And we're going to do all we can to maintain jobs for our employees. One other benefit that we have -- and then I'll cut this off, Mariana. As I said, it's probably longer than you wanted. Because of our diverse portfolio, we have parts of our business that are not subject to the Executive Order.  We do work for some commercial customers. Actually a considerable amount of work for commercial customers. If it's possible, based upon skill set and geographical location, if we have people who don't want to get the vaccine and they have a skill set that we can use in our civil business, and our civil health business, and some other businesses, we can actually move those people to open jobs in other parts of the business and maintain their employment with Leidos. That's not going to be true in every case. But the strength of having a diverse portfolio that we do have allows us to move people back and forth. And in this COVID world, a fair amount of people are working at home.  So, that adds to our flexibility that we could take someone who maybe was on a Defense contract and move them to a Civil, Commercial and Infrastructure program. We do have a process set up to do that, we are encouraging those non - vaccinators if they would like to take one of the jobs that we have in the Commercial segment. Like I said, I could go on but that's probably more than you wanted to know but I appreciate the question. Mariana Perez Mora : No, I appreciate the [Indiscernible]. Thank you. Christopher Cage : And Rob, I think we have time for 1 more question. Operator : Next question will be coming from the line of Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities. Tobey Sommer : Thank you. I was hoping that you could give us some perspective on what an increase in wage inflation over the next year or two could mean to your different businesses, whether that would crowd out some new contract starts because existing programs may need to be kind of plussed up to keep the staffs and accomplish their mission? Thanks. Roger Krone : Let me give you a quick overview and then Chris can talk about the numbers. So we have yet to see the wage inflation, but we are being thoughtful about that. And with the hiring that we're doing, especially in some geographical areas and some skill sets. The fight for talent is something that we are being very thoughtful about. Tobey, you know, we have forward pricing rates. There's escalation assumed in the forward pricing rates. If we hire ahead or above that then on our cost-type contracts, that makes us a little less competitive while we flow through the customer on our fixed-price contracts, it lowers our fee. The numbers, as we look at '22 and '23, are really small because we procure about half of what we sell and our labor content theory is a percentage of that, and then you have to start seeing where we are on our labor category by labor category. So it's a risk item for everyone in the industry, but it is not yet a significant risk for us. It's literally, I mean, and Chris can probably give you some colors, in the single or double-digit millions.  But it's something we're being thoughtful about is, why in our labor strategy, you have heard us talk about building centers of excellence in areas that are outside some of the large geographical metropolitan areas like The 1901 Group gave us a large footprint in Blacksburg, which we love. By the way, Blacksburg is a fantastic place, a great place to work. The people who work there, love it. They're big Virginia tech fans and is a very different economic environment than trying to hire someone in Reston, Virginia. And our strategy for the past few years have been to be in places like Morgan Town, West Virginia, and Blacksburg. Even St. Louis, which with the movement of the second headquarters of NGA has become a pretty exciting place for us to hire people and to grow. Christopher Cage : And Tobey, it's certainly something, as Roger said, we're being very thoughtful about, we've been thinking about for some time. And actually just had some discussion on this as the leadership team yesterday as part of our planning process. I went through the analysis and I would tell you that the budget that we're establishing for our merit increases for next year will be higher, than what it's been the last several years. We're very cognizant of the fact that that's reality, but it's affordable to do so. And as we've talked about margin levers longer-term, we understand that that's an area we're going to be making a little bit more investment. There is other areas we're going to emphasize. So I don't see that something that puts big headwind on us.  We know how to do this, we know how to attract talent, retain talent, and I think ultimately doing the right thing on the front-end with paying our people can offset costs elsewhere, such as retention or other things that you have to put in place. So again -- big picture, I don't think it's a material driver for near-term margin impacts and it's something we're certainly planning for. Roger Krone : Tobey, I would just to add and I know you've thought through this is the rehire cost, the recruiting cost far exceeds the risk of wage inflation. And so paying at market, or slightly better is always been our philosophy and we want to keep up with market and we would pay more to lose an employee and then go have to recruit of a replacement than a small percentage in wage increase. And our focus frankly is always been about making this a great place to work, attracting people, having them build their career here, and stay with us over the long term. Christopher Cage : Thanks, Tobey. Tobey Sommer : Thank you. Roger Krone : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will turn the call over to Stuart Davis for closing remarks. Stuart Davis : Rob, I want to thank you for your assistance on this morning's call, and thank you to all the listeners and questioners for your time this morning and your interest in Leidos. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll turn the conference over to Stuart Davis with Investor Relations. Stuart, you may now begin. Stuart Davis : Thank you, Rob. And good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; and Chris Cage, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you will also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll use during today's call. Turning to Slide 2 of the presentation. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, as shown on Slide 3, during the call, we'll discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in today's press release and presentation slides. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone, who will begin on Slide 4. Roger Krone : Thank you, Stuart, and thank you all for joining us this morning. 2021 was a banner year for Leidos, with industry-leading organic revenue growth and expanded profitability. In addition, we enhanced our market presence during the year with strategic acquisitions and investments that added important technical capabilities. Despite the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and an extended Continuing Resolution, we are positioned to grow in 2022, bolstered by our scale, differentiated technical offerings, and dedicated workforce. In my remarks, I'll address four topics : our financial results and outlook, capital allocation, business development and people. Number one, our financial performance in the quarter was strong despite a challenging market. Revenues for the quarter were $3.49 billion, up 7% year-over-year. For the year, revenues grew organically across all reportable segments and were up 12% in total compared to 2020. In 2021, our adjusted EBITDA margin of 11% represented the sixth consecutive year of margin expansion and non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 14% to $6.62. We generated $210 million of cash flow from operations in the quarter and free cash flow of $177 million. For the year, that translates to $1.30 billion (sic) [$1.03 billion] of cash flow from operations and $927 million in free cash flow. These results came despite well-documented headwinds, most notably a protracted Continuing Resolution, which slowed both tasking on existing contracts and the award of new opportunities, a resurgence of the pandemic, which lowered workforce productivity and limited our interactions with customers, and a national security community transitioning to new threats. I am proud of how well the team weathered these headwinds. In 2021, we achieved our guidance for all of our metrics, but the standout metric was cash, which came in well ahead of our expectations through close coordination with our customers and strong operational focus. Our asset-light model, lean cost structure and efficient collections process enabled us to generate strong cash flow that we can deploy to grow our business and drive value for our shareholders, which brings me to number two, capital allocation. Over the fiscal year, capital deployment was balanced, with a mix of strategic acquisitions, debt paydown towards our target leverage ratio, an enhanced dividend and share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, we made a strategic investment in HawkEye 360 to build on our multi-decade heritage of serving national security space customers. HawkEye 360 is driving innovative solutions around space-based radio frequency data and analytics, and we're confident this investment will enable us to better serve key customers who safeguard the United States and allied interest. On the opposite side of the ledger, we agreed to divest Aviation & Missile Solutions LLC, a small CEDAR [ph] business within Dynetics. This divestiture allows us to focus on leading-edge and technologically advanced services, solutions and products that are more in our sweet spot. In 2021, we put $270 million towards repurchasing our shares. Looking ahead, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to 20 million shares, replacing the prior authorization. We only had 4.5 million shares remaining on our $20 million share authorization from 2018 and we thought it prudent to increase our buyback capability. Under the authorization, we can repurchase shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, including accelerated share repurchase transactions. Based on the current valuation of our stock, our financial outlook, our liquidity, our view of the M&A market and a consistent operating environment, we expect to be more aggressive on buybacks in 2022, and Chris will provide more color on that shortly. Number three. In business development, the December quarter is seasonally - is the seasonally weakest for our industry. Still, we achieved net bookings of $3.2 billion in the quarter, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 0.9. Importantly, about half of the awards were for new work. For the year, we booked $15.5 billion of awards for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1. Our bookings don't include anything for the roughly $4 billion of protested awards we've been tracking, although earlier this month, we received positive developments on two of them. The FAA re-awarded us our incumbent work modernizing the national aerospace system and GAO denied the protest of our takeaway of the NASA networking communications program known as AEGIS. We're still awaiting word on whether either firm continues to object. Total backlog at the end of the quarter stood at $34.5 billion, which doesn't include any future task orders for many of our large single award IDIQs, like NGEN, with total backlog almost 2.5 times our 2022 revenue, we have a strong foundation for growth. In the fourth quarter, we had large awards in each sector, including ISR Support for the Air Combat Command in defense, operational support to a publicly traded utility and R&D support to the National Energy Technology Laboratory in Civil and IT support to the Federal Parent Locator Service in Health. I want to focus on another award that speaks to what makes Dynetics so attractive to us. Our Dynetics subsidiary was awarded a six-year $479 million cost-plus-fixed fee contract to develop Hypersonic Thermal Protection System prototypes for the U.S. Army's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office. Under the contract, Dynetics will also support materials research, novel inspection and acceptance efforts. The thermal protection system shields elements of the long-range hypersonic weapon system and the navy conventional prompt strike system from extreme environments seen during flight. The army and navy working jointly have made hypersonic weapons their top priority, and this program is just one of the ways that we're supporting the broader hypersonic program. We're also the prime contractor for the common-hypersonic glide body weapon and a key subcontractor for the long-range hypersonic weapon system. These programs are well funded and Dynetics is right at the center of them. Number four, our ability to recruit, retain, motivate and grow our people is critical to our success. We were relatively flat from a headcount standpoint in the quarter but were up 11% for the year. As tough as this year has been for our customers and the market, it's been just as tough for our people. I would like to take a moment to thank the 43,000 Leidos employees for their unwavering commitment and collaboration in light of COVID challenges. We asked a lot of them and they truly delivered, whether executing a complex NGEN transition three months ahead of plan or successfully delivering the MHS GENESIS electronic health record system to an additional 10,000 clinicians and providers as part of its largest wave deployment to date, our teams have put mission first and delivery for our customers. One of the ways that we support our people is through a company culture that fosters a sense of belonging, welcomes all perspectives and contributions and provides equitable access to opportunities and resources for everyone. Inclusion and integrity are intrinsically linked by the responsibility to respect yourself and others. Our employees are empowered to uphold our values, creating a culture that we are incredibly proud of and that makes Leidos unique. We're committed to continued transparency in how we're doing from a diversity standpoint, as well as making the lives of our employees and their communities better. For the first time, we'll publish our consolidated EEO-1 report on our website, which includes detailed information regarding workforce diversity, so we can chart our progress on the journey. Before turning it over to Chris, I'd like to address the current budget environment. Since the Q3 call, Congress passed the fiscal year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act and President Biden signed the bill into law. The NDAA legislation authorizes approximately $740 billion for defense programs, a $25 billion increase to last year and well above the original presidential request. Bipartisan leadership of the House and Senate appropriations panels reached an agreement on February 9 on the fiscal year 2022 top line spending numbers for defense and non-defense programs. Spending levels won't be publicly announced until after the Senate passes another CR. However, it appears there will be an increase for defense accounts and a slightly larger increase for non-defense accounts. Ultimately, 12 appropriation bills will be packaged into a single omnibus bill for floor consideration. We are hopeful that the omnibus will be brought to the floor by March 8 so the President can approve it - so it can be approved by the Senate and then signed by the President before the March 11 CR deadline. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Chris Cage for more details on our results and our 2022 outlook. Christopher Cage : Thanks, Roger. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. With lots to cover, let's jump right into the results, beginning with the income statement on Slide 5. Revenues for the quarter were $3.49 billion, up 7% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding acquired revenues of $52 million, revenues increased 6% organically. For the year, revenues were $13.74 billion, which was up 12% in total and 9% organically compared to 2020. In the quarter, we saw a continuation of the behavior that we cited on our Q3 call, where some customers, especially in the defense and intelligence sectors, worried about the extended CR and held back on funding. This was exacerbated by the limited ability to meet with customers with the onset of the Omicron variant and lower than anticipated direct labor given higher than normal paid time off usage by employees on cost reimbursable contracts. These factors led to revenues in the lower half of the guidance range that we gave on the last call. Turning to earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $359 million for the fourth quarter for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.3%. Margins were down sequentially and year-over-year, consistent with our prior messaging, although higher than normal leave taking and lower than normal net favorable impacts from EACs lowered margins 20 to 30 basis points below our expectations. For the year, adjusted EBITDA was $1.51 billion, which was up 14% over fiscal year 2020. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 11% was an improvement of 20 basis points over 2020. In 2021, we benefited from a $26 million gain related to the Mission Support Alliance joint venture recorded in the first quarter and the backlog of disability exam cases that were pushed from 2020 to 2021 because of COVID. These two items added 60 basis points to the 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin. Non-GAAP net income was $224 million for the quarter and $952 million for the year, which generated non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.56 for the quarter and $6.62 for the year. For the year, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS were up 13% and 14%, respectively, compared to fiscal year 2020. EPS growth benefited from a reduction of about 2 million shares from repurchases during the year. The non-GAAP effective tax rate came in at 22.4% for the year, which was in line with expectations. Now for an overview of our segment results and key drivers on Slide 6. Q4 Defense Solutions revenues of $2.06 billion increased by 7% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the acquisitions of 1901 Group, Gibbs & Cox and a small strategic acquisition, Defense Solutions revenue were up 4% organically. The largest growth driver was the NGEN SMIT ramp, which more than offset the completion of the human landing system-based contract within Dynetics and the program supporting operations in Afghanistan. For the full year, Defense Solutions revenues were $8.03 billion, an increase of 9% in total and 6% organically. Civil revenues were $800 million in the quarter compared to $811 million the prior year quarter, down 1% in total and organically. In the quarter, lower deliveries of security products outweighed increased demand on existing programs with commercial energy providers, the FAA and the National Science Foundation and the transfer of a small number of programs from the Defense Solutions segment. For the year, Civil revenues increased from $2.99 billion in 2020 to $3.16 billion, driven by on-contract growth across many programs and a full year of contribution from the L3Harris Technologies Security Detection and Automation business acquisition. Health revenues were $630 million for the quarter, an increase of 23% compared to the prior year quarter, and all of that growth was organic. The largest year-over-year increase was in the disability examination business, with the Military and Family Life Counseling program and DHMSM up nicely as well. As we previewed on the last call, fourth quarter revenues for the Health segment were down from the third quarter as we completed the backlog of cases from 2020. Health revenues were $2.55 billion for the year, up 30% over 2020 with the same drivers that I cited for the quarter. On the margin front, on Slide 7. Defense Solutions margins were relatively stable. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 8.2% for the quarter compared to 8.9% in the prior year quarter and 8.6% for the year compared to 8.2% in 2020. Civil non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 10%, which was up sequentially but down from 12.3% in the prior year quarter. Civil non-GAAP operating margin for the year was 10.2% compared to 11.7% in the prior year. Declines in segment profitability for the quarter and year were primarily attributable to lower volumes of security product deliveries. Health non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter decreased from 18.5% in the prior year quarter to 17.8% primarily from investments to enhance long-term program execution. Health non-GAAP operating margin for the year increased from 14.4% in fiscal year 2020 to 18.8%, primarily from increased volume on fixed unit price programs. Turning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 8. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $210 million, and free cash flow, which is net of capital expenditures, was $177 million. This was exceptional performance across every segment and enabled us to close out the year with operating cash flow of $1.03 billion, well above our guidance threshold of $875 million. Free cash flow for the year was $927 million for a 98% conversion rate. Without the $62 million headwind from the CARES Act tax deferral, we would have exceeded our 100% conversion target for the fourth straight year. As we close out the year, we remain committed to a target leverage ratio of three times. Our long-term, balanced capital deployment strategy remains the same and consists of being appropriately levered and maintaining our investment grade rating; returning a quarterly dividend to our shareholders; reinvesting for growth, both organically and inorganically; and returning excess cash to shareholders in a tax efficient manner. On now to the forward outlook on Slide 9. Before commenting on 2022, let me first close out the financial projections we gave at our 2019 Investor Day. FY '21 marked the end of a 3 year forecast period, and we exceeded or achieved all of our financial targets. Over the period, we grew organically at a compound annual growth rate of 7% versus a 5% target, achieved an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.8% versus a 10% or greater target and converted 116% of adjusted net income into free cash flow above our 100% or greater target. As we look towards 2022, there are some important factors to consider. There is no guarantee that we'll get an omnibus spending bill in February; the continuing impacts of COVID are unknown, and it's likely that Omicron won't be the last coronavirus variant. We can't be sure how long it will take to get our two large takeaway awards through the protest cycle; and we should expect that the large awards that we will receive this year will be delayed through protest. We want to take a measured, balanced approach to guidance, recognizing that there are significant outside forces to contend with. With that, let's walk through the drivers for each metric. We expect revenues between $13.9 billion and $14.3 billion, reflecting growth in the range of 1% to 4% over fiscal year 2021. This growth would almost entirely be organic when balancing the remaining revenues from 2021 acquisitions with the divestiture that Roger mentioned. To put that growth into context, let's consider the puts and takes moving from 2021 to 2022. On the positive side, we have NGEN and some other wins that are still ramping that provide good visibility into the upside. On the negative side, we have about $160 million of headwind from the Afghanistan drawdown, about $80 million reduction in disability exam volume and another $80 million from the human landing system program. These were all known and discussed as of the Q3 call. Since then, a few additional headwinds have emerged. First, we were not awarded the follow-on to our NGA UFS work that was consolidated into the UDS procurement. UFS represented about $100 million of revenue in 2021 with the opportunity to more than double that amount if we had won UDS. In addition, the customer has recently notified us that they are not yet ready to complete the RHRP transition. This program should generate about $150 million of revenue a year and the start date has now been pushed from January until September. Finally, the multibillion-dollar FAA network procurement known as FENS has just been pushed from an expected award date in Q1 to at least Q4. Moving on, we expect 2022 adjusted EBITDA margin between 10.3% and 10.5%. The mid-point of the margin range is the same as 2021 when you exclude the $26 million MSA gain and the extra disability exam case load. And the top end of the range is consistent with the target we laid out at our October Investor Day. We're committed to long-term margin expansion with multiple levers over time. We expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year between $6.10 and $6.50 on the basis of 142 million shares outstanding, which is unchanged from fourth quarter levels. Finally, we expect operating cash flow of at least $1 billion. This guidance incorporates the final $62 million repayment of the 2020 CARES Act payroll tax deferral. As you're aware, there was a provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that went into effect at the start of the year that requires us to capitalize and amortize research and development costs. Our operating cash flow guidance assumes that the provision will be deferred, modified or repealed. We currently estimate the impact of the provision on fiscal year 2020 operating cash flow - 2022 operating cash flow to be about $150 million. Expanding on Rogers capital allocation comments, we expect to deploy a significant portion of our operating cash flow towards share repurchases, assuming no unforeseen material developments in our operating environment. Depending upon the share price and timing of any repurchases, we currently estimate this could add $0.10 to $0.20 to 2022 non-GAAP EPS. The $6.10 to $6.50 range we provided does not account for any repurchases, and we'll update you all as we go through the year. Given the industry factors that we've addressed, we expect a slower start to the year with a sequential decline in revenues in Q1, which is normal for us. We expect both revenues and margins to build significantly throughout the year. Now a couple of other comments to help you with modeling 2022. We expect net interest expense of approximately $190 million and a non-GAAP tax rate of about 23%. Capital expenditures are targeted at approximately $150 million or roughly 1% of revenues. Before we open up for questions, I would like to comment on something you will see in our upcoming 10-K filing related to a portion of our business that conducts international operations. In late 2021, we discovered through our internal processes activities by certain of our employees and third parties raising concerns that there may have been violations of our code of conduct and potentially applicable laws, including the FCPA. We're conducting an internal investigation led by an independent committee of our Board and have retained outside counsel to investigate. We voluntarily self-reported our investigation to the DOJ and SEC. Because the investigation is ongoing, we're not able to anticipate the ultimate outcome or impact. As we look to 2022, we recognize the challenges, but believe we're well positioned to navigate them. Ultimately, the issues facing our industry are transitory and what remain are urgent needs for our customers and a compelling value proposition that we can offer as the largest, most capable company in our industry. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob so we can take some questions. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Seth Seifman : Hey, thanks very much, and good morning. Roger Krone : Hey, good morning, Seth. Seth Seifman : Chris, I think if I caught the headwinds you mentioned, it probably, it sounds like it adds up to maybe $450 million or so for 2022. And I guess if you could outline the places where you expect to be able to offset that. Just given that, that by itself, it seems like a reasonable amount of headwind to overcome next year? Christopher Cage : Sure, Seth. Thanks for the question. No, absolutely. I mean we're fortunate that going into the second year of the NGEN program, we have really strong visibility into how that program will continue to ramp up. And kudos to our team that's just done an excellent job getting that transitioned early. And now we're starting to see some of the project work that follows on to that program as well. So that's certainly one catalyst. We previously talked about the Military and Family Life Counseling program continuing to ramp up as we transition forward. Roger featured the thermal protection system program. There is several nice things going on within Dynetics that we're excited about, the IFPC program that we won in the third quarter, a thermal protection program. So those will both be transitioning into a growth mode. We had expected, obviously, we were hopeful RHRP would have been a big growth catalyst for us this year. We still expect it to be, but that's been pushed out for six months now. And then ultimately, one of the other big swingers will be what happens with AEGIS. We've modeled AEGIS to come in later in the year because we're anticipating potentially further action by the incumbent to delay that award. If they don't, that potentially gives us upside on the revenue line. But that's how we've positioned it within the guidance that we provided today. Seth Seifman : Okay, great. Thanks. And then maybe just to dig in a little bit more. I know you guys don't guide by segment, but just for Health, you talked about the $80 million exam headwind. But just if we thought about Health at the overall level, just because it's been - that piece of the business has been running so hot, just thinking about the - even qualitative discussion about the overall level of growth or contraction in Health and the level of margin pressure? Christopher Cage : Well, as we said, we do expect to be able to continue to grow our Health business. We have programs like DHMSM that continue to ramp up, which gives us a nice visibility there. Ultimately, RHRP will be an important contributor. But the 2022 revenue and profitability for the segment is consistent with what we've been trying to position, which is we knew that margins would be coming down. We had talked about potentially in the mid-teen area. We're on track with that expectation. The COVID case backlog has been worked down, but that particular line of business still performs excellently, we're very pleased with their performance. And there is a number of other large opportunities in the pipeline. But given the timing that we've seen on how procurements have been delayed, we're just being cautious about when those procurements might come out and our ability to win those and begin to execute. Seth Seifman : Okay. Thank you very much. Roger Krone : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Hey. Good morning, Roger, Chris, since Seth\u2026 Roger Krone : Good morning, Sheila. Sheila Kahyaoglu : \u2026asked about the margins, I might as well ask about the balance sheet then. You both mentioned more aggressive with share repurchases. Obviously, that's deviating a little bit from your M&A strategy. So how do you kind of think about that? And what's your appetite for larger deals? Roger Krone : Hey, thanks, Sheila, and good morning. We're pretty transparent on the bigger deals. We're not really enthusiastic about what is out there. We - and we talked about this before, of course, Sheila, is that we've done some major transactions over the past several years and we're now performing against those. And our M&A is really focused on adding capability or access to a new customer, and those tend to be smaller. And barring something that really is transformative, our capital allocation is going to stay the way it has been, which is we invest in the company, we pay a dividend, we maintain our debt level and then we find a tax efficient way to give the excess cash back to our shareholders. And of course, we've said some things this quarter that indicate that we have less need for that cash. So take that as you will, but we are such a great cash generator. Our ability year-over-year to raise the dividend, buy back shares, I think, is impressive, and we're just saying we believe that will continue in the future. Sheila Kahyaoglu : And then maybe one on Civil segment. I think it declined in the quarter, and it was one of the - I think it was the lowest growth segment in 2021, but it's unlike your Analyst Day end market outlook. So can you kind of talk about what drives the reacceleration of growth in Civil and kind of your expectations there for 2022? Roger Krone : Well, I'll talk about a couple of things, and I'll let Chris follow. Civil is an area where protests and program delays really hurt us. We had a program named FILMS [ph], which is in protest. AEGIS was in protest. The FENS program at one time could have been a '21 award, and we thought it was a first quarter '22 and now it looks like it's a third quarter '22. So as we mentioned, both in my piece and in Chris, the delay of acquisitions have, I think, hurt the industry across the board. And for us, I think Civil took a major part of the brunt of that. But these - by the way, these programs are still going to happen. And so we're enthusiastic about our competitive position. The customer just has to get them through the acquisition cycle and they've got to get awarded and then we've got to sort our way through the protest period. And we mentioned with AEGIS, we don't know what's going to happen to AEGIS. Some of that upside, maybe that will get resolved earlier. But if there's another round of protest at Court of Federal Claims, it could be somewhere again. And then the Omicron variant kind of kept our security detection business sort of at nominative levels. We were hoping for a much stronger rebound in - frankly, in air travel and leisure, and although we have seen a rebound, but nowhere near what we had hoped. And I don't know, here in D.C., we'll look like we'll come off the back of Omicron, we have our fingers crossed, but I've said that before, and there could be another variant right behind it. Christopher Cage : Yes. Sheila, the only thing I'd add, I mean Roger mentioned a few. We certainly continue to see a number of digital transformation, IT modernization opportunities within the Civil customer set. And those tend to be bigger and they tend to take longer to get through a decision process, but we like that aspect of the pipeline. But he also mentioned SD&A, and that will continue to be something that we're assuming is not a growth catalyst in the near-term, but positioning that for '23 and beyond. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay, thank you. Roger Krone : Yeah. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. Matt Akers : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the questions\u2026 Roger Krone : Hey, good morning. Christopher Cage : Morning. Matt Akers : I was wondering if you could comment on the long-term 5% to 6% organic growth target. And just if you could give us maybe sort of a walk of what are kind of the biggest things. I know you mentioned some of the - I think at Civil in the last question. But if you just can sort of kind of bridge the gap from '22 growth to where you think it will be longer term? Roger Krone : Well, I'll mention a couple of things and I'll let Chris add. But the Defense Enclave Services, if you were around the office, you will know what we're talking about in the hallways, I mean we were right up against that award. And that's a - it's just a large program, I can't underestimate how big that program is. And there's another competitor, and it's a very competitive program. And we're hoping that it will be a first quarter award with probably at least a 100 day protest, maybe more than that. And so that will start to ramp, assuming we win that later in the year. And then Chris touched on a couple of things. RHRP will start ramping. We'll get a full year of maybe NextGen. So there's a lot that can happen for us that's very, very positive. But here we are in the first quarter frankly with a fair amount of uncertainty. And you saw where we are on the guide, it's a nice range on the guide. We're going to do everything we can to get to the high end of that. But with the CR and Omicron and Ukraine and everything else that's going on, we thought positioning ourselves where we did was the right thing to do. Christopher Cage : That's right. Matt, just a couple other things I'd mention. Again, as we look towards that 3 year time horizon, especially '23 and '24, I talked about a couple of the Dynetics programs, we continue to be excited about the positions on prototype programs that they're winning, which ultimately we have every expectation will turn into more full scale production programs and those could be significant growth catalysts for those out years. The return of the aviation screening market, again, cautious outlook in 2022, but we're several hundred million dollars below levels pre pandemic for that combined business as far as the top line goes. So that could be a future growth catalyst area. And then Roger mentioned a couple of the big programs that we're tracking, whether it be DES or FENS, AEGIS, and there's many more in the pipeline. So that's how we kind of think about it. There's several things that we anticipate over the course of this year will position us for accelerating our growth rate. But until we can bring those things in with more visibility, we'll be cautious on the near term outlook. Matt Akers : Great. That's helpful. And I guess is there any more you can tell us on - you mentioned the issue that you discovered late last year of potential FCPA violations. Is there anything more you can give us on the magnitude or when that might get resolved? Roger Krone : Yeah. We wish we could. But when you have these open investigations, we're really restrained on what we can tell you. So - and I think Chris pretty much paraphrased the paragraphs you see in the litigation section in the K. But what we will tell you is when we have more to tell you, we'll let you know. But right now, it's an open investigation and we're proceeding. And sometime in the future, we'll have more to say. Matt Akers : Understood. Thanks. Roger Krone : Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gavin Parsons with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Gavin Parsons : Hey, good morning. Roger Krone : Hey. Good morning, Gavin. Gavin Parsons : Chris, I appreciate all the color on the revenue bridge on the headwinds and tailwinds. Could you help us quantify the impact this year of, assume full quarter of a CR, the procurement delays, the COVID-related utilization, any of those other headwinds that aren't the program specific numbers you just gave us? Christopher Cage : Well, it's all kind of tied in. As we thought about that, we took a view of when decisions might be made on some of the new programs that we're chasing and also kind of really layering in what we saw in the third and fourth quarter as far as lower than normal activity on kind of on-contract growth activity, Matt - or Gavin. So again, it's more of a point-by-point as we thought through our pipeline and award timing and decisions. But obviously, where we position kind of the mid-point of the growth, all those things considered, shaved a couple of points off of where we ordinarily might have been. Gavin Parsons : Got it. So then maybe to Roger, how do you think about the level of conservatism that, that does encapsulate kind of given how unpredictable a lot of these headwinds have been? But it also sounds like maybe you're assuming some contribution from DES, which could be a coin flip. So how are you thinking about the level of conservatism that you've baked in here? Roger Krone : Well, we really want, especially with everything that's going on this year, we want to be in a really balanced position here in the first quarter. And then as these decisions, we need to get an omnibus, we need to get some of these programs awarded, as we can release that risk, then - your words, not mine, conservatism, I would rather call it balance, we can rebalance where we are throughout the year. And there are just so many multibillion-dollar opportunities ahead of us that with potential for another COVID variant, I think we're going to get an omnibus. But if not, I mean, there's still people in Washington saying there could be a potential government shutdown. And here we are, and we haven't even had the State of the Union or the skinny budget by the President. So there's a lot of uncertainty here in D.C. if you listen to radio. And so we just want to be in a position where we've got a good range, and we can work away up in the range as these risk items get released. Gavin Parsons : Got it. I appreciate it. And a quick clarification to just Matt's question. Is 5% to 6% still the right 3 year range? Or should we think of this year as normally disrupted and it's 5% to 6% after '22? Christopher Cage : Yes. We haven't - Gavin, at this point in time, we're not changing kind of that 3 year CAGR outlook, right. There's lower starting point than we had anticipated given the dynamics that have played out over the last couple of months, but as we pointed to many paths to continue to get there. And as we resolve some of these major swingers such as DES and others in the near term, hopefully, we'll be able to give you more clarification on that 3 year outlook. Gavin Parsons : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Robert Spingarn : Good morning. Roger Krone : Morning. Christopher Cage : Morning, Robert. Robert Spingarn : So yeah, hey, I don't know if Roger or Chris, which one of you want to take this, but we talked about '22 being a bit of a transitionary year from a revenue perspective. I wanted to try, with COVID lingering and the CR going into March, I wanted to ask the question from a margin perspective. And you've got Civil, which improved a little sequentially, but it's still down on the security detection. How do you think about the segment margins in '22? And how does that compare to normal? Christopher Cage : Well, I'll start and Roger might have some thoughts here, too, Robert. I would say that we've been signaling for some time now that Health was running at an elevated level and that was going to moderate down. And I'll tell you that the conversations we've been having internal to the business around the other lines of business have been around margin expansion opportunities and where are those going to come from and what actions are we taking. And so as we built our 2022, we're finding opportunities and challenging the business leaders to drive margin expansion across their portfolios. And we're doing that in a thoughtful and balanced way but have good confidence on the levers to pull to make that a reality over time. So I think that's what you should continue to see, is a little bit more rebalancing of the margins across the portfolio and then getting the Health group to a position that is stable, that we can grow off of there. And so that's the way '22 should play out for you as far as margins go. Roger Krone : And Rob - go ahead and ask your question. Robert Spingarn : I didn't want to interrupt you, Roger. Roger Krone : No, Rob, I don't want to interrupt you. Robert Spingarn : Well, longer term, getting back to like an 11% type of number, what time frame should that be? Christopher Cage : Well, for Civil, if you're talking about Civil specifically, I mean, it gets to 11% if there's a significant rebound across our aviation screening market, right. That's critical to that portfolio, and that's an above average margin piece of the portfolio, the volume needs to increase there. As we've signaled, we're hopeful, at this point in time, we'll see that continuing to get to those levels starting in 2023 and growing from there. But the core aspects of the portfolio wouldn't be 11% without a decent contribution across the security products business. Roger Krone : Rob, I'll make the point that I was going to make earlier. You raise margin in our business, really two ways, right, through operating performance, being more efficient, scale, being able to spend less capital, less R&D, less marketing because you have size, right. And we've been on that journey, and you've seen some real benefits from that. The other way you can raise margin in our business is you change your mix, right. We don't bid on relatively low LPTA 3% bids, and we bid on highly value-added differentiated programs like the thermal protection system. But if you've got a contract that's 4 or 5 years to support a mission where you're doing maintenance operations and maintenance work, those things have to roll off so the portfolio mix doesn't change as quickly as perhaps you would like or perhaps our investors would like. And by the way, those are good contracts and they generate a lot of cash and they help us build relationships with customers. So we have been moving over time really on both fronts, operating better, being more efficient, using our discretionary funds better. But also, if you will, moving up on the value chain and bidding on more differentiated work and then shying away from things that are LPTA and more commodity. Robert Spingarn : Okay. And Chris, when I mentioned the 11%, I was thinking enterprise-wide, just... Christopher Cage : Yes, Rob, well, you're challenging me today then on 11% for the enterprise, well, that was a great year last year, as we pointed to. 60 basis points came from a couple of items that aren't going to repeat. We signaled 10.5% as our long-term target at Investor Day. Again, our expectation is to get to that level and then - and we do believe, as Roger pointed out, depending upon the mix in the portfolio, continuing to pursue areas, contracts, work areas that will give us margin expansion opportunities from there. Robert Spingarn : Got it, got it. Thank you, both. Roger Krone : Thank you. Christopher Cage : Thanks, Rob. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Colin Canfield with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Colin Canfield : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. So just a follow-up first on Matt and Gavin's question. With respect to the headcount growth and kind of your organic targets that are applying FY '23, FY '24 of mid single digit to high single digit. Can you just talk us about - talk to us about the headcount growth assumed in getting into that accelerated organic growth rate? Roger Krone : Well, yeah, I mean, we can. Let's see, we don't really put out numbers, but we obviously have to add heads. We're at about nominally 43,000. The exact number will be in the K, maybe just a little short of 43,000 by like 20 or 30. And we have to add a significant number of people in the thousands, again, without putting out a specific number. And I think your question is really more of the risk around being able to continue to attract people to the company. And we - that's something actually, as a leadership team, we look at literally every week. And when you look at the number of people that we've hired and the people who have left, either the great resignation who have left the industry or retired or the people that have gone to competitors. And we are still comfortable with our ability to attract and retain the workforce that we need. The other question we usually get is about wage inflation, and I'll just hit that one, is that, we have seen a little bit of uptick in what we're paying people. It's all based in our numbers and our guidance. But we're also seeing the opportunity to hire some college grads at a lower wage rate. And frankly, some of the skills we need are coming right out of college, like Python programming language. And so that allows us to bring in some earlier career people into our cost structure which has a beneficial effect. So we always say that the workforce is a risk item for us, but we've been fortunate to create a company and a culture where people want to come to work. And we - frankly, our first six weeks of the year have been pretty impressive on the hiring that we've already done in 2022. Christopher Cage : Colin, the only thing I would add to Roger's comment, and he's right, it is thousands of employees, but it's not - doesn't have to grow at the same rate as revenue because some of the things we pointed to for the '23 and '24 catalysts are going to come more on the manufacturing product side, those production programs in Dynetics and the return of the SD&A business market that we expect. Those don't require the same level of headcount growth contributions to drive that revenue uplift. So it's a big challenge, we're focused on it, but it's not a one-for-one relationship to get to the outcome. Colin Canfield : Got it. Thanks. And then with respect to the margin question, kind of following up to Rob's vein of thinking, both you and CACI are assuming that you can mix shift kind of into better work. Can you just talk us about what sort of competitive win rate you're assuming on hardware type contracts and kind of where Leidos competes on price versus capability? Roger Krone : Let's see. I'm not sure I even know the number on hardware versus digital transformation. I'll describe just a little bit. The acquisition process for us on hardware is very, very different than, say, some of our large digital transformation opportunities. The large digital transformations are a lot of bidders, RFP process, draft RFP, competitive bid, maybe down selected to then a competitive bid. On the hardware side, it starts with spending our own R&D to create a concept and investing in a prototype or a demo or a simulation and then maybe getting a CRADA, like a cooperative research program where we take it out in the field and we shoot a prototype and we get a customer interested in it. And eventually that leads to a limited production order, which can actually lead to a large production order. So for us, I can't speak to the other people in our industry, in the areas where we compete, we're really competing off of differentiated technology that we've developed. Very rarely are we taking our widget against somebody else's widget and a third-party's widget and we're fighting it out in the proposal process, which, again, is typically in our large digital transformation jobs, how we win there. And it's why we like some of this in our mix. If you followed our story over the long term, we've said we would like a little bit more product, a little bit more hardware, where we can invest in a differentiation and then we can reap the benefits of that over the long-term. Christopher Cage : The only other thing I'd add there, Colin, is on the differentiation front, the other attribute that allows us to be successful is speed. And we've talked about that, but we're more nimble, we're more agile. And so sometimes as we're looking at positioning for emerging capabilities, our ability to get that delivered and fielded more quickly, because we can respond more quickly, is a characteristic that allows us to be successful. Roger Krone : Yeah. Just an example there, because you can tell that we're really excited about this part of our business. We had a customer who needed an airborne asset. And we went from concept to delivery within 12 months. So we bought the airplane, we minded [ph] the airplane, we put equipment in, the customer gave us some GFE, we went through a test program, we got and fielded within 12 months. And that speed, security and scale, we think, is one of our differentiators. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Mariana Perez Mora of Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Mariana Perez Mora : Good morning, everyone. Roger Krone : Morning. Mariana Perez Mora : So 1% to 4% organic growth, what makes you confident that this is just a slow start and you could get to the mid-single digits growth in the next 3 years and this is not a new normal from a macro environment? So in other words, given this uncertain environment, why not under promise and over deliver? Christopher Cage : Well, we're only giving '22 guidance today, right? And so we're trying to make sure that based on the factors we've seen, Mariana, over the last 4 months, it reflects those challenges that we see. But at the same time, we also see these needs and these opportunities in the pipeline. And so as we sit here today, we look at where our customer is going and the things that we think ultimately they will be buying and the demands that they have and the funding levels that we believe will be there still give us the ability to achieve that longer term aspiration that we have for growth. But for right now, '22, you're right, it is a little bit more of a cautious start given the uncertainty in the environment today. But we try to paint a picture of how that could increase our growth rate over time, depending upon how some of these uncertainties resolve themselves. Roger Krone : Yeah. And Mariana, we've talked about this in the past, is we have been trying to position the company to where we think the puck will be in the future. So - and as we look at the omnibus, we think there's going to be an even greater growth in non-defense. So that will benefit us in our Health and Civil business, which we have bolstered over the past several years. And then within Defense, the shift to great power competition, which we think benefits things like space and hypersonics and electronic warfare, again, areas that we have been positioning now for years. And so we're enthusiastic about the long term. In first quarter of 2022, there's just a lot of risk that needs to be retired which is why we are where we are. Mariana Perez Mora : Thank you. And then could you please discuss on competitive dynamics [indiscernible] win rate [ph] some pricing pressure being affected as more industry players are also doing the scale and sculpt strategy? Christopher Cage : Competitive dynamics, so I would say that it's the same competitors that we go up against typically. And we're - we have a great team leading our business development, great capture managers, a good price to win team. We think we have a good pulse on what each procurement competitive set looks like, and so each one is different. To Roger's earlier point, we do try to steer away early in the process in our pipeline of things that we believe are only going to be based upon a price oriented decision, that's not where we want to compete. But clearly, I mean, the market is always competitive and we approach it that way. So there's no different - we're not taking our eye off the ball, we always go after everything, anticipating that it's going to be highly competitive, we need to put our best foot forward. And so that's the way we've been prosecuting the bids in our pipeline. Mariana Perez Mora : Thank you very much. Roger Krone : And Rob, it looks like we're coming up to the top of the hour, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Yes, that question will be coming from the line of Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities. Tobey Sommer : I was wondering if you could give us a perspective on the proportion of your business up for re-compete this year and next and how that may inform the aperture that you have in your business development pipeline to look for new and takeaway work? Christopher Cage : Hey, Tobey, this is Chris, and Roger can add some more color. I would say it's actually a lower-than-normal year in '22, and so that kind of informs our internal goal on what we think our book-to-bill needs to be and what our target is. So absolutely, it's an increased percentage of takeaway and new business opportunities that we're going after, ad that comes with lower expected win rates. So we have to be very thoughtful about the volume that we're prosecuting through. And certainly, we don't take our eye off the ball on any re-competes and put our best foot forward. But it is a lower than average year, which is great. So we're definitely more on the attack in '22 than we might ordinarily be. Tobey Sommer : Would that hold true for '23 as well? Christopher Cage : I would tell you that we haven't probably broken that down with great visibility yet. I mean there is not one of our top 10 programs that come to mind that are coming up for a re-compete cycle next year. So -- but more color on that as we get our way through the year, Tobey. Tobey Sommer : Okay. Thank you. Christopher Cage : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I will now turn the floor back to management for closing remarks. Stuart Davis : Thank you, Rob, for your assistance on this morning's call. And thank you all for your time this morning and your interest in Leidos. We look forward to updating you again soon. Have a great day. Operator : This will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone today should require Operator assistance during the conference, [Operator instructions]. Please note, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll turn the conference over to Stuart Davis, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Stuart, you may now begin. Stuart Davis : Thank you, Rob. And good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our first quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; and Chris Cage, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you will also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll use during today's call.  Turning to Slide 2 of the presentation, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, as shown on Slide 3, during the call, we'll discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in today's press release and presentation slides. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone, who will begin on Slide 4. Roger Krone : Thank you, Stuart and thank you all for joining us this morning. Our first quarter marked a strong start to 2022 with record levels of revenue, backlog and backlog standing from our leadership position in the government technology market. We continue to build our reputation and track record of performance in digital technology, cyber and innovation -- innovative systems across our diversified, resilient business portfolio. Our strong first quarter results and the improving federal budget picture increase our confidence in delivering on our full year financial commitments.  I'll organize my remarks around four messages. 1. Our financial results demonstrate our ability to meet our commitments and outperform the market. 2. Our Business Development results, are a testament to our differentiated position in the market. 3. Our consistent capital allocation approach drives shareholder value, and 4. We are able to attract the workforce we need and develop them for long-term success. 1. Our financial performance was strong at both the top and bottom lines. Revenues of $3.49 billion were up 5.4% in total and up 4.4% organically year-over-year, which is once again towards the top of the market.  Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was a $1.58 with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.2%. All three metrics were ahead of our plan for the quarter. Finally, we generated $93 million of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $65 million. We remain on track to generate more than a billion dollars of operating cash flow this year. Number 2, Business Development sustained the momentum that drove our industry-leading organic growth last year, we achieved net bookings of $5.4 billion in the quarter, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.6. As a result, total backlog at the end of the quarter stood at a record $36.3 billion, which was up 11.6% year-over-year.  The awards in the quarter were rich and new business and takeaways balanced across our three segments and constant -- and concentrated in key capability areas, including digital transformation and cyber. In civil, two large awards successfully completed lengthy protests. We won that $2.5 billion 10-year advanced enterprise Global Information Technology Solutions. We're agents program, where we will provide communication, data center cloud and cybersecurity services across all of NASA centers and facilities.  For the FAA, we'll continue our more than 20 years of support on the national aerospace systems integration support contract. The new NISSC contract is a single award IDIQ with a $1.7 billion ceiling across 10 years. Our working conferences, strategic and transition planning, flight procedures, security, and safety, data analytics and unmanned aircraft systems in support of air traffic control, modernization efforts. In Health, we won two multiple award IDIQs totaling about $1.7 billion over six and a half years to provide disability examinations for the veterans benefits administration. The first was a re-compete for pre -discharge exams in the United States, and the second is a new area for us, exams outside the United States.  Although we'll have more competition within our legacy business, we're excited about the opportunity to expand internationally. In Defense Solutions, our Gibbs and Cox subsidiary won a $319 million five-year award for ship design engineering services for the U.S. Navy's future service combatant program. We won two new cyber programs totaling $340 million, focusing on Agile Secure DevOps, cyber inspection and assessment, continuous monitoring, and audit and security management services. We also had a takeaway win on a $100 million single-award IDIQ to modernize the Army's gunnery training simulation systems.  This work serves to enhance readiness across the operational spectrum in support of national defense. And the biggest, most impactful win for the quarter is not included in our bookings. We were awarded the $11.5 billion Defense Enclave Services contract by the Defense Information Systems Agency. The DES contract is a 10-year digital modernization program focused on consolidating common IT services into a single-service provider framework.  As expected, this award is now in protest with a GAO schedule to decide in mid June. One of the keys to our BD success is our strategic partnerships, including with Amazon Web Services. I am proud that Leidos was awarded the AWS 2021 public sector consulting partner of the year. AWS recognized Leidos with this honor because of our deep technical partnerships in areas such as edge to cloud and next-generation digital infrastructures to build solutions that drive digital and cloud transformation.  This recognition illustrates the value of the Leidos Alliance Partner Network, which we founded in 2018, to deepen relationships with the most important vendor partners across our business groups. This network has fostered greater collaboration with partners to drive technology innovations and continues to be a differentiator for Leidos on a wide range of proposals and programs. Number 3, I view capital allocation as one of the keys to creating shareholder value. Last quarter, we talked about a greater focus in 2022 on share repurchase. And we followed through with a $500 million accelerated share repurchase.  We set near our target leverage ratio and our ability to generate cash gives us significant firepower for further capital deployment. We're well-positioned to grow and will continue to look for technology add - ons and strategic initiatives, that bring us differentiated capabilities for customer access. We'll pursue large M&A only for a company that truly accelerates our strategy. 4. People are at the heart of what we do. And this quarter, we hired more than 2,600 people. One reason people are attracted to Leidos is, that we enable our employees to build successful careers. We regularly review talent and plan development actions at all levels of the company.  This quarter, we made several key moves at the Executive Leadership team and Board levels. We're pleased to welcome our new Chief Human Resources Officer, Maureen Watterson, who brings an impressive background and skill set to the Leidos team. Her excitement and commitment will enhance our people experience here at Leidos with about 1,600 funded vacancies and an industry-wide shortage of cleared technical talent, recruiting and retention remains areas of strategic focus. Maureen, will lead our human capital strategy and continue shaping the employee journey at Leidos through our Leidos Life Initiative. Dave King has decided to step back from his role, as Dynetics Group President. He will continue in a consulting capacity, ensuring a smooth change to new leadership and advising on matters of strategic importance. I want to thank Dave for his outstanding contributions thus far, and I look forward to working with him in his new capacity. Dave's Deputy Steve Cook is stepping up as Dynetics Group President. Steve's extensive experience and background, both with Dynetics for 13 years and leading critical programs for NASA before that, have prepared him well for his new role. He'll team with Paul Angola as his deputy.  In addition, Paul will lead the national security space business for Leidos with a focus on space surveillance, missile warning, and space situation awareness. Next, our digital modernization business is growing rapidly with an expanding portfolio of differentiated technology. To meet the demands of our growing business, Steve Hall (ph) will move from his role as CIO to lead the enterprise and cyber solutions operation within the defense group. We've moved our CIO team under Chief Technology Officer, Jim Carlini, to tightly align our technology and CIO capabilities. Finally, Pat Shanahan (ph) has joined our Board of Directors. He served at the highest levels of government, including Deputy Secretary Defense, and acting Secretary Defense and industry, including more than 30 years with Boeing, where he led supply chain and operations, commercial airplane programs, and many other relevant areas. While at DOD, he was a passionate champion of digital and technological advancement for the department, driving modernization in cyber security, AI, and cloud computing, as well as command, control, and communication.  Pat, wealth of expertise offers tremendous benefits for our shareholders and customers. Before turning the call over to Chris, I'd like to address the current congressional budget environment. Since the Q4 call, Congress passed the fiscal year 2022 omnibus spending package funding the federal government through the remainder of the fiscal year, with $782 billion in defense spending of 5.6 increase from fiscal year '21 and $730 billion in non-defense spending, a 6.7 increase from fiscal year '21. The budget also includes $14 billion in emergency supplemental spending in support of Ukraine given the devastation at the hands of the Russians. It will take time for the new budgets to work their way individual programs and new opportunities. But this provides positive momentum for the back half of 2022 and into 2023, President Biden has also released his $5.8 trillion fiscal year 2023 budget request. This request includes $813 billion in defense spending and $769 billion in non-defense spending. In addition to kicking off the fiscal year '23 congressional budget process, Congress remains focused on finalizing a $10 billion bipartisan COVID-19 relief measures.  And passing legislation to increase American competitiveness with China. Congress also continues to grapple with rising inflation rates, strained energy markets, supply chain issues, and the conflict in Ukraine. In closing, our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine and our colleagues who have family and friends in the country. The United Nations estimates that more than 11 million people are displaced.  To help those impacted, we've made a significant donation to project hope to mobilize emergency teams and send medical supplies. The people of Ukraine have lost infrastructure that will take lifetimes to replace. When the war ends, it will only be the beginning of their struggle. I will now turn the call over to Chris Cage. Christopher Cage : Thanks, Roger. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. As Roger said, Q1 was an outstanding quarter across the board, and I'm proud of the team for delivering such strong operating performance. Let's jump right into the first quarter results, beginning with the income statement on Slide 5. Revenues for the quarter were $3.49 billion, up 5.4% compared to the prior-year quarter.  Revenues grew organically across all three reportable segments, given robust hiring and high labor utilization. Adjusted EBITDA was $358 million for the first quarter, which was down 8% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA margin decreased from 11.7% to 10.2% over the same period. Adjusted EBITDA was down primarily as a result of the $26 million net benefit related to the Mission Support Alliance joint venture recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, as well as a return to more normative indirect spending levels as we move past the pandemic. Non-GAAP net income was $223 million for the first quarter, which was down 10.4% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.58, down 8.6% compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. Interest expense was up $3 million year-over-year with the additional borrowing to fund the Gibbs & Cox acquisition and the $500 million accelerated share repurchase. The Non-GAAP estimated tax rate was 21.2%, which was in line with our expectations for the quarter, but below the projected 23% for the year.  The weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 140 million shares compared to 144 million in the prior-year quarter. Now, for an overview of our segment results in key drivers on Slide 6. Defense Solutions revenues increased by 4.6% compared to the prior-year quarter. The largest growth drivers were the engine and if pick ramps, which more than offset the completion of the human landing system-based contract within Dynetics and the end of our Afghan support contracts. Defense Solutions, Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter came in at 8.1%, which was down compared to the prior year quarter, as the result of higher investments on developmental programs.  Civil revenues increased 3.8% compared to the prior year quarter. The revenue increase was primarily driven by volume growth on existing programs, including the support to Hanford and the FAA, as well as our engineering support to commercial energy providers. Civil, Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.7% compared to 12% in the prior-year quarter. The decline in segment profitability was primarily attributable to the MSA gain in the prior period, as well as the write-down taken on a minority interest joint venture program. Health revenues increased by 10% compared to the prior-year quarter. We continue to benefit from the ramp on the Military and Family Life Counseling program and dim sum had a large year-over-year increase based on deployment timing. Health non-GAAP operating income margin was 19.2% compared to 18.6% in the prior year quarter. The improvement in segment profitability was primarily attributable to efficiencies introduced into procurement and delivery on certain contracts.  As we've discussed previously, we expect Health segment margins to land in the mid-teens for the year. Turning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 7. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $93 million and free cash flow, which is net of capital expenditures, was $65 million. During the first quarter, we returned $577 million to shareholders, principally through the $500 million accelerated share repurchase program that we put in place two days after our February earnings call. We were immediately able to retire 4.5 million shares.  The program will end within the next two weeks, and if our share price remains relatively constant, we'll retire another few hundred thousand shares at that time. We're funding the ASR with a combination of cash on-hand and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. When the Russians invaded Ukraine, the CP market became more volatile so we sold some accounts receivable for short-term liquidity. Since then, CP markets have cleared and we've exited the AR monetization by quarter-end, so there was no impact on cash flow for the quarter. At quarter-end, we still had about $75 million of borrowings outstanding through our commercial paper program. As of April first 2022, we had $297 million in cash and cash equivalents and $5.1 billion of debt.  We remain committed to a target leverage ratio of three times, our long-term balanced capital deployment strategy remains the same and consists of being appropriately levered and maintaining our investment-grade rating, returning a quarterly dividend to our shareholders, reinvesting for growth, both organically and inorganically, and returning excess cash to shareholders in a tax efficient manner.  On now, to the forward outlook, as shown on Slide 8, we are maintaining our guidance for fiscal year 2022. Specifically, we expect revenues between $13.9 billion and $14.3 billion adjusted EBITDA margins between 10.3 and 10.5% non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $6.10 and $6.50 and cash from operations of $1 billion or greater. With three quarters to go, we believe the current ranges still encompass the likely outcomes for the year. That said, I will offer a few comments to help with modeling. On last quarter's call, I mentioned a range of EPS benefits from share repurchases. When we were implementing the plan, our stock was trading in the mid '80s. We're now forecasting a volume weighted average share price of around $105. In addition, with world events, interest rates have risen and liquidity has tightened, which has increased borrowing costs.  Given these factors, we are now projecting the addition from the Q1 ASR program to be closer to $0.10 than $0.20. In addition, we see the current environment is favorable towards growth, and we're exploring multiple opportunities where prudent investments could pay long-term benefits to Leidos and our shareholders. These increased investments may come in Business Development, R&D, and program execution. Finally, as Roger mentioned, we remain on track to generate a billion dollars of operating cash flow. As is our usual pattern, we expect the lion's share of operating cash flow will be generated in the back half of the year.  We still believe that Congress will retroactively delay implementation of the new tax research costs, capitalization rules, given the number of members from both parties who have cosigned legislation to restore pro innovation tax policy before the end of the year. However, if we were to amortize research costs and pay the taxes currently required, our operating cash flow target will be lower by approximately a $150 million. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob so we can take some questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Thank you. Our first question will be coming from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Peter Arment : Good morning, Roger and Chris. Roger Krone : Good morning, Peter. Peter Arment : Roger, maybe you could talk a little bit about, how you're seeing the fiscal '22 enacted came in and certainly the outlook for '23 looks even better for when we're talking about the longer-term budgets. Just kind of in the context of how you think Leidos is fairing there. And when I think about, just also the Dynetics business and you talked a lot about the program and records, the outlook there. If you could give any kind of insight and is there any potential benefit from activity in Ukraine? I know you do have some area defense type products where you envision benefit. Roger Krone : Peter, you broke up in the last sentence or two. Peter Arment : Just regarding Ukraine. Roger Krone : Yes, okay, great. Peter Arment : Is there any opportunity there when I know you have some Area Defense products? Roger Krone : Yes, let me talk in general. First of all, on Ukraine. Yes, we're probably seeing higher op tempo in our defense sector because of support that the U.S. is giving to the effort and the supplemental spending. But that being said, the conflict I think long term is probably bad for the industry. We're not in the business of war, we're in the business of providing a deterrent and so I think it's -- we will spend money now, but we will take it away from the future, and I think it's also bad for the country.  Certainly bad, I think, for Europe, and I think it's really bad for the global community. We're seeing more stratification of nations and going back to a tripolar world, and I'm not sure that's really good for anyone. That being said, we've probably worked more overtime, which meant our cost probably went down because we've got more direct labor that we didn't plan for.  And yes, there are some programs that appear to be accelerated because of some of the emerging threats that were used in Ukraine, hypersonics comes to mind. But we have the Indirect Fires program, which we expect to be fully supported. And then, to the extent that anybody is in the weapons business and we don't have a significant weapons business, but some of our peers that make [Indiscernible] and switchblades and javelins and things like that, and those inventories and that stock will have to be replenished. I think the broader view is, every time I think we as a country get comfortable that we can lower the defense budget because if you will, peace is broken out across the world. We learned that the world is still a very complicated place and we end up having to put the money back in the defense budget. So I think the long term prospect is that we will see a strong defense budget for the foreseeable future.  And what's especially good for us at Leidos is as the defense budget has moved up, there's now seems to be almost like an iron bar between the defense side and the civil side. So we rarely now are seeing increase on the defense side without a commensurate increase in the civil side, which really provides us a benefit across all of our segments. And so now I will, as a citizen, as a tax payer, I worry about the national debt and I worry about balancing the budget someday and all of that. But from my position as CEO, this has all been a real positive for the company and for Leidos and the strategy that we implemented, which was to be able to address the broad markets within the federal government.  And some of the international government. So as I said in my comments, we'll see the money start to come through that PBB system in the second half of '22 and then '23 looks like it's going to be another strong year on both sides. And frankly, '24 will follow. I just think we're at a place relative to government spending. That's going to favor our industry. So thanks for your question, Peter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu (ph) with Jefferies. Proceed with your questions. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Morning Roger, Chris. Thank you. Christopher Cage : Good morning, Sheila. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Morning. Good quarter. Chris, you mentioned in your comments, R&D investment in program execution investment if need be, was this regard to specific program with does or is it broader? And just in regards to profitability for the year, are you seeing costs come back or how do we see the cadence of profitability? Does it step up from Q1 levels? Christopher Cage : Right. Thanks, Sheila. So it's more than a singular program. In fact, it just been a variety of opportunities. And we encourage our teams to be creative and bring forward business cases, where they see opportunities that could lead to longer-term payoffs and we've seen a number of those opportunities. Some on programs that we're performing on, that were all in to make sure we deliver on time and on schedule and on budget. And so we believe those performance on those programs will lead to future opportunities with those customers.  That's one example, but there's also areas where we see next generation of certain technologies that we want to continue to invest in because we believe the demand will be there. As it relates to the pattern of profitability through the year, we always had an expectation that that would build, as we progress through the year for variety of factors. Some of which, just the timing that we have visibility into program performance, product deliveries or a little bit more back end loaded over the course of the year. Programs like maybe NextGen, which has been ramping up very nicely. There's more project work now that we're into that program, 6 plus months and the team sees opportunities, as we move to the back half of the year to continue to deliver for the Navy customer.  So I think the pattern with some modest increases over the course of the year and that will counterbalance some of the things that we're seeing in Health where the margins were a little bit inflated in the first quarter as you saw. But as far as the close on your indirect spending question, it's not a surprise to us. We certainly anticipated getting back, being on the road, being involved with trade shows as necessary. And so, as we built our pricing rates for the year, we certainly incorporated those expectations. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Roger Krone : Thank you. Christopher Cage : Thanks, Sheila. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Caivon Rumohr with Cowen. Please proceed with your questions. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Thanks so much. So like Khaki, you guys had a week funding to sales in the quarter per se, 0.9 although your trailing 12 of 1.01 is stronger. Can you give us some color on the cadence throughout the quarter in terms of funding and whether it's picked up here in April, and they're following onto that. Maybe some help in terms of the cadence of revenues and earnings over the next three quarters. Christopher Cage : Sure, Cai. It varies on the funding. And right now, I would tell you, other than one particular example that comes to mind where we wish there was a little bit more immediate funding on a particular program with one of our customers. Funding hasn't been an issue and some of the orders that we won, those notably on the VBA contracts, that funding will be there over time.  It just the way it gets recorded, so we don't see funding as an issue. And in fact, we're starting to see some customers come to us and say I'm anticipating more funding being available on these particular programs. What types of things could we potentially do? So that's the way we're seeing things play out. And I'm sorry, the second part of your question was on the progression of revenue and earnings? Cai von Rumohr : Yes, the progression of revenue and earnings over the year. Christopher Cage : Right. It's a modest uptick as we see the year playing out; obviously, we just got started. Roger talked about our AEGIS award program, so there was really no contribution of that in the first quarter. That will start to contribute more in the second and build through the second half of the year. There's obviously some other new start programs that we just talked about. One of the key variables will be within health and how we see the exam volume moderating, but we've certainly anticipated that coming back down to the more normative levels that we've discussed. Think about steady uptick in the run rate with the growth rate will moderate as you know the back half of last year was a little bit stronger, so you'll see those growth rates dial down. And that I think margin profile will continue modest increases over the course of the year. Roger Krone : Hey, Cai. I would add on the funding side. When we start some of these very, very large programs, getting the billing process where we aggregate bills and getting the contracting officer and that whole process to work as smoothly as it will on a mature program takes us a couple of cycles. And so it's not the available of funding at the customer level, it's getting the process of submitting invoices, aggregating invoices, and working with contracting officers, some of which are new to us because these are new programs, and just getting that process to operate as efficiently as we do on our more mature programs. So we expect as the year goes on, that you will see that reverse. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you. Christopher Cage : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Robert Spingarn : Hi, good morning. Roger Krone : Good morning. Christopher Cage : Hey Rob. Robert Spingarn : Roger, I wanted to ask on the SDA business where that's running and if that's improving with the traffic recovery. I think it was made -- it maybe trending at about, I don't know, 60% of where it was when you acquired it. Roger Krone : Lessee, there is more proposal activity and we're out on the road more, we're engaged with customers more. But like any acquisition process, when you essentially come to a stop, getting it started again so there's RFI, there's an RFP cycle and it just takes time. And air traffic in the U.S. is at or better than international is still lagging. And then in certain regions, there's still lagging, but our team is traveling again.  In fact, the Group President has been overseas talking to airports and the airports are now coming forward with new forward plans post COVID, which will include a modernization of both checkpoint baggage. And we've been investing in technology. We're trying to get to a touchless passenger experience, which I think is kind of the Holy Grail of all of us who want to go through airports. But that's just going to take time. So the recovery has been slow and it's going to take us well into '23 before we get back. Robert Spingarn : Okay. And can you remind us what the domestic versus international split is in that business? And then Chris, I have a quick one for you. Roger Krone : Rob, I don't know that we'd given a precise estimate of that. Because it ebbs and flows, right. Where the demand signal comes from in the service. But these days, it's less internationally focused a little bit more domestically focused. But to Roger's point, where we see that bounce back in that future demand will be more internationally focused when that does occur. Robert Spingarn : I'd probably should've asked it is installed base, maybe that's the better way to think about it? Roger Krone : We're going to test this now. More internal -- more installed base internationally. Robert Spingarn : Okay. And then Chris just on backlog, how much of that is fixed price and to what extent do those contracts have annual escalators like CPI or ECI to protect a bit? Christopher Cage : Well, the large awards in health this quarter are like a fixed unit rate pricing. And I would tell you, well we don't have necessarily escalator protection, we spent a lot of time in our pricing building in the forward rates and oftentimes those are prescriptive assumptions by the customer. And if things deviate, you have an opportunity to revisit that. But we take that estimate of inflationary cost increases into consideration we're building up our price on. As far as the overall, our fixed-price concentration hasn't moved much as a percent of revenue. So you're seeing the new orders come in along the same lines of what we've seen historically. Robert Spingarn : Okay. So no real change to your long-term margin expectations from inflation? Christopher Cage : No, not at this time. We're doing the best we can to come back that as we priced new opportunities and having still more than 50% cost plus mix in the portfolio certainly gives you some backstop installation, but we're certainly being thoughtful about pricing that the fixed price components of the new bids. Robert Spingarn : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Gavin Parsons with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Gavin Parsons : Hey, good morning. Roger Krone : Good morning, Gavin. Christopher Cage : Morning, Gavin. Gavin Parsons : Maybe just a follow on the inflation question. Roger, a couple of quarters ago, you made the point that the customer doesn't necessarily -- the customer will lose purchasing power if they don't raise their budgets for inflation. Seems like now we have a placeholder for inflation in the DoD Fiscal 23 budget. So, is it your sense that the government customer is cognizant of the inflation environment both in terms of real purchasing power and cost inputs? Christopher Cage : Well, let's see. It's hard for me to judge whether the government customer writ large, understands the complete impact of inflation versus a real growth in their budget. Certainly a variety of customers that we talk to. And I would point out, Gavin. The fuel cost is in immediate problem for, say, the Department of Defense, especially as they have increased op tempo and they have to buy the fuel comes out of the working capital fund. And so there are a variety of things that are happening in the macro economy that are going to cap down sort of the enthusiasm on the top-line increase. And I see -- my view is that at the SEC depth -- SEC depth level, they completely understand that. I don't think they're going to get supplemental for inflation. I think that they're thinking through the impact to the overall budget as they look at '23 and '24. But I also -- I'll just share with you what the rhetoric is around town here in Washington is that we will not sustain inflation at this rate. Is as we come out of the back of the pandemic, as we get to whatever normal is, and Ukraine, Roger Krone : Inflation will come down. Maybe not to pre - COVID levels, but won't sustain at this level. And I know there's a lot of focus on quarter-by-quarter of these numbers. But the economic -- economists that I talk to and the reports that I'm reading are that this will temper over the next quarter or two, back to a more normal level which will give them a little bit more real top-line Gavin Parsons : Okay. Appreciate that insight. And then maybe just in terms of reiterating guidance, seems like you've de -risked a lot of the risk factors that were originally in place when you guided. Could you talk a little bit about what the moving pieces are, that would take you towards the higher low end of the range for the year? Roger Krone : Yeah. I'll start and Chris can add. What we said is we're still within the range that we have put out in the marketplace, although they are obviously pluses and minuses. And I made a comment in my prepared remarks that a lot of risk has been retired and we have more confidence in our ability to meet our numbers for the year. But it's the first quarter, there's a lot of uncertainty. I don't know what's going to happen in Ukraine. And you should take away is that we're still bounded by our guidance.  But the team here is certainly a lot more confident than we were when we talk to you at first quarter, when we didn't have a budget, we didn't know about Defense Enclave Services. We hadn't gotten out of the ages of protest, so there's a lot of good things going on from a forecast standpoint within Leidos, but we're still clearly within our upper and lower balance in our guidance range. Christopher Cage : Yeah Gavin, that's certainly the thought process that we went through, and we're a lot -- we've learned from last year, things could evolve. The speed at which we think the positive budget environment flows through to orders we'll have to watch that carefully over here. The next couple of months. There's some exciting new programs that were -- we've been bidding on. And so depending upon those decision timings over the next two to three months could certainly be positive catalyst for us. But at this point in time, we're on a nice trajectory. We're still in, we believe the overall ranges for the year and so it was premature to think about changing that at this time. Gavin Parsons : Makes sense. Thank you. Roger Krone : Thanks, Gavin. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much. Good morning. Roger Krone : Good morning, Seth. Seth Seifman : Just wanted to start off with health and the profitability there and I know that nearly 20% is not necessarily a normalized margin, but if it's better than what was a very high-margin last year, I guess. How should we think about what's going to cause that to decline? Saw there was a win on the medical exam contract in the quarter. You'd probably have a little bit more visibility there. Were medical exams down year-on-year and the margin rate still went up? And if so, what drove that and do the drivers give you an ability to, maybe, sustain something that's closer to high cans? Christopher Cage : Yes. So let me start and Roger can pile on. So for the first quarter, we're not featuring the exam businesses, the primary driver for strong margins. I have to give it to the dim sum team. They're just doing an excellent job and we saw, again as they've deployed more, they're seeing more efficiencies. And we talked about procurement and delivery in our prepared remarks. How we're delivering software for the customer, finding opportunities to get more efficient and doing so. So that one really helped contribute in the quarter.  That was a little bit of a onetime pickup, but actually it will help us on ongoing basis maintain a little bit. Margin profile there. The exam business is doing well. I would say largely about the same levels that where we were a year ago. And I think if you read carefully our prepared remarks, we talked about two things. Number 1, we're excited to have won a position internationally, which provides opportunity to expand that business in an area we haven't been before.  On the flip side, on one of our regions, one of the areas we perform on, we were re-awarded that contract, but they also added a couple additional suppliers, potentially to the mix. We don't know how that dynamic will play out as far as how the case load gets distributed there, so that's certainly an area that we'll have to watch and moderate and could potentially we're anticipating will put some downward pressure on margins over the course of the year, but we'll have to wait and see. Roger Krone : Yeah, Seth, Christopher Cage : I'll just add a little bit of colors of the number of exams we do per day, per week, maintained strong through the period. The discussions that we've had with the customer is there is a potential this year and next year that they will go back and review. So what they call prior presumptive cases, things related to [Indiscernible] and some other things that might sustain the volume of -- in the exam business sort of above what we have forecasted. We've had those discussions with the customers. We haven't seen the volume come all the way through yet, so it's a bit of wait and see. And on the district six, which is your transition exam when you lead the active military and you go to VA. They added another -- actually added two more contractors because of the anticipation that there will be added volume through this presumptive cases. And we can talk more about it as the quarters go by, but it's really, really important for our customer to provide a timely medical exam to the people who served the country. And so they want to add more capacity into the system because I think we'll have more exams and we'll just have to wait and see how it plays out. Seth Seifman : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then, just as a quick follow-up. It seems like the company is in a pretty strong place with regard to the revenue outlook for the year. With regard to the margin guidance, it seems that margin rates had expand through the year, but health has probably had an unsustainable level in Q1, and you talked about some more investments. So what's the driver of in improving margin rate? Christopher Cage : There's a variety of things, Seth. Well, first of all, on the investment questions, if we see smart investments, we believe for the long term we're going to fund those even if they were over and above the plan. But as of right now, obviously, we are holding to our guidance. I talked about some of the product deliveries, although as Roger alluded to, the SDA business is not where we ultimately hope it will be. We are still shipping some products and those are more back-end loaded over the course of the year. We'll be ramping up some new program wins.  That scale will continue to increase the engine. Project work is back-end loaded, and some of the projects that Dyne tics is working on in delivering we are anticipating a better performance over the back half of the year. There's a variety of factors across the portfolio. We're not far off obviously at [Indiscernible] margin. We're not far off of what our goals are, but you're right, and we're preparing for health moderating down in the other parts of the portfolio, moderating up a little bit this year. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much. Christopher Cage : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Bert Subin with Stifel, please proceed with your question. Bert Subin : Hey, good morning. Christopher Cage : Hey, good morning. Hey, Bert. Bert Subin : So following up on the SD&A question, Roger, you said last quarter normalization was something in the ballpark of several $100 million higher. So you could see up to or greater than a 2.0 organic tailwind for that business heading into 2023, could you not? Roger Krone : And without doing the math in my head -- Christopher Cage : Well, yes. It all bounced back overnight, right? We're not expecting that we'll get a step function increase, but that's where we think we'll ultimately be able to get back to. Bert Subin : Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. Can you just give us an update on where things stand with the hypersonic business? Roger Krone : Sure. We make the common hypersonic glide body down Dynetics in Huntsville and we have delivered our first Leidos manufacturer, common - hypersonic glide body to the customer. And we are ramping up production, I can't share what the production numbers are, but it's a fairly steep ramp. The program is fully funded. We also won -- we've talked about this in the past the thermal protection system contract. This is the coating that goes on the outside of the common - hypersonic glide body.  And so we're producing in manufacturing the thermal protection system. And I will say this, we have ample capacity to raise our rates significantly above what we're contracted for. And then we also makes the launcher, which is more associated with the parent program, though long-range hypersonic weapon. And we had delivered our first tranche of launchers in there with the army doing training.  And we're in a position to build additional launchers. And as those contracts get written, but we're excited about the program. We believe there is a huge near-term need, and although we're conservative in what we put in our financial forecast, we clearly think there's upside on the hypersonic business. Christopher Cage : But we're really excited but the team is doing a great job. In fact, Roger, myself, a few other executives are getting on a plane later today to fly down to Huntsville and celebrate some of the recent successes they've had because they're really knocking it out of the park. Bert Subin : Thanks, Roger. Thanks Chris. Operator : The next question is from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. Matthew Akers : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question, guys. Roger Krone : Hey. Good morning. Matthew Akers : I wanted to ask about -- good morning. I just wanted to ask about DAZ. And realizing that that programs still under protest. But assuming that does come back to you at some point later this year, how should we think about kind of the pacing of how fast that could ramp up? And ultimately, what's sort of the run rate we should expect on that program? Roger Krone : Yeah. Well, I'll give you an overview and then Chris can sharpen the numbers part of it. We're in protest. We're optimistic that the GAO rule on time, it clearly could go to another round of protest. Should go to the quarter Federal Claims. But it is a very slow ramp. So let me describe the program is, this is -- this are taking over more IT environment to come to if you will, a common network approach across, DOD. And so we will transform networks of other DOD agencies outside of the services and this happens agency by agency basis.  The first couple agencies that we will transform are relatively small. If we come out of a protest in June, the revenue this year is very small. Almost double-digit but not much more than that. And then it builds over time. I would caution dividing 11.5 by 10 and putting a billion-dollar in your model. We have to win and achieve that. I mean, there is a potential to do that several years out, but it's not at that level in our models.  It's smaller than that. That's an IDIQ ceiling. If you're familiar on how that contract works, that gives the customer room to grow in to spend at that level. But from our own internal modeling, it will be a slow ramp and we'll actually take years to become a significant program at that level. Christopher Cage : I mean, Matt, I'm probably going to dodge your question even more. Obviously, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Very excited to get the win notification, have a high degree of confidence in our team. They know how to defend protests. And so we're going to go through that process. We're going to see what happens in June. And to Roger's point, I feel like this is a program that will continue to drive growth for multiple years. That's the good news and we'll do everything we can to deliver for the customer, maximize the value of the contract, because that means we're really delivering great capability to up to 22 agencies within the DoD Fourth Estate. But think about this potentially, it will become, we believe, one of our top programs but don't expect that in '23 and probably not in '24. It will take multiple years to get there. Matthew Akers : Got it. Thanks, that's helpful. And then if I could just do one more on kind of the hiring environment and you guys have had won a lot of new work here. What are you seeing? Is it getting any easier to hire people? And are you confident you can get enough people to support all this new work? Christopher Cage : It's really interesting. We're People Company and clearly, every day, almost every hour we're talking about people and hiring. And the great resignation, unquote means people are moving. And if they're resigning from Leidos that are going to work someplace else, if the resigning from someplace else, they are coming to work at Leidos. So our accepts are in the 90% of the offers that we make. We fill most of our positions between 30 and 45 days. So it's not a hiring problem, it's a retention problem. And we all have. I've got kids and coming out of COVID people are looking around. They want to try something different and so we're doing a lot.  If you were in our meetings we have a great talent acquisition team. They are doing a great job and we can always do better. But we're spending a lot of our time on how we continue to make Leidos an attractive place not to come to work, but to stay. And so this is career development, this is investing in the future of our employees. This what we call upskilling, teach them new languages like Python and things like that so that they can have a new job and stay at Leidos, if you will. And there's a lot of work and I know I was talking to some of our competitors and they have the same problem and we're all focusing on employee development.  Not so much from a hiring standpoint. But where there's always a shortage of cleared computer science majors, you're with access in the Intel world, that's always going to be a challenge. But you should not -- you listened about the great resignations or they can't hire the people. We've been very, very successful in attracting and hiring. And now our emphasis is on retention. Matthew Akers : That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Colin Canfield with Barclays, please proceed with your questions. Colin Canfield : Hey, good morning. [Indiscernible] the growth this year. Unchanged guidance suggests that you need to hit roughly 7% organic, that's like 23, 24. So then as we look out over a multi-year period, what are some of the pain points that you guys are looking at split between headcount issues, supply chain? Really, what does it take to not achieve those levels? Christopher Cage : Well, Colin, over a multiyear time horizon things can go wrong and we've been talking about some of them here that Roger just feature of retention. So it's not a hiring issue per se, it's certainly for making sure we can retain people to have the headcount, we need to achieve that level of growth. First of all, we put that multiyear guidance out in October. We knew when we put this year's guidance out that we were on the lower end of the range.  We're off to a good start. We're not updating this year's guidance at this point in time. But we just talked about things like DES and catalyst for future momentum. So then it becomes, can you execute? Can you get the people on the supply chain? So we're watching all those things very carefully. All indicators at this point in time are nothing would take us away from feeling like we can still achieve those longer-term objectives. So that's the trajectory we're on. But clearly something we focus on all the time as we go through and execute and deliver for our customers every day. Roger Krone : And Colin, there's still some big opportunities we have to win. We've talked about the FENS program, which now been delayed to the fall and there are a series of multi-billion-dollar programs that are still in our pipeline. So we have to continue to do overdoing, hire the people, execute in the business development area, win the programs and in staff, the programs.  And then the customer has to fully fund. And right now, I think '22 and '23 looked pretty solid. But if there is a big sea chain, frankly, if we get into a war where the U.S. is actually involved, that we'll re-prioritize spending within the federal government. Maybe a way from long-term modernization to actual combat operations. We're hopeful that won't happen, but that could have a significant effect on how we view the future. Colin Canfield : Got it. And then in terms of CapEx for the year, can you just discuss some of your biggest investment areas and the return metrics that you're contemplating within that portfolio? Christopher Cage : Yes. When we put together our CapEx plan for the year, all of our business have a variety of needs and there's a laundry list of items. Some of the bigger ones were in the airborne ISR business, and that's an area we've made some investments and generated excellent returns with IRRs. Certainly, mid to high teens, if not better. We certainly look at the risks of an investment, we look at our weighted average cost of capital, and we tried to generate returns, obviously, that exceed that. And we are still putting money into -- as much as we're trying to overall strength and densify our facility footprint. There are certain areas, especially in the intel space, new classified facilities we're having to invest in some areas on the manufacturing side that we're investing. And so facilities will probably be our second biggest expense area and then it's just a variety of smaller initiatives across the company. Roger Krone : Rob, it looks like we have time for just one more question. Operator : Yes. That question is coming from the line of Mariana Perez Mora of Bank of America. Mariana Perez Mora : Good morning, gentlemen. Roger Krone : Morning. Christopher Cage : Morning. Mariana Perez Mora : My question is a follow up to Cai's question. As we try to understand the market trends versus the company-specific story, would you mind giving us some color on how much of the 4% organic growth or how much of like the low-single-digits organic growth from better or implied in here, in our guidance is related to legacy programs. How much is related to new on ramping up contracts, and how much is related to loss re-compete. Christopher Cage : Loss re-compete. So you're talking about Mariana, our organic growth profile, and kind of dissecting that a little bit is what I think I heard from that question, we're certainly seeing some uplift and we look for what we call on-contract growth every year as we build our plan between inflationary pressures on cost reimbursable programs and just because there's capacity within contract budgets that we look for opportunities to continue to expand services to existing customers.  That's certainly an area that's contributing a couple of points of growth. At a minimum, we look for that and then obviously comes down to the New Star programs. We've talked, featured many of those. Engine will still be a growth story for us this year. Military Family Life Counseling continues to ramp up. We talked about aegis. So some of those new mega programs are probably the next thing I would point to, to give us confidence on this year's growth trajectory. And then Roger just talked about the pipeline is still rich and we're continuing to pursue multiple programs beyond that to fuel our growth. I'm not sure if that exactly hit on your question, but happy to expand as necessary. Mariana Perez Mora : Now, that's good color. And then, outreach through M&A, could you mind giving us some color on watching the pipeline in terms of how we are today and what companies, customers, capabilities are you looking for on those packing or bolt-on acquisitions? Christopher Cage : Well, Mariana, we won't give you too much in the way of specifics as far as what we're looking at in the M&A arena, but I would tell you that a lot of properties continue to come to market. Roger talked last quarter about and followed up again this quarter, the mega properties, the larger ones are probably not something we have an immediate interest in unless we really saw a compelling case to accelerate our strategy. We're certainly seeing some companies out of the space arena come to market. That's interesting to follow. But we look at things that makes sense to us. We bet things, but we're going to be thoughtful about where we engage, and back to his prepared remarks, it really has to fit a strategy niche for us. Roger Krone : Yeah, Mariana, I would just foot stomp. We're really happy with our portfolio today, and so we look at M&A as a way to accelerate technology or customer access or relationship with a customer. We were fortunate to be able to do some larger transactions early, and it rounded out our portfolio. And now as we see technology advance, there's always a couple areas where I think our time-to-market would be benefited by partnering with a company rather than trying to develop that internally.  And then there are still customers in the federal space that we don't have a long term relationship with, and so if we're able to accelerate that relationship through another company that has a great portfolio will do that. Otherwise, as we said in our capital allocation, we're really thinking about how we get value back to you, our shareholders. So thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the floor back over to Stuart Davis for closing remarks. Stuart Davis : Thank you, Rob, for your assistance on this morning's call and thank you all for your time this morning and your interest in Leidos. We look forward to updating you again soon. Have a great day. Operator : This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions] Please note, that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll now turn the conference over to Stuart Davis, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Davis, you may begin. Stuart Davis : Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our second quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; and Chris Cage, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you'll also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll use during today's call. Turning to slide two of the presentation. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, as shown on slide three, during the call we'll discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in today's press release and presentation slides. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone, who will begin on slide four. Roger Krone : Thank you, Stuart, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Leidos remains on track for another year of solid organic growth and core business profitability. The affirmation of our Defense Enclave Services contract award by the Government Accountability Office demonstrates our leadership in digital modernization across the federal government, with strong demand for our technology solutions and services across our diversified business portfolio. We continue to execute on our disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy to drive shareholder value. And we are proving our ability to compete successfully for talent with another quarter of robust hiring. I'll now expand on these four points. Number one, our financial performance for the quarter was strong, ahead of consensus at both the top and bottom lines. Revenues of $3.6 billion were up 4.3% in total and up 4% organically year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was also up 5% to $1.59, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.2%. We also generated $40 million of cash flow from operations and are on track to generate at least $1 billion of operating cash flow this year. Number two, our business development results demonstrate our strong positioning in the government technology marketplace. We achieved net bookings of $2.2 billion in the quarter, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 0.6. Over the past 12 months, net bookings are $15.4 billion and book-to-bill is 1.1. Total backlog at the end of the quarter stood at $34.7 billion, which was up 4% year-over-year with funded backlog of $7.5 billion, up 5%. On a constant currency basis, backlog was $268 million higher. You can read about some of our awards in the press release, but let me highlight a few developments in the quarter. Most importantly the GAO affirmed $11.4 billion DES award to Leidos. We'll support DISA's mission by consolidating enterprise IT services at a global scale and by providing standardized responsive and cost-effective solutions. This program should have a several year runway of growing revenue and expanding profitability, but will not add materially to the 2022 revenue or earnings. We also had an outstanding outcome on our Social Security Administration position. The SSA recompeted all of the work under its primary IT services IDIQ known as ITSSC-2 in two task orders. And we significantly expanded our role. We were the sole large business awardee on both task orders. On the first, we'll modernize and manage the SSA's IT infrastructure, including data center, data operations, networks telecommunications, cloud, and user services. And all of this is new work for us. On the second, we'll now perform all of the software development and mission application work that we previously split with other providers. As expected, both of the awards were protested last week. But should we prevail, we could double our revenue at SSA and make ITSSC2 a top 10 program. Finally, we've seen some initial indications of an improving airport screening landscape. We were selected by the Dominican Republic's, Punta Cana International Airport to upgrade both people and baggage screening at all security lanes within the Terminal B checkpoint. In addition, bid volume and bid scale has increased meaningfully when compared to the first half of 2021. And we're getting great feedback on our ability to differentiate our offerings by bringing broader Leidos capabilities like cyber protection. Although, we're not expecting a full recovery in the airport screening business until 2024, it's good to see some positive trends here. That said, the overall bookings environment has been challenging, as procurement time lines continue to extend. DoD outlays for example are down 2% this government fiscal year-to-date compared to fiscal year 2021, despite a higher budget. Still, our book-to-bill ratio, understates the true strength of the business development performance in the quarter, as it includes nothing for DES, and the protested SSA awards. Our win rates and summit volumes remain high and we expect procurements will pick up to match the improved budget environment. Number three. Our approach to capital allocation is a core part of our investment thesis. We've talked about being appropriately levered and maintaining our investment-grade rating, returning a quarterly dividend, reinvesting for growth, both organically and inorganically and returning excess cash to shareholders in a tax-efficient manner. And we're doing all of that. In Q1, we executed a $500 million accelerated share repurchase. And we've just entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Cobham Aviation Services, Australia's Aviation Special Mission business for about US$215 million. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions and we expect to close by the end of the year. We expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to non-GAAP EPS. The business owns and operates 14 modified aircraft, providing border force airborne surveillance and maritime safety search and rescue to the Australian Federal Government and a critical element of Australia's national security. This acquisition diversifies our Australian portfolio into capability and mission services work, with both the Defense Maritime and Homeland Affairs programs. Finally, integration risk is manageable, because airborne surveillance is what we know how to do well and we already have strong local leadership and infrastructure to support success. Number four, Leidos is an attractive destination for talented people. In the second quarter, we hired nearly 3,600 people, a number we've only surpassed once in five years. And that's when we were simultaneously staffing the Navy NGEN program and the Military and Family Life Counseling program. Year-to-date, we've hired more than 6,200 people. Quarter-after-quarter, we demonstrated that talent acquisition is a core Leido's strength. On the Q1 call, we talked about challenges around retention. Competition for talent remains high as critical skills for us, such as software engineers and developers are in demand by both tech and non-tech companies. Even though voluntary attrition seems to have peaked, we remain focused on keeping engaged with our people. In fact, our June leadership offsite was focused on retention and we're now implementing many of the ideas that came out of that session. Before turning it over to Chris, let me touch on the federal budget landscape. The House and Senate Armed Services committees approved versions of the Fiscal Year '23 National Defense Authorization Act. Both of which recommended healthy increases to the President's request. Congress fully recognizes the urgency of investing in our national security in the face of global security threats. The fiscal year '23 appropriations process is also underway which should result in significant nominal increases to 2022 levels, but we expect that the government will begin the fiscal year with a continuing resolution that should be resolved before the end of the 116th Congress. And finally, I'm pleased to announce that we'll be hosting an investor site visit at Dynetics in Huntsville Alabama this fall. Dynetics is an important part of our value proposition for investors and a key differentiator for us in the marketplace. The event will start with a dinner with the leadership team on November 30th with a mix of briefings tours of the production facilities and Q&A with the team on December 1.  Expect to come away with a much better understanding of the culture and key growth drivers for Dynetics including the Hypersonic's, Indirect Fire Protection Capability and space-based missile defense programs. Please reach out to Stuart if you're interested in attending. I'll now turn the call over to Chris. Chris Cage : Thanks Roger and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Second quarter results were very positive overall. And there are a number of moving pieces I want to cover this morning, starting with the income statement on Slide 5. Revenues for the quarter were $3.6 billion, up 4.3% compared to the prior year quarter. Revenues grew organically across all three reportable segments, given robust hiring and our recent program wins. Adjusted EBITDA was $366 million for the second quarter which was up 1.9% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA margin decreased from 10.4% to 10.2% over the same period. Non-GAAP net income was $220 million for the second quarter which was up immaterially year-over-year. And non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.59 up 5% compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. The performance of the base business is solid and stable. A couple of factors below EBITDA that drive EPS are worth noting. Net interest expense increased to $50 million from $46 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 with higher borrowing and the rise in interest rates. The weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 138 million compared to 143 million in the prior year quarter. The current share count benefits from the retirement of 300,000 shares as part of the final settlement of the ASR program.  Now for an overview of our segment results and key drivers on Slide Six. Defense Solutions revenues increased by 2.4% compared to the prior year quarter. The largest growth drivers were the NGEN and IFPC ramps which more than offset the end of our Afghanistan support contracts and reduced material purchases supporting hypersonics programs. In addition, the strengthening dollar represented about a $24 million year-over-year headwind for our UK and Australia businesses which lowered the segment growth rate by about a 1 point. Defense Solutions non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter came in at 8.3% which was unchanged compared to the prior year quarter. Civil revenues increased 7.3% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by the start-up of the NASA AEGIS program and increased demand on existing programs, including the support to Hanford and our engineering support to commercial energy providers. Civil non-GAAP operating income margin was 6.5% compared to 9.1% in the prior year quarter as a result of an adverse arbitration ruling which led to $17 million of additional expense, related to a dispute arising out of the acquisition of the IS&GS business from Lockheed Martin in 2016. Excluding this arbitration write-down, Civil margins would have been up sequentially to 8.5%. Health revenues increased 6.7% over the prior year quarter. We continue to benefit from the ramp on the Military and Family Life Counseling program and DHMSM had a nice year-over-year increase based on the deployment timing. In addition, we had a $28 million equitable adjustment to cover costs incurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic which caused non-GAAP operating margin to improve to 19.8% from 17.8% in the prior year quarter. We had originally anticipated to receive this payment in the second half of the year, so we're pleased to resolve this matter earlier than expected. Turning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on slide 7, operating cash flow for the quarter was $40 million and free cash flow which is net of capital expenditures was $19 million. While DSOs in the quarter came down two days sequentially to 61, $110 million of collections that we anticipated in Q2 came in during the first week of July. We're targeting another three days of DSO improvement over the back half of the year which is consistent with our historical pattern. During the second quarter we returned $51 million to shareholders, primarily through our ongoing dividend program. We also rolled over the $380 million term loan related to the Gibbs & Cox acquisition that came due in May. At the end of the quarter we had $339 million in cash and cash equivalents and $5.2 billion in debt, including $150 million of commercial paper notes outstanding. The purchase price for the Cobham Aviation Special Mission acquisition was AUD310 million, which we hedge to lock us in at the $215 million purchase price that Roger quoted. With that acquisition we expect 2022 will follow our standard capital allocation approach with the balance of organic and inorganic growth investments, dividends, share repurchases against the backdrop of a leverage ratio trending towards three times. On to the forward outlook, as shown on slide 8 we're maintaining our guidance ranges for fiscal year 2022. The guidance does not include the impact of the Australian Aviation acquisition which should be relatively small for this year. Taking a big picture view, when we put together our plan for 2022, we had expected to build momentum through the year. Our guidance calls for the second half to be more in line with the first half from a revenue, EPS and EBITDA perspective. Part of that shift is driven by over performance in the first half. But there are a number of other factors that I'll address as I walk through the individual guidance elements. On revenues, we're ahead of where we expected coming into the year, stemming from the build-out of our recent wins and on-contract growth through trusted customer relationships. This gives us increased confidence in being in the upper half of the revenue range. Increased legal expenses and the unexpected arbitration ruling are pressuring EPS and EBITDA margin. And we're experiencing a larger-than-expected headwind from broader economic issues including foreign exchange rates and interest expense. In addition, we've had more margin dilution than anticipated from the start-up of some newer programs. Accordingly, it will be challenging to perform at or above the midpoint of the EPS and EBITDA margin ranges. Even though most of the cargo factors are transitory in nature we're taking actions on items within our control. We haven't changed our long-term view of margins. Finally, we're maintaining our operating cash flow guidance of at least $1 billion. The arbitration ruling will result in a $25 million cash payment. We'll have to offset that payment but I have confidence in our team's ability to deliver on the cash commitment. We continue to monitor the potential for Congress to act on the new tax research cost capitalization rules. At this time we do not expect to make any federal tax payments related to the amortization of research costs this year. If the 2022 effective date of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act research cost capitalization provision remains in place, we expect our income taxes payable and net deferred tax assets will each increase by approximately $150 million in fiscal 2022 and the related negative impact to cash will be realized in fiscal 2023. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob, so we can take some questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your questions. Peter Arment : Yes. Good morning, Roger and Chris. Hey, Roger I guess you gave us some high-level color on the budget in the backdrop. I was wondering if just the way you look at it a longer term we're seeing the plus-ups. Do you think just given the wins that you've had your ability to that -- revenues could actually begin to accelerate as we think about longer term picture? I know you're not giving 2023 guidance but I appreciate any color? Thanks. Roger Krone : Yeah. We're still really optimistic about the out years. We made the comment I think both Chris and I that long-term, we don't see anything that changes the conversation that we've had in the past. And frankly since we were all together in New York last fall, the budget environment actually has gotten better and better in the areas where we're focused and differentiated. So I am still very bullish on the future. Peter Arment : And then just as a quick follow-up. Anything to highlight in terms of the Dynetics program of record outlook? It seems like that was -- continues to be something I think that's gaining a lot of attention. Roger Krone : Well, it's really exciting across the board. The hypersonic programs strong support. We have actually three Enduring Fires program, one with the laser, one with a missile and one with a high-powered microwave. And those are all strongly supported. The space business, there's things that hopefully we'll be able to talk about next quarter that are really great developments there. And we are -- I don't want to overemphasize this, but we're really, really pleased with how that has worked out. And of course that's why we chose it for the visit in the fall. And I can't wait to walk you through the plant and let you meet some of the team down there. I think you'll be really excited too. Peter Arment : Appreciate the detail. Thanks. Roger Krone : Yeah. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Hey, good morning and thank you. Roger Krone : Hi. Good morning, Sheila. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning. Roger I appreciate your comments on talent hiring and your retention focus. When we look at your head count it was up 10% I believe year-over-year with organic growth of 4%. So maybe if you could square that disconnect for us a little bit. Roger Krone : We've got an emphasis to -- a little bit complicated. I'll try to make it very simple. Direct labor is really important to us. It's how we absorb lot of our costs. And so if we can have higher direct labor under the same revenue bucket that's a positive for us. So we're trying to increase the Leidos' content of the work we have across the board. Now I'll also tell you quarter-to-quarter month-to-month it's going to fluctuate. But we have a long-term effort to increase our content. And Sheila as you know significant part of our content is the work that our great people do every day. And so seeing headcount grow faster than revenue, we actually view that as a positive. That means we are implementing our strategy. And we're having success in attracting and retaining the people that we need to help us be successful. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay. Thank you. And then I wanted to ask about how the business has been very good. And maybe on two specific opportunities with burn pit currently facing some hurdles in the Senate, how do you think about that and how it could be potentially incremental to your VA medical business? And then the second with Cerner and their EHR Modernization program, it's currently paused again. What are your thoughts there and the opportunity for Leidos? Chris Cage : Yeah. Sheila this is Chris. I'll get started. Maybe Roger can comment on the VA program. Obviously, we're very pleased with the Health team and their ongoing performance. And we had told you in Q1 that we had won a recompete successfully that was critically important, although that there was an increased amount of competition introduced on that program. We also won some new work on international. So both of those dynamics are shaking their way out and we'll continue to see international ramp-up and we might see some pressure on the legacy side on the pre-discharge work. You talked about burn pit that's something we're watching very carefully. The team believes there is a significant increase in demand that will come from that. Obviously, we had hoped and expected that legislation would have passed by now. We're monitoring that daily, hourly and we hope to have some good news soon. So that's something that there is a modest amount of increased volume in the back half of the year associated with that coming through. And we think hopefully we'll be in a position where we could do better than that if things work through quickly. And Roger might comment on the VA. Roger Krone : Yes. And thanks Sheila. Obviously, we watch the VA program very closely. We have a relatively small role in supporting Cerner on the program. The movement of Cerner to Oracle, I think is going to be a positive for the program. Oracle is a real strong company, very strong software and data management. There's the Oracle Cloud. I think that will all be favorable for the VA. I know that they are paused while they reassess their go-forward plan. We stand ready to support Oracle, Cerner, the VA, any one of those organizations with the best of Leidos and frankly, members of our DHMSM team, and we'll just have to sit back and see how it develops. Again, I know they're paused. But the VA needs a single electronic healthcare record system and they need the interoperability with the active military, and we're strongly supportive of both of those. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you very much. Roger Krone : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Please proceed with your questions. Robert Spingarn : Hey, good morning. Chris Cage : Good morning. Roger Krone : Good morning. Hey, Rob. Robert Spingarn : Roger, one thing that we're noticing with -- in your numbers today and also happened for Booz, but flat sequential sales in defense. And I wanted to ask, why we didn't see a sequential uptick from the March quarter to the June quarter, just given that the CR concluded in March? What's going on? Is it just slow acquisition activity out of the Pentagon? And why? Roger Krone : Yes. It is slow acquisition activity. It's a slow ramp on the programs that we've won. Of course, some of the programs that we won got protested, so they got pushed further into the year. Outlays are actually down. And I really can't -- I can't tell you why -- what's going on in the acquisition in the Pentagon, although we do talk to the Pentagon officials, head of Acquisition head of Research. They fully intend to spend the money. And they've got the money authorized and appropriated. I think they're a little bit like everyone that a lot of their talent retired. They're still working remote. So things are just taking longer. And then, something that's really important to us is, what we call special project work on a lot of our contracts. This is where we have a base contract with a defined statement of work and the customer says, gosh, why you're doing that? Well, could you do these other things? That's really beneficial to us, both from a top line and a bottom line. And that project work got delayed because of the budget uncertainty. And we're optimistic that we'll see more of that in the second half of the year. But we're cautious to forecast it, as you noticed in Chris' remarks. So I think overall there's good news. I think short-term, it's just kind of getting the machine, running again and getting them to spend the money. Robert Spingarn : Well, just on the back of that, is there anything particular about the types of awards that are being delayed or the size that are being delayed? Is it more common for larger awards and task orders to be delayed? Roger Krone : It was a good question. I'm kind of thinking of -- looking at Chris and... Chris Cage : I think that's typically what we would see, the larger, more complicated to evaluate, multiple competitors, longer EM, evaluation process. I think the -- where we do best is on-contract growth on existing vehicles. There's no competition. And again, there's hope that we'll see more of that come through in this -- in the fall quarter leading up the government fiscal year-end. But the more complicated procurements -- and you've seen that. I mean different agencies are different, but we've seen more consolidation into larger vehicles is often the case. And so those things can tend to push out the procurement cycle. Robert Spingarn : Yes. Okay. Roger Krone : Yes. And Rob, I would comment. And this is an absolute, but if a program is over $1 billion, I think the customer runs the acquisition process with the knowledge that there'll be a protest. So I think in both peer review and in writing the acquisition opinion and the sourcing letter, I think they're taking more time to get it right to either avoid the protest, which obviously hasn't been happening or to ensure that the award will be upheld. We've got protested again. It happens to us almost every quarter now in our large social security win. And I think in the government that they are now kind of like a protest is almost the normal and the bigger the program, the more likely the protest. Robert Spingarn : Okay. That's very helpful. I just wanted to ask you a clarification on the hiring. You said attrition is coming down. Is that because fewer people are going into the tech \u2013 that tech hiring is slowing I guess the best way to ask it. Roger Krone : Yes. Of course, I mean you and I are both speculating on why. I think there's a concern about the economy. Some of big tech has slowed their hiring. Some big tech has actually announced some layoffs. It's the summer and just a lot of people are on vacation or not. There is sort of a cycle and a seasonality to when people leave and when people stay. Very few people leave before like incentive awards are made in March. And I hope we're seeing a change in our long-term trend. But we've all been here before. It could spike back. We are still not back to pre-COVID levels. So although, we have started to see some moderation in attrition which I view as favorable but I do worry a little bit about the economy. And I'm not forecasting recession but I am forecasting maybe a little toning down in growth. So \u2013 and I think for a lot of people we have great jobs. We have great work. I mean we pay really great salaries. We have really cool stuff to do and we're able to attract some really great people. And I think once they get here and they start doing some of the fantastic stuff that we do, they go gosh, I want to do that. And that has that message has gotten through to our employees and I think we benefited from that. Robert Spingarn : Very helpful. Thank you. Roger Krone : Yes. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Gavin Parsons with Goldman Sachs. Gavin Parsons : Hey, good morning. Roger Krone : Good morning, Gavin. Gavin Parsons : Roger, I think you said you didn't book anything for DES. But just any update on your expectations for what that ramp could look like or how much that could contribute in the future and whether or not that could ultimately be a top 10 program? Roger Krone : Yes. And DES, we've been turned on for the first task quarter which is very small. We are \u2013 let me spend at least 15, 20 seconds to describe the program. So in DES we work with DISA to create a common architecture called DoD ONE-Net. And once we've established that architecture then we will migrate 20-some-odd federal agencies to the new architecture. So the first thing we have to do is partner with our customer and define the architecture. And that is really hard work but a small number of people working in partnership with a DISA customer. And that's going to go on for months. So it's going to be really low. I don't think we put numbers out. But as I think I said not significant impact to top line or bottom line. Next year right, we started to do migrations. And then in the third year we do even more migration. So \u2013 and again I think we said this last quarter is that when we clear it \u2013 it was going to be a very slow ramp. But then it will ramp into a significant program. Whether we'll ever achieve the IDIQ value of $11.5 billion I guess we'll have to tune in 10 years from now. It has the potential to do that because we believe the architecture and the cost savings and the increased cybersecurity and the efficiency of this new DoD ONE-Net will be so advantageous to the government customers that people will want to migrate maybe even more agencies over time. But it's going to take a while to get there. Gavin Parsons : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just in terms of margins. It looks like it was 9.9% in the quarter excluding the charges. Maybe if you could just give us kind of around the horn by segments what that looks like through the rest of the year with Health, down from these elevated levels maybe Defense and Civil, what those trajectories look like? Chris Cage : Yes, Gavin. We won't put too fine of a point on margins by segment but I think you've got it right. We've been signaling Health is an area that we would expect to moderate down. We still expect that to be the case. But again, we love the team's performance. We talked earlier about burn pit legislation. There are some dynamics there that could help us. But it will not run at these levels because there's been a couple of one-timers in Q1 and Q2 in Health. Civil I think again AEGIS was a program brand new start. We knew it was going to be certainly at the front end of this program, multiyear program on the lower margin range. And that will continue to ramp up. But Civil is also where we absorbed a lot of the legal charges that I talked about. So we see those margins trending better. We -- Roger spoke about some areas of improved activity in our security products business. I don't want to get ahead of ourselves but that's an area that I'd say the back half will be stronger than the first half on profitability and margins. And Civil is a well-run business overall. So I think the Civil performance should trend a little bit higher. And then Defense, quite honestly is probably -- over time, it will be higher. Whether that occurs in the back half of this year's TBD, I mean the special project work that Roger talked about is something that we'd love to see that come on at a higher volume. We're not yet seeing that and therefore don't anticipate that will change in the very near term. There is some transition. The Afghan work moderated down. There's some great airborne opportunities that the team is pursuing. That's something we hope to speak about in the future. That will be a growth catalyst and margin catalyst for us. But right now, I'd say probably along these -- this current trajectory on the defense margin side for the near term. Gavin Parsons : Okay. Thank you. Chris Cage : Thanks, Gavin. Operator : The next question is from the line of Colin Canfield with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Colin Canfield : Hey, good morning. Tying together perhaps Peter and Rob's question. Can you just discuss some of the bigger drivers of next year's growth acceleration? It sounds like the defense hardware pieces of Dynetics seem to be adding outsized lift. And obviously, I understand it takes time to get all the head count added and commercial aero are going to returns in 2024. I guess it's still a TBD given the kind of exposure that you guys have to widebody traffic. So maybe if you could tie together kind of what are your biggest uplifters into next year? Chris Cage : Yeah. I mean, Colin, we're early to get in detail about 2023, right? And we'll certainly speak about that more as we get to next year's guidance. But again, I think Roger talked about the budget backdrop is a foundational starting point and that's favorable. Therefore, the volume of things that we're seeing and bidding on continues to be strong and favorable. And so, defense activity is one that we've seen a lot of throughput in opportunities more Dig MOD opportunities more C4ISR opportunities. I mentioned hopefully some airborne opportunities where we've demonstrated a great capability that the customer is interested in seeing more of. Dynetics in the defense hardware side, absolutely ,there are some programs that will be ramping up. There's also some programs that will be moderating, as we transition towards proof of concept, completing demos and getting into hopefully a production cycle award which will probably be more likely 2024. And so those things all should do fine. Civil again, would probably be the aviation hardware accelerating growth, but not back to pre-COVID levels, but the trends are positive there. And more civil agency digital modernization opportunities we continue to see and bid on that we're pursuing. And the wildcard is Health. Now the one big catalyst that we've been waiting on is the Reserve Health Readiness program. We spoke about that for over a year now. That had been delayed. It was originally in this year's expectation. It's now fully out of any contribution for 2022. But we see that as a big program that we've already won and should ramp up nicely in 2023. So those are a few things that come to mind. But again, we'll talk in more detail about 2023 as we get to that time of the year. Colin Canfield : Got it. And then a longer-term strategic question. But can you just talk about how you're preparing the business for a structurally impaired head count environment? Both you and Booz are kind of talking about IT cyclical benefits and a softer economy freeing up head count. But if you look at the population statistics, labor force participation isn't coming back and the US population growth is almost close to shrinking. So if you think about how you guys are structuring the business around kind of that environment? Roger Krone : Hey, Colin, I'll touch on it a little bit. I'm not sure we have enough time on the call to talk about all the things we're doing. But I think we all realize that we are in an era where there are going to be more jobs than people. I mean, it's just a fundamental structural problem. If you look at college grads and where we can source. And so that from a long-term standpoint talking with our HR and our leadership team, it's about okay, what can we automate, how can we put RPAs into our administrative and functional organizations and free the talent up, so that they can provide value-added goods and services to our customers? And then what is our new knowledge worker work look like in this industry? And then how do we hire them retain them upskill them right and grow them over time? And so we have a long long-term view of our labor strategy and how we want to take people and create multiple gates and multiple steps in their career. So, they graduate from college, they come here they pick up some stretch Thunkable credentials. They add another computer language. They pick up Python. They get a master's degree. We continue to invest in them. They continue to grow and move professionally. And they go wow I'm doing great work. I'm making competitive salary. And I see my career advancing at the company opportunities for growth and management. We're growing. And that's a terrific place to be where we're growing and hiring people. But we do realize that the world that I grew up in is no longer here. And we have to be very thoughtful about where we want to put our people and frankly maybe what we want to do with partners and what we want to do with automation. Chris Cage : And the only thing I'd add to that is again we've been talking about some of these businesses. But clearly we see as growth catalysts some of our businesses that are less head count-dependent. What's happening in Dynetics what's happening with the security products business. So, again, they're not a huge part of the portfolio but they'll becoming increasingly larger part of the portfolio over time. Colin Canfield : Got it. Thanks for the color. Roger Krone : Thank you. Good questions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Thank you. So, you and Booz had some trends that were very similar; strong sales a very anemic bookings although very strong fundings which I don't understand how you get those two together; and very weak cash which slips into the next quarter. Maybe give us some color on how we could get the see the incongruity of bookings and funding. And then looking forward, we've got all that funding is there are we going to have the super blowout September quarter in bookings that we could, or is that still going to be slowed by the issues you discussed Roger? Roger Krone : Yes. So, Cai I think the next quarter will be better, but I don't see the super blowout. I think and clearly Booz and all the other competitors we all work in the same industry. We're all facing the same acquisition issues. A point I would make which is something I can speak to from Leidos, I don't know about the other companies is our win rates are about the same, right? We didn't lose a lot of programs in first quarter or second quarter. There wasn't a lot of opportunities that were canceled, right? Things just moved to the right. And we saw that across our entire value stream. Again, as you pointed out some of our cash payments that we thought were going to happen in the quarter got paid in the first week or two of July. Chris talked about that being I think over $100 million. And it's just the process in the customer is slow. And we -- and I'll go back -- and then we got a couple of protests which really hurt our book-to-bill. But we kind of plan those. Every once in a while we get surprise. We don't get a protest, but more likely than not we get a protest. And that -- the social security bid probably won't turn around provided we prevail in the protest not until third quarter but in fourth quarter. So, that's not really going to give us much lift in third quarter. Again it should be stronger. But I think it is a slower ramp from the budget problems that we had earlier this year and the end of last year. Chris Cage : And I think Cai is increasingly we're talking about the mega awards the larger awards those just don't often line up with the government fiscal year-end third quarter cycle. So, you could see the bigger quarters any time like we had a great first quarter. On the funding side, I mean again I think that's conversion of previous prior awards unfunded to funded. That's not always going to follow the same cycle. It's easy for a contract officer to make that action on something they've already awarded and give you incremental funding dollars versus a whole new procurement decision process. So, to me, it's great. We like to see our funded backlog improving. But I don't think you can read too much into the cycle around when those activities take place versus brand-new award decisions. Roger Krone : Yes Cai. I think a good example is this program we call FENS, which is sort of a network infrastructure program for the FAA. A year ago, we thought it would have happened in first quarter and first quarter it got delayed to the second half of the year. Now it's a little bit uncertain, even when they're going to make the award, I think we can almost count on a protest. So if they make the award in the third quarter or fourth quarter, that could be extended well into 2023. And we just have that kind of uncertainty. And we've seen more of that trend, and more of that behavior perhaps than we have over the past couple of years. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you. And can you give us just some quick color, on what are you seeing in terms of July? Is there being any pickup, or is it still at the same level? What are you seeing there? Roger Krone : Well, cash was good in July. From a war... Chris Cage : We have a couple of strategic wins. We'll be able to talk about that happening. Roger Krone : Yes, we did. They're not quite -- well they're not announceable, yet. Well, I always think every month, we have great wins. So I mean that's just sort of me. There's -- sometimes the wins, I'm most excited about probably don't make the print, because they're strategic and there is technology involved. And we had some of those in July that we'll be able to talk about in the next quarter. And -- but there was no mega win in July. Probably, our next biggest win on the horizon, there's a couple of programs there's a big IDIQ that might get award. But then we have to fight for tens score, it's probably that FAA FENS program. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you very much. Roger Krone : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question Matt Akers : Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for questions. Roger Krone : Good morning, Matt. Matt Akers : I wonder, if you could -- could you comment on your international business? So you did the acquisition in Australia. Obviously, a lot of our allies are talking about spending more on defense. Just curious, if that could be a bigger part of the business in the future. Roger Krone : Listen, we're really pleased with our international work. And we're a little under 10%, by revenue of dollars that come from outside the US, right? And -- but we're going to be very selective. We tend to follow the US, in five Whys. So we're strong in the UK and Australia has always been a traditionally strong market for us. And by the way, they are a terrific ally of the United States. They have fought, I think in every war alongside the US, since the turn of the century. So growing more in Australia, is definitely a priority for us. But we want to grow in the right way and think of us as kind of growing country by country. We want to be in a country, grow large enough where we're going to have infrastructure in critical mass, and then use that country to maybe move regionally. We are not going to be like some of our competitors, where we're big enough that we can have offices in every country. But we think -- the international, is a nice mix in the portfolio. It could be countercyclical, with some of the priorities within the US. And then I put into a whole different category, our SES business, our security business, which by its nature is global, I mean, it's just -- the way that business works both at airports and ports and borders. The machines are easily transportable. By the way the specs and the requirements, are relatively uniform. If you can put a provision at Dulles, you can put a provision in Hong Kong usually with small mods. And that equipment for us is, manufactured in the US and then we export it around the world. And around the world, looks to US, as the standard setter. So in the SES business, we're probably anomaly 125 countries. But it doesn't mean, that we have necessarily a large organization in those countries. We might have a field service tech and an airport. We might have a couple of people doing maintenance and support. And that business, I would tell you today, is already global and isn't going to become more global. We're about in every country, that we feel is appropriate for us to sell in  I really understood your question to be more of okay, well you bought another business in Australia, which we think is a real positive. We're really excited about the business. It's a critical mission for the Australian government. And growing larger in Australia, is absolutely part of our strategy. Matt Akers : That's, great. And then, I guess, just one more on kind of DES and the long-term targets that you guys gave at the Investor Day, last fall. How much was DES included in that, not only from kind of, I guess, a growth standpoint, but also margins? And is -- any potential dilution from that contract we should think about as that program ramps up over the coming years? Chris Cage : Well, Matt, I would tell you that certainly in the near term that won't -- we don't expect the margins on that program to get at or above the corporate average. So we recognize there's some initial investment. In fact that's part of what we're seeing this year quite honestly is while we are in the protest process, the team was building out the PMO staff. They were getting ahead of transition working jump-start. So we're spending money on DES, and we'll continue to do so, because we're taking a big picture a long-term view on that. I would just tell you that I expect 2024 to be more of a significant contribution than 2023. So we've got this ramp-up that Roger spoke about. It's early so we can't give you a lot of precision on exactly the timing and customer adoption. But certainly by 2024, it should be a more significant part of the growth story for us. Matt Akers : Great. Thank you. Chris Cage : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Bert Subin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Bert Subin : Hey, good morning and thank you for the time. Roger Krone : Hey, good morning. Chris Cage : Good morning, Bert. Roger Krone : Roger you noted that SD&A will not recover until 2024. You had previously guided that business, I guess, if we go back to early 2020 to low teens, annual sales growth with expanding margins back when you did that deal with L3. How should we think about the path forward for SD&A now? Does it get back on to that track, or are you really just sort of thinking about it in terms of pro forma 2019 sales? Roger Krone : No. The way we look at it is, we had a path when we bought the business and we signed the deal before COVID. And then we -- there's this huge trough in our revenue and it has affected margin too, although, it's still a nice margin business, right? And we hit bottom. And now we've seen it start to recover and we are seeing double-digit growth in that business year-over-year. In our forecast it will continue where in 2024, we'll hit the pre-COVID level and then it will continue to grow beyond that as airports both in the US and in the rest of the world end up modernizing their equipment, one, because of age, but secondly, because of evolving threat, which is new chemicals, fentanyl, other chemicals, meth that the old machines couldn't detect. What we call touchless is the big demand at airports as we all know is to be able to just walk through. And the technology is emerging where most airports 10 years from now will have a touchless experience for the passenger and we expect that to drive significant demand. I know I would go down a lane that was touchless versus one that was not. Chris Cage : Well, I think look at improved throughput right which is a huge deal. Roger Krone : And efficiencies. So -- and we have been during this sort of troughed area investing heavily in technology so that we are ready to compete as the business comes back. Bert Subin : Just a clarification question on that. Where does border security fit in? I know you have some products there and that seems like there's going to be a lot of future demand. Does this acquisition in Australia have any relation to what you might be doing in that business, or are they completely separate? Roger Krone : Yes. They're completely separate. So this is more -- the Australia business are airplanes with sensors flying over pretty much blue water and littoral water looking for boats that are in distress and maybe boats that shouldn't be there. And our other business is literally where you drive a car through, you drive a truck through. We have a rail business. We're at the Mexican border where the railcars go through one of our machine and then we do personnel screening. So they're very, very different. It is -- I think you are right. The customer when you go way to the top is the same in Australia, but it's probably a different organization of that customer. And we were not interested in the carbon business, because of a crossover to our SES business. Bert Subin : Got it. And then just a quick follow-up if I may. The appropriations process is likely to yield. I think you mentioned earlier Roger defense budget is higher than the initial request. But that's likely to put pressure on non-defense just in terms of thinking about total spending. Is that a good outcome in your view? I know you have pretty similar exposure to both. Roger Krone : Yes. First of all, let me tell you what I think is going to happen and then if you want an editorial of what do I think -- I use -- that too. I think that non-defense will move with defense. I don't think you get an omnibus without moving the non-defense budget in the same direction. I think that's what we've seen in the past couple of years. I think that's what will happen this year. And whether we do this in the lame duck which is what I think is going to happen and people are going to want to move non-defense and defense sort of in lockstep we will get an omnibus. It will get done before the next Congress comes in and we will move on. And I think that will be good for Leidos across the board both our Defense business, our Intel business our Health and Civil. Now if you ask me if that's good, by the way, I think it's good for the company. I think it's good for our employees and our shareholders. I have three-year-old kids and there are times where I wonder when we're going to have to pay this back. And that means maybe there's a tax increase sometime in the distant future or another source of revenue for the federal government. But from a Leidos standpoint, from an investor standpoint I expect the budget environment to be very, very healthy for us for years. Bert Subin : Thanks, Roger. Thanks, Chris. Roger Krone : Okay, Bert. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Seth Seifman : Hey, thanks very much and.. Roger Krone : Hi, Tobey. Seth Seifman : Hi. Its Seth. Just a quick one from me this morning keep it short. But the release mentions the reduction in materials intake at Dynetics as a driver for defense. Does that have to do with sort of scheduled changes in activity there, or is that more of a supply chain issue kind of as we've seen across the industry including at some companies in similar areas like Raytheon and Aerojet? Chris Cage : Yes. So Seth it \u2013 obviously, supply chain is a factor that we're seeing here and there. But the particular issue in hypersonics was kind of plan, the cycle production schedule for that program. It's following course that we expected it to. Now we're hopeful for some more authorizations from a funding perspective that could help the program. As a growth catalyst in 2023 that's something we're paying attention to. But right now there's not a big issue from a supply chain bottleneck although I would say that we're still not out of the woods on that as it relates to certain component parts in various parts of the business. But it hasn't been a major factor for us this quarter. Seth Seifman : Right. Okay. Chris Cage : Thank you. Seth Seifman : I will stick to one today. Thanks. Chris Cage : Great. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The final question is coming from the line of Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Jasper Bibb : Hi. Good morning. This is actually Jasper Bibb on for Tobey. Thanks for taking our questions. So I just wanted to ask about margins in the Civil segment. I think you highlighted SG&A and the contract ramps there. But can you provide a bit more color on when you expect that segment to return to more normalized 2018-2019 profitability level? Chris Cage : Yes. That's certainly something we have ongoing discussion with the leadership team. And there's a lot of catalysts within the Civil business. Certainly, SES is a big part of the longer-term margin strategy. I've mentioned some of the nice program wins that we've had on the defense -- on the digital modernization side and those will be on the lower margin side in the near-term. Where we do really well on margins -- our commercial energy business has been a strong margin catalyst for Civil. We're continuing to see that grow although it's a smaller part of the portfolio. We do well in our transportation, aviation business with the FAA quite honestly. And that's subject to FAA budget environment new program starts. And the anchor is some of our MNO support contracts, mission ops whether that's with DOE or other customers are tend to be on the lower margin side. So I would say in the near-term to get back to those levels is probably a multiyear undertaking as we look to win and execute more Dig Mod portfolio and see SES rebound, but some small improvements in other parts of the portfolio or what we after with the team. So that's how we see it right now Jasper in the near-term. Jasper Bibb : Okay. I appreciate the detail. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Chris Cage : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We reach the end of our question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the floor back to Stuart Davis for closing remarks. Stuart Davis : Thank you, Rob and thank you for your assistance on today's call. And thank you all for joining us this morning and your interest in Leidos. We look forward to updating you again soon. Have a great day. Operator : This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Log off your webcast and have a wonderful day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Stuart Davis, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin. Stuart Davis : Thank you, Maria. And good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our third quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call.  Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO, and Chris Cage, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you'll also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll use during today's call. Turning to slide 2 of the presentation. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, as shown on slide 3, during the call we'll discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in today's press release and presentation slides. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone, who will begin on slide four. Roger Krone : Thank you, Stuart. And thank you all for joining us this morning. Our third quarter results demonstrate the momentum in our business as we continue to report revenue growth at the upper end of our guidance across our diversified portfolio. In addition, our dedicated team delivered earnings in excess of our forecast and generated the highest quarterly cash flow from operations in our history. These results position us well to deliver on our full year financial targets as we make the world safer, healthier and more efficient. As usual, I'll touch on our financial performance, capital allocation, business development performance, and people. First, our financial performance for the quarter was strong and ahead of consensus at both the top and bottom lines. Record revenue of $3.61 billion were up 4% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.3% was up 10 basis points sequentially and non-GAAP diluted EPS came in above our forecast and consensus.  Our third quarter performance and improved visibility enables us to raise our revenue outlook and derisk our earnings for the full year. We also generated a record $748 million of cash flow from operations. This puts us on track to meet our cash commitment for the year, strengthens our balance sheet and positions us for future capital deployments to benefit shareholders.  Which brings me to point number two, our approach to capital allocation. Yesterday, we closed our acquisition of Cobham Aviation Services, Australia's aviation Special Mission unit. This business provides border force airborne surveillance, and marine safety search and rescue, and generates roughly $100 million in annual revenues. It is immediately accretive to both non-GAAP EPS and EBITDA margin. At this point in our strategic journey, the Cobham acquisition is a great example of what we're looking for. It expands market access, provides us franchise programs with a customer of strategic importance and complements our existing business, all at a multiple below ours and a price that enables our shareholders to benefit from future revenue and cost synergies.  Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $807 million as collections were especially strong in the back half of September to close out the government fiscal year. Our plan is not to accumulate cash. We just paid for the Cobham acquisition, and we'll be paying down some debt to move closer to our target leverage ratio of 3 times. Our balance sheet enables us to steadily deploy capital in productive ways.  Given the strength of the company and a valuation that doesn't reflect our long history of driving steady earnings growth and cash generation, we'll lean towards share repurchase when we have deployable capital.  Number three, our business development results demonstrate that our strong positioning in the government technology marketplace is enabling us to navigate a difficult environment. The current timelines continue to extend and DoD outlays continue to lag budget authority. With net bookings of $4.1 billion in the quarter, we achieved a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 and grew backlog to $35 billion or $35.4 billion on a constant currency bases. We also had nearly $1 billion of third quarter awards protested. Absent the protests, book-to-bill would have been 1.4.  Highlighting some important awards. We received a five-year $1.5 billion task order to support the DoD with rapid technology insertion to enhance C5ISR missions globally. We expect to receive the full award value over the life of the contract. But in accordance with our policy, we only booked $100 million in the quarter. This award, known as Sentinel, is all about getting capabilities into theater and to the combatant commanders quickly. As a solution agnostic integrator, part of our role is to find innovative technologies that can be rapidly matured, proven and integrated in support of multi-domain operations. Sentinel fits within the Joint All-Domain Command and Control or JADC2 umbrella. Our positioning on JADC2 was also bolstered by the Air Force's selection of the Advanced Battle Management System Digital Infrastructure Consortium. With four other consortium members, Leidos will work to deliver the Air Force's vision for distributed battle management and decision advantage by enabling speed, security and integration at scale.  NAVSEA awarded Leidos a $358 million contract to design and build a medium-sized unmanned undersea vehicle to provide autonomous oceanographic sensing and data collection for operational intelligence as well as to support mine countermeasures.  We also received our first task order on the $11.5 billion Defense Enclave Services contract. The $138 million task order will lay the framework and begin to consolidate, integrate and optimize five agencies on a common network architecture through digital modernization and transformation. We successfully completed the transition period and have assumed operational responsibility for DODNet and DISANet.  And in a key win for our space business within Dynetics, we received a subcontract with Northrop Grumman to develop hypersonic defense sensors for the Space Development Agency. We have more than 40 years of experience developing and flying space-based electrooptical and infrared sensors and payloads for a variety of missions. Through this award, we'll develop and build the sensor payload for a proliferated constellation of low Earth orbit satellites for the Tranche 1 Tracking Layer. The Tracking Layer constellation will detect and track advanced hypersonic and ballistic missile threats as part of SDA's missile defense architecture. On the predecessor contract, our Tranche 0 payload is on scheduled to launch by the end of the year. The Tranche 1 design will increase coverage area, while reducing payload size, weight and power. Eventually, these constellations of satellites will form the core of a new National Defense Space Architecture, providing global coverage and adding resiliency in the country's missile warning arena.  As a reminder, we'll be hosting an investor site visit at Dynetics in Huntsville, Alabama on December 1. Please reach out to Stuart if you're interested in attending. And the final key win that I'll touch on this morning is the re-award of our IT support to the Social Security Administration. As of the second quarter call, our award was protested by the previous incumbent. And after a resubmission of proposals, the SSA re-awarded all of the work to Leidos. The incumbent once again protested the award and the new GAO review period expires on January 3.  And lastly, point number four. Leidos is an attractive destination for great talent. In the third quarter, we hired just over 2,800 people. And year to date, we've hired more than 9,000 people and increased headcount by more than 2,000. It's still early, but voluntary attrition is trending in the right direction, and we don't expect that staffing will significantly constrain our plans for next year. Our dedicated and capable people are a key differentiator for us and an important national asset. Before turning it over to Chris, let me touch on the federal budget landscape. As expected, the federal government is operating under a continuing resolution at last year's funding levels until December 16. Congress is still working on the appropriations and authorization bills for government fiscal year 2023. Nothing will get voted on until after the November 8 elections, but we expect that robust budgets will get passed before the end of the calendar year. Outlays are beginning to improve which bodes well for future growth. Chris, over to you. Chris Cage : Thanks, Roger. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. Third quarter results were positive and in line with the picture that we gave on the second quarter call.  Turning to slide 5. Revenues for the quarter were $3.61 billion, up 4% compared to the prior-year quarter despite a currency translation headwind of $32 million.  Adjusted EBITDA was $372 million for the third quarter for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.3%, which was up 10 basis points sequentially.  Non-GAAP net income was $221 million or $1.59 per share. Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS were down 15% and 12% respectively compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, which had the highest earnings in our history, driven primarily by the COVID catchup in the business.  Let me touch on a few of the below-the-line drivers. Net interest expense increased to $50 million from $47 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 with the rise in interest rates. The weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 138 million compared to 143 million in the prior-year quarter, driven by the ASR we executed in the first half of the year.  Finally, the non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.8%, up 170 basis points sequentially, which reflected the cumulative catchup for changes to the mix of revenues across foreign and state jurisdictions. The higher-than-expected tax rates lowered non-GAAP diluted EPS in the quarter by $0.04.  Now for an overview of our segment results and key drivers on slide 6. Defense Solutions revenues increased by 3.3% compared to the prior-year quarter. The largest growth drivers were the ramps on the NGEN and various force protection programs, which more than offset the end of our Afghanistan support contracts and the foreign exchange headwind. Defense Solutions non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter came in at 8.1%.  Civil revenues increased 10.4% compared to the prior-year quarter. The NASA AEGIS program was the primary revenue driver, but we also saw good growth on our security products and commercial energy businesses. The mix shift helped drive non-GAAP operating income margin to 11%, up from 9.6% in the prior-year quarter and the highest level in six quarters.  Health revenues decreased 3.4% over the prior-year quarter. Revenue in the year-ago period benefited from the backlog of disability exams caused by COVID-19. And our share of certain exams has fallen with additional competitors added to one of our contracts. These factors outweighed another strong quarter on the DHMSM program. To this point, we have not seen much benefit from the PACT Act that was passed in the last quarter, although disability exam volumes remain high. Non-GAAP operating income margin came in at 15%, which is where we've been signaling all year.  Turning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on slide 7. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $748 million and free cash flow was $721million. These were record numbers for Leidos, and I'm tremendously proud of the team's focus and dedication. In addition, the government customers were looking to clear the decks at the end of their fiscal year and, in some cases, paid invoices that would normally have been collected in Q4.  DSOs in the quarter came down 3 days sequentially to 58, which is our target level. Great effort by the entire team.  During the third quarter, we returned $53 million to shareholders primarily through our ongoing dividend program. At the end of the quarter, we had $807 million in cash and cash equivalents and $5 billion of debt. We closed the Cobham Aviation Special Mission acquisition earlier this week for $214 million inclusive of the hedge that we had taken at the signing of the definitive agreement. In addition, we continue to focus on reducing our leverage ratio and we'll use some of our cash balances to repay part of the billion dollars of debt that matures in the first half of 2023 and reposition our balance sheet for the future. On to 2022 guidance. Our new ranges are shown on slide 8 and you can see the outlook has improved from last quarter based on strong performance across the company. The revised guidance includes two months of contribution from the Special Mission business acquisition as well. We now expect 2022 revenues between $14.2 billion and $14.4 billion. So we've added $300 million to the bottom of the prior range and $100 million to the top end, even after absorbing an adverse impact of foreign exchange rates of about $70 million.  We're reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance of 10.3% to 10.5%. We still have work to do to get back in the margin range for the year, but I'm proud of how the entire company has responded to the margin pressures that we spoke of on last call. For example, we decreased indirect spending and improved direct labor utilization across all three segments. We're also taking a look at accelerating real estate reductions to drive out additional cost, which will improve our competitiveness and our margins going forward. We'll have more to report on that front on the Q4 call.  We're now guiding non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $6.20 and $6.40. So we've taken $0.10 off the top and bottom of the prior ranges. As I touched on earlier, our effective tax rate for the year is going to be a full point higher than we previously expected, which creates an $0.08 headwind to EPS. Compared to last quarter, our confidence around operating performance has improved.  Finally, we're keeping cash flow from operations guidance at $1 billion or greater. Obviously, we had a tremendous performance in Q3, which puts us on track for another strong cash year.  We continue to monitor the potential for Congress to act on the tax research cost capitalization rules. With no change in law, the cost capitalization provision amounts to a negative impact to operating cash flow of about $150 million annually. We haven't made any federal tax payments related to the amortization of resource costs this year, and do not plan to, although we will continue to reevaluate as conditions change. Barring a legislative fix, we expect to pay this $150 million in early January of 2023 and then make normal quarterly tax payments inclusive of this impact thereafter.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob, so we can take some questions. Oh, I'm sorry, Maria. Maria, we're ready to take some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Gavin Parsons with Goldman Sachs. Gavin Parsons : Roger, you mentioned you don't expect staffing to significantly constrain your 2023 plan. Could you give us an early look at what that plan is in terms of revenue, margins and maybe cash flow? Roger Krone : We don't guide to 2023 until the end of the year. And so, we're not going to put out any numbers. What we will tell you, though, is that if you go back to our Investor Day and we put some longer term goals on Investor Day, and we're still confident with the numbers we provided you. I think it was October a year ago. But we're still very excited about what's going on in our space and we had a great quarter and we expect 2023 to be strong. Gavin Parsons : Maybe in terms of defense, you guys have talked a lot about investments you're making there. I wonder if you could tell us a little bit more about that and the expected payback period, that will be great. Roger Krone : Well, maybe I'll start and then Chris can come back in. We, especially in our mission and operations area, find customers who want to accelerate capability and look to the contractor base to make investments to get them capability into theater faster. And the army has some airborne programs. In fact, I think our RFP just came out a week ago and we made some investments ahead of that program. And we hope to get a decision, which will be next year, and actually start the program next year. When we make an investment like that, it's usually on a pretty short string. And it's very consistent with the airborne work that we already do, and those margins tend to be above our corporate average. Chris Cage : Yeah, that's right. And, Gavin, just add to that, Roger talked about the great win our space team had on the Tranche 1 Tracking Layer. And that's an example of where we've made some investments to ensure we could acquire the appropriate long lead items. Everybody's talking about supply chain constraints. We've been monitoring that to make sure we got out ahead of the materials were needed to successfully win that contract as one example and then to continue to invest in our capability in clean rooms, engineering talent, etc. So those are a few example. The Dynetics, if you're able to make it down to the trip that Roger talked about, that'll give you a firsthand view of some of the areas where we've clearly made some investments in our facilities, team and capabilities. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Robert Spingarn : Roger, when we talk to investors new to Leidos, we often highlight your diverse segments and end markets. And so in that vein, I wanted to ask a longer term question as you head into next year and beyond, where you see the sales momentum among the segments based on market interest in your products and services. So, essentially, what I mean is that, obviously, we're hopefully exiting the pandemic and rethinking how we handle a major medical crisis. And you're in the health business. We're in the midst of a major infrastructure build here in the US and here in the Civil business. And of course, we have a rising defense budget and a war in Europe. So how do you think long term about relative growth for each of the segments? Roger Krone : Of course, what we have been saying for years is we have been portfolio shaping and positioning the company both in Health, Civil and Defense, to be in the swim lanes that are moving faster. And so, just as I reflect on all three of those, of course, our Health business continues to have really, really strong momentum. We're almost through the COVID catchup and back to normal growth levels. But we see continued growth in our Health business really driven by CMS, Social Security, and what's going on in DHA, and it's just been a great performer for us. In Civil, we've talked now for quarters about the resurgence in air travel. And we're seeing strong resurgence certainly in the US, as I think all of us can attest. And we're finally starting to see the revenue passenger kilometers pick up internationally. And our SCS team has had probably more meetings with customers in the last quarter than they did all of last year. So we're traveling again. And that bodes well for increased orders, which will lead to increased sales in our global security business.  And then Defense, which we actually \u2013 if you think about a year ago \u2013 thought was probably going to be our lower growth business. But as we've all come to learn, the world is a very complicated place and it continues to be very, very complicated. And I think those issues require that both the US and our allies continue to invest, maybe more than they would otherwise like to in the defense of the nation. And so, our Defense business has really held up held up well. And we don't see anything on the horizon that changes our view of that future. And I think it really speaks to some of the decisions we made to shape the portfolio and emphasize on the parts of the business that we did.  And I'll highlight one other thing. It's a smaller business for us and we don't often talk about it. But within the Civil group, we have a commercial energy business. That has just been going great. We do a lot of engineering for investor owned utilities and energy savings programs for large production facilities. And that business has been growing in double-digits. And it's interesting that utilities are connected to 5G because you put 5G on towers and you need engineering for that. And that business has turned out to be a huge growth engine for us as well. I don't know, Chris, you want to\u2026 Chris Cage : Rob, I think Roger covered the landscape pretty well. I would say that, in the near term, again, our Health business, very proud of that business and the team and we spoke about the SSA. This is a hard fought battle to make sure that we ultimately prevail through the protests. Feel confident. That'll be a growth catalyst for us in 2023. We're quite sure.  The RHRP program that we've been talking about for years, finally, we're up and running on that. So really feel like the Health business has room to grow in the near term. And then, the Dynetics business is really 2024 and beyond when you've got these force protection programs, you've got space, you've got things that can really ramp up into significant program quantities. We're very excited about that. Robert Spingarn : So, Chris, on that last part, you talked about up to 2024. But when I think about five years from now, for example, if Dynetics is growing faster than the rest of the company, do you see the overall portfolio, the three segments, the same relative sizes in that long-term timeframe, five years out? Chris Cage : No, I would say that\u2026 Robert Spingarn : Defense is the biggest piece by double. Chris Cage : Yeah, if you start to get into the back half of the 20s, if things play out the way we hope to, I think Dynetics has more opportunities with the defense hardware side to really grow those into substantial programs. But don't forget, we've got the DES program too ramping up on the digital modernization side. So that should be a big catalyst for us in defense as well. So probably, back half of the year, I can see that Defense segment accelerating growth beyond what we're seeing in Health and Civil, but I wouldn't count them out. Roger Krone : Rob, a point I would make as you think about the coming five years from now, the Health is primarily a kind of a people services driven business and I think it will continue to grow well and we'll provide health managed services to active military and veterans and others. But five years from now, some of the programs that we've been talking about, [indiscernible] or SS, they'll be an in significant production. And that will help to look change the complexion of the company a little bit, so that we have 15% or 20% of month-over-month production programs generating higher margin than our average. And what we're going through now in 2022 and 2023 is the development of the programs in enduring fires, the high energy laser, the Common-Hypersonic Gide Body, which is just ramping up, and the stuff we're doing on Tranche 1. By the way, there is a Tranche 2 and a Tranche 3. So if you think about what we will look like five years from now, we will have the base business that we've always had and we will add to it, kind of above that base some significant production program. So we're really excited about the company five years from now. Operator : Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Spencer Breitzke : This is Spencer Breitzke on for Cai. Can you talk about if you've seen a pickup in award activities since the Pentagon occupancy limit was lifted in September? Chris Cage : I don't know, Spencer, that we've seen a noticeable difference before or after, quite honestly. That wasn't really a constraint that we'd seen. I think the Pentagon activity generally has been as expected, the bookings. As Roger mentioned, we did see a number of RFPs dropped in our Defense business here over the course of October. So that's been very active in our proposal pits very recently. So that's exciting to see. But the Pentagon volume, I wouldn't say we noticed a big impact pre or post. Roger Krone : A comment I would make is Bill LaPlante finally was confirmed by the Senate and put in as the acquisition exec in the Pentagon. And I would say since he's taken office, we've seen sort of upbeat in activity. Bill's been very accessible to industry. There have been a couple of tri service meetings with Bill. And he's trying to, I think, accelerate the RFPs and to get outlays where they need to be. And I think that's a real positive sign.  I would look more towards that than I would the occupancy limit on the Pentagon. But I will confirm whether it's delivered on the Pentagon or not, I think we've probably been in the Pentagon more in the last quarter than we were in the first half of the year. So I think it all bodes well that will \u2013 increase the activity and we'll get some of these procurements under contract. Operator : Our next question is from Matthew Akers with Wells Fargo. Eric Yan : This is Eric Yan on for Matt. Just on CR, could you talk a little bit about the environment we're in today compared to last year? Just what kind of impact have you seen from the CR so far? Also, if you think it'll get extended again into next year? Roger Krone : Yeah. Especially if we compare it to last year \u2013 this time last year, I guess I was optimistic that we'd get a bill before the end of the year. And as we recount what happened last year, almost took the whole first quarter to finally get a bill. And that did have an impact. It just caused everything to slow because you're captive to prior-year level. I'm more optimistic this year. I can't predict the future. None of us can, but when we talk to members of Congress, the senior senator from the State of Alabama, they all seem committed to get it done in the lame duck period after the election. And so, I have more calm pretense that we'll get an omnibus before the end of the year, but no one can predict, lots of issues. I think we're all reading the newspaper about the election and how things will go. But I feel better today than I did a year ago that we're going to get an omnibus and we'll avoid the extended CR that we had last year. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. Peter Arment : Chris, maybe you could just update us on how you're dealing with labor inflation just regarding any salary adjustments and how that kind of flows through and impacts the top line, how should we be thinking about that? Chris Cage : Well, definitely. And certainly, something we've spent a lot of time on throughout the year and even most recently as a leadership team. So I think what we've been doing is, obviously, our merit budget pool has been increasing and we've seen that consistently over the course of the past two to three years and expect it'll tick up again as we're looking ahead to 2023. So in the past, that was a sub 3% kind of annual pool and then we'd have some one-off increases over the course of the year. I think what we're seeing now is above \u2013 mid 3s to 4 or higher in certain cases. And so, that will roll through the top line as a tailwind on the cost reimbursable programs, which I'm sure you're aware are in the order of 50% of the portfolio. So that's goodness there on the top line contributor for growth. The balancing act is managing that on the fixed price and T&M programs. And we've been successful there. I would say that managing margins this quarter at 10.3%, could have been better. But we're looking ahead to a strong Q4. So we're very thoughtful on building our pricing up and passing those inflationary cost pressures along to our customers where we can. Certainly, it'll be priced in as we put together next year's forward pricing rates. But it's absolutely something we're spending a lot of time on as a management team and being thoughtful, especially for the areas of talent that are in the highest demand. Peter Arment : And just as a follow-up, Roger, can you maybe just update us on the aviation screening business. I know that you kind of put it out there that this was still going to be a [Technical Difficulty] in 2024. But just any kind of greenshoots you might be seeing there. Thanks. Roger Krone : I see if I can do this quickly. And we've always described the US business as sort of an RFP, get certified, compete for the business. And it's funded really through authorizations and appropriations. That business continues to go well. There's opportunities to insert new technology, what we call CT or computer tomography at the checkpoint for carry on. And we're in the process of getting our equipment certified. And we continue to see success domestically or in the US, along with our competitors. So that business is great.  What will really drive growth in that business is the return of the international business, and the international business tends to be funded by ticket surcharges. So it's more related to travel volume than it is in the US where it's essentially funded by the federal government. And it's a lag. So the tickets, traffic has to come back, the ticket volume has to go up. The airport authorities, every airport has a different governance structure, they have to be confident that the volume is there. And then they start to engage with the contractor base, they put out RFPs, we go and talk, we do demos, right. And then it takes literally months or a year or two before there's acquisition, you get certified, you get an award, you build the equipment, you deliver it. So, unfortunately, there's a long timeline to this recovery.  But the good news is, at the front end, the RFP activity, the demos, the requests that we have for specifications and the like is up significantly year-over-year. And I said our team is literally flying all over the world, talking to airport owners and operators about what's available.  And I'll make another point. We've done this before. During the period, kind of the COVID period, we couldn't use that as an opportunity to up our investment in technology and our product. We wanted to make sure that we had state-of-the-art detection equipment. There are a variety of new substances that airports want to detect, fentanyl being one of them. And that required us to tweak our algorithms. There are some other reasons why we tweaked algorithms in the US. But we took the time, right, when maybe production wasn't where we wanted it to be. But we took our team and used it to invest in technology to make sure that our products were worldwide competitive. And now, we're benefiting from that, is that we are at the leading edge with competition on what we have to offer. And customers realize that and they've asked us to come and talk to them. So we're excited about that. Chris Cage : Especially in the European market, Peter, I'd say that's probably the area we're seeing the most receptiveness, we've had the most visits, there's probably some things that we're more optimistic on there. Hopefully, Asia will follow. But that's probably further behind. Roger Krone : Yeah, I think everyone knows that China is still essentially shut down for COVID and that does dampen travel in the Pacific region. But Chris is right, we've had a lot of trips to Europe. Operator : Our next question is from Colin Canfield with Barclays. Colin Canfield : Certainly back on the defense production and airport recovery comments, can you just maybe talk us through the margin bridge from here to 2024's Investor Day target of over 10.5%? And then maybe discuss which programs that you guys are developing under fixed price and how you think about kind of that cash risk versus getting to production? Chris Cage : Colin, I'll start and Roger can pile on. So, certainly, the margin bridge, and as Roger was asked earlier, we're not going to paint a detailed 2023 picture at this point in time. But the good news is, when you look at how this quarter played out, I think that's indicative of a great jumping off point. Health kind of came back to where we expected to be more on normalized basis. We'll have some up quarters and down quarters, but mid-teens was kind of the baseline and to give us a platform to potentially expand from there. Civil showed what it's capable of with a modest increase in volumes, security products and good management. And I'd say the defense side of the business is where we have some more opportunities to increase margins, right?  So, balancing all that out, I'd say, looking ahead to 2023, coupled with the inflationary discussion earlier, we'll put together a plan that keeps us in the 10s and where that falls out. More work to be done. But I liked the portfolio. But, definitely, when we get to 2024 and we've gotten more production oriented outputs of bounce back in SES, that's when we feel more bullish on the 10.5% plus margin target longer term.  So I think we're in a good place to bridge that. I don't know if it'll be an up year or flat year, but more to come on that when we give you the 2023 guidance. Roger Krone : I'll just add a sense or two, kind of footstall what Chris discussed. So, really two ways we drive margin. Performance on the existing contracts and then changing the mix, so that we have programs that on their face have higher revenue opportunity. We have always focused on performance, and that's your write ups versus write downs and control of indirect costs and overhead. And we're a very lean company. We have less than 100 senior executives in the company. We run a $15 billion, $14 billion company with that, and we continue to focus on that. And we've had success. But in our success, we are not adding to corporate office overhead and indirect costs. And then on mix, and that's been our story now for years, is that we do have in our portfolio some businesses where we operate in Antarctica, we do large M&O. And those tend to be below the corporate average. And over time, those were important programs, important programs for the nation, but we want to complement those with programs that have higher margin potential.  And we talked about production programs earlier. Even in some of our digital transformation programs, if we can get special project work, if we can do enhancements, we can drive those to the higher margin. If we do all of that, the 10.5% is achievable. Colin Canfield : It looks like the DoD put out a strategic plan on Friday. And it seems like the plan suggested that we get to 100% MHS GENESIS roll out by 2024. So, if you can just maybe update us on the revenue cadence around that program and kind of how that multi-year stepdown interacts with your Health margins. Chris Cage : Colin, again, I think the team has done an excellent job. GENESIS has been a growth driver for us this year. And we certainly are pivoting into a point where it's going to taper down a bit, and we're approximately two-thirds deployed through the program at this point in time. So, 2023 will continue on that cadence.  What I will say is, certainly, the customer, and Roger can elaborate on this, there's been a lot of discussion, getting the base deployment, but then enhancing the capability of the software suite that we've got available to the customer. And there's been a lot of discussion and opportunity and growth that we'll see coming on the back of that, that take full advantage of what the capabilities are. So, little early to paint the picture on how much of a step down we'll see as the deployments moderate. But we're very cognizant of that. And the Health team has been working hard to find opportunities to offset that.  Roger, you want to\u2026? Roger Krone : We continued our deployments through Hurricane Ian. Really on schedule to finish the program, frankly, on cost or under cost and on schedule. The DHMSM program is probably below the average in the Health group. So if you kind of understand the portfolio, it's a very solid program. We're excited about the performance. But there are just the way that portfolio shapes and the nature of the programs that as it tails down and we replace it with other work, frankly, there might even be some opportunities for margin improvement. But the volume is definitely going to come down. And we're trying to get to a position where we're doing the operations and maintenance of the system at all the military treatment facilities. But as we've said, I am sure you've followed the program from the beginning, you do get to the point where you've installed the [indiscernible] GENESIS software and all the military treatment facilities and the program takes a different shape. Operator : Our next question is with Bert Subin with Stifel. Bert Subin : Maybe staying on the Health side of things, the PACT Act should result in an uptick in the VA backlog as just veterans start applying for those benefits and compensation. But, Chris, you seem to note during your prepared remarks that you aren't seeing that yet. How should we think about that bill impacting both 4Q sales and then into 2023? And is that something that could get Health back to year-over-year growth? Chris Cage : Well, definitely. Part of what we're not seeing is that the VA didn't necessarily set up a way to track that explicitly just yet. So the team is working to make sure we understand what's coming through as the PACT Act cases versus otherwise. But I think the main point is, this is ahead of us. Right? And, yes, it could be a contributor to the fourth quarter, that would be something, if it were to happen, could be one of the catalysts to push us up in the margin range as an example. So that's why there's a range there. But certainly, for 2023, we're bullish on how that plays out. And we've seen good overall referral volume. We were navigating throughout the year this recompete and reallocation of some of our other work to multiple competitors. But for the most part, that's settled out, maybe there's a little bit more of that to go. But I certainly look at the PACT Act case volume to be one of the areas that can drive growth for us in 2023. Bert Subin : Just on your comments there on sort of the margin and EPS range. The narrowed guidance that you guys have implies a pretty wide range of potential outcomes for 4Q, I think, from anywhere from $1.44 to $1.64 in earnings, which would be at the midpoint below what you've seen sort of each quarter this year. Just curious what's driving that expectation? And if you guys were to end up closer to that low end, what do you think would have driven that? Chris Cage : Bert, so a couple of things going on there. Obviously, we'll still see interest rates have been trending up, right? That'll be a little bit of a headwind as we look at the fourth quarter on the below-the-line item. Diluted share count, we're at 138 million, rounding down. There's a scenario where it could pop to $139 million and round up. So, that's kind of in play there. And we talked about the tax rate, right? So, taxes were a driver, the tax rate being higher than we expected at the end of the year. The team is working hard, as they always do, to minimize the tax expense. But I'd say it's more of the below-the-line items that are kind of in play there. I think, operationally, we feel solid about the trajectory of the business. Bert Subin : And just a clarification question, Roger, for you, if I could quickly. You noted some positive commentary on SG&A. Are you sticking with sort of the 2024 full recovery timeline? Roger Krone : Yeah. Yeah. We're expecting 2024 to be at or above pre-COVID levels. Operator : Our next question is from Ellen Page with Jefferies. Ellen Page : I understand that you don't want to give 2023 guidance. But are there any major program drivers beyond the SDES [ph] and RHRP to think about? And we always hear about your successes, but are there any losses to be aware of? Chris Cage : Those are the bigger ones. Obviously, the SSA, RHRP, we just talked a little about the PACT Act on the disability case volume and where that can play out. Aegis will have a full year of volume. So that's great. And you mentioned DES as well, right? So those are some of the ones that are kind of in the bag that will be growth catalysts. It's not a recent loss, but the NGA items, UFS contract, for example, we talked about that at the beginning of the year as a loss. We continue to execute on that for half the year through the third quarter. That'll fall out of the portfolio. So that's one of the headwinds that we'll have. But more recently, our recompete win rate has been quite strong. And so, feel good about that. And so, I can't think of another material downer that we'd have to overcome heading into 2023. Roger Krone : Ellen, what's been great about the journey at Leidos is losing a $1 billion program when we were 5 or 10 years ago was really, really material for us. Now, we're bidding probably north of $50 billion worth of stuff in a year. And so, if we were to lose a $1 billion program \u2013 and, clearly, we don't win everything, and so there are programs like that that we have not won. Usually new business and takeaways, not a recompete. It tends not to have a significant impact. All companies do this. Sometimes we stretched a bid on something that's maybe a little bit outside the strike zone, and we lose those, but it helps to build a relationship with the customer. And then maybe when we bid the next program, we win those.  Like all companies, we do lose programs. Not every week, but often. But we win a lot more than we lose, which is what we're trying to do. And as Chris said, we have a lot of work to do between now and the end of the year. It's amazing how many RFPs have dropped and how busy our team is, frankly, across all five of our business groups and three of our reporting segments and writing proposals over the two holidays, which tends to be the way things work in our industry. Ellen Page : Just on NGEN, profitability was a little lower in the first half. How do we think about revenue and profitability on that program into Q4 and beyond? Chris Cage : I think that's one that I would say the best days are ahead of it as far as profitability goes, quite honestly. Revenue has settled into a nice range, team's done a great job, staffing levels are robust. And so, our team, DJ, our program manager, Steve Hall [ph] (51:27), our ops manager, have done an excellent job preparing that program for success. But I still would say, our expectations, our margins will continue to tick up. I don't think you should expect significant movements, but it should be a nice tailwind for us as we look ahead to 2023 and beyond. Operator : Our next question is from Mariana Perez Mora with Bank of America. Mariana Perez Mora : [indiscernible] acquisition clause, what's your appetite to increase international and/or NATO exposure? Chris Cage : International. Mariana, I would say, well, obviously, Roger talked about Cobham extensively, very excited about that one. You know we've got a large presence in Australia just like we do in the UK. So certainly those would be areas that we're quite comfortable adding more capability on to. And then, internationally, NATO has been around customer of ours historically. We've done some excellent work for them, some challenging programs and some very successful programs. But I don't think you'll see a scattershot of other international beachheads. I think we'll be very selective where we have kind of a major muscle movement.  Obviously, our SES business does a lot of work internationally. So, that's one that if there's areas to complement their capabilities from a service delivery perspective, we'll look to do that. But right now, it's probably playing to our strengths. And I would say our strengths are our business in Australia and the UK is the top priorities. Roger Krone : Mariana, we tend to go where the US goes. The Five Eyes countries, the NATO aligned countries, and then we tend to go where the world is complicated. And right now, Europe and the Pacific Rim are places that we see growth. And so, we're excited about that. And Chris mentioned, I think we sell equipment through the SES business maybe to 125 different countries. Not all of that is direct, some of that is through manufacturers reps, but we have people probably in 40, maybe 45 different countries supporting some of the SES products at commercial airports. Mariana Perez Mora : Would you mind reminding us from an M&A point of view, what do you look at in terms of like capabilities, customers, contracts that you would like to add to your portfolio? Chris Cage : We've been talking about M&A for quite some time. And first the footstall. We don't feel compelled to do a big M&A. We like the portfolio. We like the size, the scope and scale of the business. It's really opportunistic, and places where we can either add a new capability that complements an existing line of business, or we get access to a new customer. The Cobham acquisition is really an example of a capability that we're very comfortable with. We actually fly the same type of aircraft, Challenger 650s and Dash 8s. So, really familiar with the hardware, but it allowed us to extend to a new customer in Australia that's really, really important to the country. Australia has literally thousands of miles of coastline. And really important that those are surveyed, and that they provide search and rescue services. And so, we saw that in combination with our existing footprint in Australia, to extend our business and to access a new customer base that we hadn't access before. So it's a perfect example of what we would look for.  But I will just put stop again. We're not in an aggressive posture on M&A. I think we're going to be opportunistic, as we go forward and execute on our book of business and deploy our cash in a way that creates value for our shareholders. Operator : Our next question is from Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities. Tobey Sommer : From a product standpoint and solution standpoint, sort of the higher margin areas of the business, where are you from a mix shift perspective, sort of where the current portfolio is versus maybe what you aspire to over time? And do you have any visibility to that improving or increasing into next year? You mentioned a LEO satellite, which is why I asked? Roger Krone : Toby, we don't put out hard numbers. I would tell you from a solution standpoint, we're pretty comfortable with where we have moved and the valuated work that we do, the special project work we do on some of our contracts. And to provide a solution to a customer, we've really worked hard to position the business in that way. From the actual hardware component \u2013 by the way, we love to make hardware that is part of the bigger solution where those things go, go hand in glove. But we've been working through program wins and through M&A to add a slight bit more hardware component to our offering. By the way, it tends to have very sticky IP. If you've got a manufacturing facility, you tend to hold on to the program. They tend to be longer lived as programs go. You have 5-year production runs, you have 10-year production runs. And although we have some things that are in production, our hope is to add four or five products to our production portfolio. And as we said at the at the beginning, five years from now, to have a more significant part of our portfolio is actually connected to some hardware. Tobey Sommer : To follow-up on a prior question about sort of M&A, I know you've put out some stuff, but from a market perspective, with higher rates and PE maybe not being able to pay the same kind of multiples they otherwise would, lower leverage, higher interest, does that over the next, I don't know, so many quarters provide a better opportunity for strategic buyers, such as yourselves with the financial flexibility to maybe compete even more successfully on a go forward basis for acquisitions than you might have been able to in recent years with low interest rates? Roger Krone : Toby, it's a good theory. And I think there's a strong basis in the points that you make. First I'd point out is, PE is still very strong in our markets. And without going through some of the specific firms, one just did a $10 billion capital raise, and so there seems to be a lot of money available to private equity. So, we don't see them leaving the market. Interest rates drive up the cost of capital for everybody. It does change the business case. But it also would change the business case for us. Do I think strategics kind of come back with a little bit more balance sheet power and then play in the market? It could happen.  What we try to do is not get tied up in the kind of it's a good interest rate, it's a bad interest rate. We really try to look at the fundamental, strategic fit of the business, and then see if we can get it at a price which closes on our business case. And we've used that approach in everything that we bought. And that's really how we do M&A going forward. Interest rates come and go, PE can come and go, and we just need to stay close to our strategy and our knitting and buy those things that makes sense for us. Stuart Davis : Maria, it looks like we're just at the top of the hour. So I think we have time for just one more question. Operator : Our last question is Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets. Ken Herbert : Roger, I just wanted to ask you. You've got, obviously, a number of opportunities on the hardware side. And if I think about your defense portfolio and you've alluded to an anticipated step up in 2024 in this business, what should we focus on? What are the key milestones in 2023 as you look at that portfolio, either in terms of contract milestones, downselects? How should we think about tracking this through 2023 and what could you highlight as sort of the key watch items? Roger Krone : Ken, great kind of a provocative question. By the way, the good news is lots. So, no single program, no single downselect drives the business. We've got to get wide field of view Tranche 0 up into space, we're going to get Tranche 1 up into space, we've got to transition our enduring fires, both the enduring, which is the missile and high energy laser, we need to get those in to test. We have some things on the weapons side, those need to get into test. On the airborne, we need to win the next airborne competitive program with the Army for their enhanced ISR program, which is a Bombardier 6500 class aircraft. And so, we just go around the portfolio and it's a lot of, I won't call it, singles and doubles, but is World Series season. So they really are kind of singles and doubles, there is no big home run out there that we need to execute the strategy. And so, you just kind of look at the press releases and we went into programs, so they have hardware content. Are we successful in getting these things fielded, getting things in orbit? Our MUUV program that I talked about, so we now are in development. So that needs to go. PDR, CDR into production. We need to start building UUVs. And they just continue in that vein. Chris Cage : I feel like we're a shill for the Dynetics business, but the team will certainly talk in more detail at the end of November, December 1 on what some of those milestones look like. And so, Roger has just hit on it. We're excited that we have more than a handful to focus on, but we've got the right team executing against that. And there's some things where hopefully will be some additional contractual orders you'll see out of SES and maybe a low rate production order out of Dynetics. But, again, that site visit will give you an opportunity to dig deeper there. Ken Herbert : If I could, just one quick follow-up. You're, obviously, well positioned in a lot of growing markets, relatively early stage in some of these, how much is technology maturation a risk around just the government's ability to move forward on some of these to the scale in which we'd like to see? Roger Krone : By the way, come to Huntsville, and we'll talk about technology, we'll talk about the technologies in the different products. First of all, we want to have programs across the lifecycle of technology. We're going to be doing work with DARPA, low level TRL kind of programs. When we're starting to talk about production, then those are higher TRL programs. And if I think about, say, if the enduring fires programs, the technology risk is essentially behind us. So, we need to apply the technology, we need to make it work, we need to connect it to the fire control system, we need to take it out on the ranges and shoot it and demonstrate it.  But from an invention standpoint, we do that kind of work under, we call it, 6263 [ph] kind of early stage programs with customers like the Office of Naval Research and AFRL and DARPA. And then, those are take risk, invest, fail fast kind of programs, and we love having those. Our people love working on those, but the ones that are significant in our financials going forward, we've gotten through CDR, PDR, we bought down the technical risk. And I think you'll be impressed with the level of technology we have in those programs and how mature that technology is, if you can make it to Huntsville. Operator : Okay. There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Davis for closing comments. Stuart Davis : Maria, I want to thank you for your assistance on this morning's call. And thank you everyone for joining us this morning and your interest in Leidos. We look forward to updating you again soon. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the conference over to Stuart Davis, from Investor Relations. Mr. Davis, you may now begin. Stuart Davis : Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO, and Chris Cage, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you'll also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we're using today. Turning to Slide 2 of the presentation. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, as shown on Slide 3, we'll discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in today's press release and presentation slides. With that, let me turn the call over to Roger Krone, who will begin on Slide 4. Roger Krone : Thank you, Stuart and thank you all for joining us this morning. [indiscernible], by the way, Happy Valentine's Day. The fourth quarter marked a strong finish to a banner year for Leidos with record revenue and non-GAAP diluted EPS driving us to the top end of our revenue guidance range and beyond our EPS guidance range for the year. Our performance validated that our diversified and resilient portfolio and our investments in technology and innovation are positioning us for growth in key customer missions including digital modernization, cyber, hypersonics and force protection. Each and every day, our 45,000 people are helping our customers execute on important missions and meet the world's most complex challenges. Against the challenging backdrop in 2022, we delivered on our financial commitments, allocated capital to deliver value for our shareholders, won multiple franchise programs that position us for future growth and significantly grew our talent base. So let me provide more detail on each of these points. Number one, our strong financial performance in the fourth quarter enabled us to deliver on our financial commitments. Record revenue of $3.7 billion for the quarter and $14.4 billion for the year, we\u2019re up 6% and 5% respectively. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.7% in the quarter was up 40 basis points year-over-year, which helped drive adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS to a record $1.83, which represents growth of 17%. For the year, adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.4% helped lead to non-GAAP diluted EPS of $6.60, which was well above our guidance. We generated $105 million of cash flow from operations in the quarter and free cash flow of $52 million. For the year, that translates to nearly $1 billion of cash flow from operations and $857 million in free cash flow, which were right at guided levels. These results came despite multiple headwinds, most notably a protracted continuing resolution to start the year inflation, supply chain disruptions and labor constraints. Even at industry leading scale, we\u2019re nimble enough to pivot as needed. And I'm proud of how well the team pulled together and weather these challenges. Number two, in 2022, we allocated capital to deliver value for our shareholders. Over the year, capital deployment was heavily weighted towards return to shareholders, while still layering in strategic acquisition of the Australian airborne business and investing to grow our core business through capital expenditures and internal R&D. With our asset light model, CapEx was just under 1% of revenues with large investments in airborne ISR and Dynetics and we're seeing those investments payoff in additional aircraft performing valuable missions and key wins in hypersonics, which takes me to number three, business development. This year, we won franchise programs in each segment that position us for growth. Programs like DES in Defense, Social Security Administration, IT in Health, and AEGIS in Civil, contributed to performance in 2022 and have built the foundation for 2023 and beyond. They demonstrate our ability to take away work and target brand new opportunities. In the fourth quarter, which is typically the weakest in our industry, we booked $3.7 billion of net awards for our book-to-bill ratio of 1.0. For the year, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.1. Total backlog at the end of the quarter stood at $35.8 billion of which a record $8.4 billion was funded. Total backlog is up 4% and funded backlog is up 13% year-over-year. After a relatively slow start to the year across the industry, contract activity is improving. Most importantly, our submit volume picked up dramatically in the fourth quarter with $23 billion in submits of which 92% was for new business. Taken together, the two Social Security Administration IT task orders that we spoke of last call were the largest award in the quarter. GAO dismissed the competitor's protest earlier than expected and that program has fully ramped. We also won more than $0.5 billion in hypersonics awards, including Mayhem, our first major contract on the air breathing side and wide field of view Tranche 1, which is the backbone of the nation's hypersonics defense capability. We're pleased that so many of you were able to join us in Huntsville last December to get a clear picture of the opportunities that we see at Dynetics. Our Independent research and development investments were critical to procuring these awards just as they were for our landmark wins in digital modernization. In 2022, we invested $116 million in IR&D and IRAD (ph) has grown at a compound annual rate of 23% over the last five years. We continually invest to develop proprietary tools and unique processes to drive competitive advantage. We've already deployed workflow transformations using the latest generation of AI-based on large language models and we're at the leading edge of combining artificial intelligence and cyber to enable our customers to achieve security levels that are beyond compliance. Speaking of cyber, earlier this month, we announced the latest version of our Zero Trust Readiness Level tools suite that simplifies Zero Trust adoption for government organizations, consolidating a six month to nine month planning process to less than 60 days. We drive digital innovations by working tightly with our product partners. For example, we've partnered with Intel Corp. to demonstrate confidential computing through a hardware-based independently attested trusted execution environment. And just last month, we were recognized as the 2023 ServiceNow America's Premier Partner of the Year. Number four, we significantly grew our talent base. We hired more than 2,400 people in the fourth quarter and more than 11,000 in 2022. Headcount was up 6% for the year and attrition rates continue to subside. We've seen great synergy between our people engagement and technology investment initiatives. Employees in our technical upskilling programs have significantly higher retention, and we more than doubled participation in 2022 compared to 2021. Our technical upskilling programs are aligned with our technology strategy and broad participation is enabling us to enhance our competitive position and deepen our culture of innovation. If you want to build your technical skills over a fulfilling career, Leidos is a great place to work. In 2022, we offered courses in artificial intelligence and machine learning, software, cyber, cloud and digital engineering. In 2023, we're expanding with new offerings in cyber operations, secure rapid software development and specialized learning pass in AIML. We also take learning and engagement beyond the classroom. Two weeks from now, we will launch our seventh annual AI Palooza challenge (ph), where employees around the company will engage with some of the newest AIML techniques in a creative and collaborative competition. Perpetual learning is part of our culture and we make it fun. Before turning it over to Chris, I'll touch on the current budget environment. Demand trends are very positive for our business. Late last year, Congress overwhelmingly passed and the President signed the Omnibus Appropriations bill, funding the government through September. Budgets across the board saw healthy increases, including defense spending, which was up about 10%. The budget address the critical challenges we're facing as a nation, including national security concerns arising from China and Russia and Leidos is well-positioned to respond. Amidst a highly partisan backdrop, President Biden's calls in the State of Union address to support Ukraine, protect our country and modernize our military to safeguard stability and deter aggression received strong bipartisan support. That said, we're anticipating a series of noisy debates over the coming months around the debt ceiling and the 2024 appropriations given the razor-thin majorities and the deep divisions in Congress. As a matter of prudence, we are preparing contingency plans around a potential government shutdown. But we built our 2023 guidance, assuming a continuing resolution beginning in October and extending through the rest of the year with no government shutdown. We believe this is the most likely outcome. In summary, I'm pleased with the performance and the momentum of the company. In the fourth quarter, we posted record levels of revenue, non-GAAP diluted EPS and funded backlog as well as the highest adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin and lowest attrition rate for the year. We anticipate that 2023 will be another good year for Leidos, marked by strong hiring, important new wins, solid growth in revenue and operating income. With that, I will turn the call over to Chris for more details on our results and our 2023 outlook. Chris Cage : Thanks, Roger, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Let me echo Roger and express my gratitude to the entire Leidos team for how we executed in 2022. We navigated many challenges throughout the year, including an unexpected adverse arbitration ruling in Q2 to deliver at the top end of our revenue guidance range and above our EPS guidance range for the year, all while delivering for our customers. Turning to Slide 5. Revenues for the quarter were $3.7 billion, up 6% compared to the prior year quarter. For the year, revenues were $14.4 billion, which was up 5% compared to 2021, despite a $107 million headwind from foreign currency movements, primarily from work in the UK and Australia in our Defense Solutions segment. 2022 revenue performance was in-line with the targets that we laid out 16 months ago for '22 through '24. Turning to earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $397 million for the fourth quarter for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.7%, our highest margin of the year and above expectations based on higher growth on more profitable programs, better performance on some large programs and disciplined cost management. 2022 adjusted EBITDA was $1.49 billion for a margin of 10.4% or right at the midpoint of guidance that we've held all year. Non-GAAP net income was $255 million for the quarter and $919 million for the year, which generated non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.83 for the quarter and $6.60 for the year. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 17% for the quarter and essentially flat for the year as a result of some one-time events that we've talked about in the past. Looking at the key drivers below EBITDA. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 20.1%, which was below our expectation and added about $0.09 to EPS. The tax rate benefited from certain international tax credits and limitations, increases in our federal research tax credit and higher than planned stock compensation deductions. In addition, net interest expense in the quarter increased to $51 million from $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Finally, the weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 138 million compared to 142 million in the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of the $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement implemented in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. Now for an overview of our segment results and key drivers on Slide 6. Defense Solutions revenues in Q4 of $2.07 billion were essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter. 2022 Defense Solutions revenues of $8.24 billion were up 3% for the year. Civil revenues were $938 million in the quarter, up 17% compared to the prior year quarter and 2022 revenues were $3.46 billion, up 10% compared to 2021. The primary driver for growth in the quarter and the year was the ramp on the NASA AEGIS program. In addition, we had good growth within our commercial energy business as well as increased security products, sales and maintenance. Health revenues were $691 million for the quarter, an increase of 10% compared to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by performance on DHMSM and our new work on SSA IT. Health revenues were $2.69 billion for the year, up 5% over 2021, with the same drivers that I cited for the quarter plus strong performance on the Military and Family Life Counseling program. On the margin front, on Slide 7, Defense Solutions and Civil posted their highest margins in more than a year based on mix and some excellent program performance. For the quarter, Defense Solutions non-GAAP operating margin came in at 8.6%, up 40 basis points compared to the prior year quarter; and Civil came in at 11.2%, up from 10% in the prior year quarter. Defense Solutions non-GAAP operating margin for the year was 8.3%, which was down 30 basis points from 2021, primarily from investments in new program startups. Civil non-GAAP operating margin for the year was 9.2%, down from 10.2% in the prior year, driven by legal matters that we've addressed in prior calls, a $26 million gain in 2021 and a $19 million expense in 2022. Health non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 14.3%, consistent with what we've been talking about for some time. Health non-GAAP operating margin for the year finished at 17.1%. Turning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 8. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $105 million, and free cash flow, which is net of capital expenditures was $52 million. For the year, operating cash flow was just shy of $1 billion and free cash flow was $857 million for a 94% conversion rate. In the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of the Australian airborne business, which provides maritime surveillance operations for the Australian border force and search and rescue response capability for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, purchase consideration was approximately $190 million, net of $6 million of cash acquired. During the fiscal year 2022, Leidos returned $741 million to shareholders, including $199 million as part of its regular quarterly cash dividend program and $542 million in share repurchases. As of December 30, 2022, the company had $516 million in cash and cash equivalents and $4.9 billion in debt. Roughly $1 billion of that debt will come due in this year. Most of it in May. We expect to fully repay the remaining $320 million on the short-term loan originally tied to the Gibbs & Cox acquisition and then rolled over in support of the ASR program. We'll refinance the $500 million of maturing bonds as well as the bank term loan A still tied to LIBOR in an efficient and flexible manner, but interest expense will increase given the current rate environment. As we approach the debt market, we're pleased with the recent upgrade from Moody's to BAA2 credit rating, which signals their confidence in our financial stability and outlook. We're already benefiting from improved terms on our commercial paper borrowing and expect that to carry through on the debt transactions. As we close out the year, we remain committed to a target leverage ratio of 3 times. Our long-term balanced capital deployment strategy remains the same and consists of being appropriately levered and maintaining our investment grade rating, returning a quarterly dividend to our shareholders, reinvesting for growth, both organically and inorganically and returning excess cash to shareholders in a tax efficient manner. Onto the forward outlook on Slide 9. For 2023, we expect revenues between $14.7 billion and $15.1 billion, reflecting growth in the range of 2% to 5% over fiscal year 2022. Demand remains strong as our customers execute robust budgets, and we enter 2023 with a number of programs that are ramping, but the procurement process is still protracted. We expect 2023 adjusted EBITDA margin between 10.3% and 10.5%. The midpoint of the margin range is the same as 2022. And the top end is consistent with the target that we laid out at our October 2021 Investor Day. We're committed to long-term margin expansion, and we'll pull multiple levers to offset the impact of inflation and supply chain on our cost structure, as we demonstrated in the back half of 2022. We're closely managing our corporate cost with a special focus on real estate. GAAP net income in the quarter reflected impairment charges of $37 million from exiting and consolidating underutilized lease spaces. Since beginning our journey to optimize our real estate footprint post-COVID, we've exited over 2 million square feet, which is about 25% of our office space. Getting out of that space improves our competitiveness and keeps corporate costs in check. We expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for 2023 between $6.40 and $6.80 on the basis of 138 million shares outstanding, which is unchanged from fourth quarter levels. To provide some context around that range, we expect 2023 net interest expense of approximately $225 million and a non-GAAP tax rate between 23% and 24%. These two items amount to an EPS headwind of about $0.20 for the year. Finally, we expect operating cash flow of at least $700 million. This guidance reflects approximately $300 million of additional cash taxes compared to fiscal year 2022, primarily related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 provision requiring the capitalization and amortization of research and development costs. As we're awaiting potential congressional action, we didn't make any Section 174 related tax payments last year. So we'll need to make payments this year to cover both '22 and '23. We paid the 2022 Section 174 taxes in January, and we expect to pay the 23 taxes in quarterly installments throughout the year. From a free cash flow perspective, we're targeting capital expenditures of approximately 1.5% of revenues based on the timing of some investments in Australian and U.S. airborne surveillance as well as in-sourcing some of the security product supply chain. As is our usual pattern, cash generation will be back end weighted in 2023, along with the tax and debt payments in Q1 and Q2, this limits the ability to deploy capital for shareholders in the first half of the year. As a result, the EPS guidance range does not account for any repurchases, and we'll update you as we go throughout the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob, so we can take some questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Robert Spingarn : Hey. Good morning. Roger Krone : Good morning, Rob. Chris Cage : Good morning, Rob. Robert Spingarn : Chris, about the guidance, I wanted to ask you if you might not give us some more detail on a segment basis for the -- what drives the 2% to 5% growth across the segments and then how do the margins look relative to the '22 performance on a segment basis? Chris Cage : Well, Rob, you know that we don't guide by segment, but I'll give you a little additional color commentary. First of all, we're planning on growth across all of our segments. And our leaders have signed up to that. We feel good about that. We're seeing strong demand and pipeline and bid opportunities really across all three segments : Defense Solutions, Civil and Health. On the margin front, we've been communicating this for some time. Health margins were overheated in '20 and '21. Those started to moderate down. You saw that in the fourth quarter that they're coming to a place that we believe is sustainable, and then we can build off of that going forward. So what I would tell you is that's how we see health playing out is in the mid-teens as we've communicated. But we're very focused in the other two segments about continuing to drive margin expansion, Defense Solutions and Civil. So that's generally how we see the year playing out. And hopefully, that gives you enough additional color commentary. Robert Spingarn : Yeah. And then, Roger, going back to the security products business and the supply chain there, what parts of that might you bring in-house? Roger Krone : Some of the manufacturing. We've had -- we've used a contract manufacturer for -- if you think about it for some of the lower level parts and then final assembly of some of the pieces of equipment. And with the Dynetics organization and the expertise we now have -- we're very, very comfortable with doing more of those operations internally. We have more control. We can manage the supply chain. Frankly, we think we can drive the cost down. And that's been part of our strategy, and we are having the conversations about a manufacturing center of excellence which I think really is a great part of the evolution of the company. And so we can look at, if you will, larger manufacturing like the provision system, which I'm sure you all go through and be very confident that we can build that well in-house. Robert Spingarn : Thanks so much. Roger Krone : Yeah. Thanks, Rob. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning, everyone and thank you. Roger Krone : Good morning. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Just a follow-up maybe on health, and I know you don't guide on a segment basis, but can you give us the moving pieces as we think about your growth rate. You mentioned SSA in the quarter starting to contribute RHRP. How do we think about that incremental contribution in 2023? And what you're seeing from burn pit and then the offset from DHMSM? Chris Cage : Well, you nailed all the big players there, Sheila. So you're on top of it. First of all, I mean, the SSA team did an outstanding job, and couldn't be happier with the transition, the fact that the customer did the right thing. Let us get started in the fourth quarter, we're off and running, and we expect that to be a significant contributor to growth in 2023, so that is solid. RHRP, finally, we feel very confident that, that will start to ramp up here really at the tail end of the first quarter. There'll be some activity in March, but think about that as building from Q2 onward through the rest of the year. So that gives us solid growth momentum. [indiscernible] is still again early. I'd say the team is doing excellent work in QTC. The story got a little complicated last year because some of the pre-discharge work went to multiple competitors. We also have the international work that we won that's ramping up this year. So I'd say that's -- we expect growth in that area, but more color on that as we get a quarter or two down the road. And then, finally, DHMSM, this year, there's, I would say, towards the tail end of the year, we've got to continue to work to offset that ramp down on the deployment side, but the teams have been doing excellent work to expand the capabilities within the software that's been deployed. And so we're continuing to find opportunities to do that. I don't know, Roger, if there's anything more you'd add there. Roger Krone : No, not really. Although, Sheila, I'm sure you've heard in the state of union address that the President talked about burn pits and making sure that we took care of veterans. And so it has been slow, but solid and we would expect that momentum to continue throughout the year. That's more likely to affect volume than margin. But we've seen, again, our volume hold up well in our exam business and look forward to another strong year. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay. No, that's helpful. And then I wanted to talk about margins as well, defense was solid in the quarter, but I think it was mainly stable that in Q3 and Q4 have seen really good performance there. So what's sort of going on? You mentioned larger programs, but I didn't think you had anything in particular there. So how do we think about Civil margins going forward and what's the driver of the better performance in the second half of the year? Chris Cage : Well, Civil -- again, we talked a little bit on the prepared remarks about the security products area seeing some ramp up. And that will -- certain quarters will have more volume there. Certain quarters will have less, but that is always a nice contributor. Steady performance in our commercial energy business that has grown nicely quarter-over-quarter. It's higher margin work. Team does an excellent job there. And then just on the digital modernization side, AEGIS coming in, not one of our higher-margin programs, but it's a great base. A lot of employees go into work that helps absorb costs elsewhere, helps make other programs more profitable. And so we like the pipeline of additional digital modernization IT opportunities that we see in that unit as well. And lastly, everybody has been focused on cost management, Sheila, that was kind of the mantra across the company in the back half of the year, the civil team got to give them kudos. They went above and beyond and finding opportunities where they could drive efficiencies sustainably into the organization. And so we like how that performance is trending. Roger Krone : Sheila, I would add, if I could, because I know you followed us for a long time. What's been great about our civil business is that it's growing. And we have a base of business in that segment that is sort of infrastructure support business. We run Antarctica. We've got the Hanford contract. We do some other work for DOE. And as great that work is, it traditionally does not carry the margin of the rest of the company. And so as Civil grows top line, you see the margin increase because we're adding new business sort of at the margin and the mix is shifting in civil. So the more we grow civil and we hold the infrastructure business constant, the more growth in margin you're going to see. And the team there has done a great job of growing. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Great. Thank you very much. Roger Krone : Yeah. Chris Cage : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Bert Subin with Stifel. Please proceed you\u2019re your questions. Bert Subin : Hey. Good morning. Roger Krone : Good morning. Bert Subin : Roger, maybe if I -- or Chris, maybe if I follow up to an earlier question. If we look across the portfolio at Leidos in \u201823 just a couple of items you've got the continued aviation security recovery. You guys noted the growth in commercial energy. You're going to have the annualization of the SSA task orders. You got the [indiscernible] debt. This is just to name a few. All of which I would think would be mid-single growth, mid-single digit organic growth tailwinds. What are the offsetting mechanisms there that puts you down to that 2% to 5% range? Chris Cage : You make it sound so easy, Bert, you're right. There are a lot of tailwinds, no doubt about it. But we\u2026 Roger Krone : We've always talked about the DHMSM program coming off the peak. One of -- by the way, I think one of the real marquee programs for the company, but we're better than half done now, and we will start to slow down as we have talked about in the past. And that program has just been such a great performance program for us, both top line and bottom line and frankly, delivering on time and on schedule to our soldiers. So that's one of the programs that's coming down. Chris Cage : I would also point there's a couple of spots in our Intel business. It's been fairly public, the focus Fox (ph) procurement process. And while that has some room to go ahead of it still to see how that fully plays out. That's an area that could be -- put some pressure on revenue growth if it doesn't go our way. And then, we lost a program a year ago, and this is how long things take called items UFS. And so the good news is the Intel leadership team did a great job throughout 2022 to continue to support the customer during transition, but now we're fully rolled off that program. So that's a little bit of a headwind. But by and large, we've had great success on our recompetes. I really love the team's performance there. There are a lot of tailwinds that are known, but we also have seen customer behavior take longer. And especially if they're worried about the budget environment transitioning into government fiscal year 2024. So our hope is, we'll build momentum through the year. We'll have some successes, and we'll be able to update you in a positive direction. Bert Subin : Yeah. That's super helpful. Thanks. Maybe one item, Roger, that you had talked about before and I thought I gave some good color from DES. Obviously, that has the ability to be a significant driver on the sales side for the company. And you talked about that as being tens of millions of dollars in '22 and then maybe doubling from that range in '23 and then really starting to ramp by \u201924, is that still how you're looking at it or how should we think about the range of potential outcomes for that contract this year? Roger Krone : Yeah. I think that's a good way to build your model. And I was with a customer yesterday, actually, we had a long meeting on the program. We all want to move fast. This is about transitioning non-combat support organizations to new, what we call DoD net. And -- but we want to do it the right way. We want to do it when we're ready, and we all want to move fast because it will save money. It will help interoperability between all these support agencies, but we want to do it the right way. We don't want to create a negative user experience for all the people that are supporting the military. And so the discussion was, well, okay, are we -- can we move up some of the transformations and some of the transitions, and we're looking at that. So I think there is potential for it to be higher, but we're not guiding to that. And we'll talk to you quarter-by-quarter as to what our success has been and whether we've been able to increase the ramp. And I will tell you, we're very enthusiastic about it in '24 and '25. As it fully ramps and we're doing these conversions, how much more than what you described we can do in '23, we have yet to see. But I can tell you, the customer wants to move fast, we want to move fast. But we all know if you -- sometimes you move too fast and you create a negative user experience, you're really not serving the user well, and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Bert Subin : Thanks. Roger Krone : Yeah. Chris Cage : Thanks, Bert. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Matt Akers : Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Roger Krone : Good morning, Matt. Matt Akers : I wanted to ask about the cash flow guidance for '23. And I think if you back out Section 174, I think it's kind of flattish year-over-year. I think the payroll tax goes away in '23. Is there any other sort of offsets to that or working capital maybe that are preventing that from being higher? Roger Krone : Well, again, Matt, with the growth we've had and the growth that we see ahead of us, there are some investments -- modest investments in working capital for a few particular programs. If we're able to win a program like FINS, for example, there's an initial amount of equipment that you have to procure and bring on board to support the customer. So there are a few things like that in our pipeline that we're anticipating. We finished the year at 58 days DSO, and that's good performance. I think there's opportunities to drive that even lower and we're focused on that as a finance team with our lines of business leaders. So we thought we'd start the year at $700 million. I mean it's not a never a slam dunk, but our focus is to continue to build momentum on the cash side. But nothing out of the ordinary as it relates to working capital investment, but there are a few programs that we are anticipating needing some support as we win them and grow them. Matt Akers : Got it. Thanks. And then I guess it sounds like you're doing some sort of contingency planning around if there's a shutdown, are you willing to share what kind of quantify the impact would be if we do get a shutdown? Roger Krone : Well, first of all, no, because we really haven't -- we haven't gotten to that level of planning where we've -- in order to have -- to quantify, we'd have to pick a date and then go through and figure out which programs would be deemed essential and which programs would not be deemed essential, then how we would go mitigating. What we do, and unfortunately, we have done this way too many times as we get our contracts organization, and we go through our 3,000 or so contracts and try to understand how each contract would perform in a government shutdown and some are easy. They're deemed essential. We know those will continue. Some we know will not be deemed essential. And then as part of our preparation, we start to have conversations with contracting officers about things that might be in the middle and work with them on ways that we could mitigate a shutdown. And it just behooves us to be prepared. And by the way, we have learned the better prepared we are, the less likely it is, we'll ever use the plan. but we would never want to maybe McCarthy and the President have a meeting. I think they're going to meet again in a couple of weeks. And if it comes out of that and we get to June, and we're not prepared, then we haven't done our job to manage through a government shutdown as best we can. And that's the process really that we have kicked off. And unfortunately, we have done this before. So we have a pretty well-developed playbook and we have gotten our playbook out and dusted it off. Matt Akers : Thank you. Roger Krone : Yeah. Chris Cage : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed you\u2019re your questions. Peter Arment : Yeah. Good morning, Roger, Chris. Roger Krone : Hey. Good morning, Peter. Peter Arment : Maybe you can just update us on how NGEN is doing. I think we are kind of expected to hit kind of a steady state in 2023 in terms of a ramp. What's your thoughts on that? Roger Krone : NGEN? Peter Arment : Yeah. Roger Krone : Well, it's pretty much fully ramped. And you're really doing well. We're in full possession of the network Peter, I know you know the program well, but our first task was to take the custodianship of the Asure Network, okay? So we've done that. Now the challenge is to transform that network to modern technology. And we're in the process of keeping the call center up, maintaining the network, trying to get the quality of service up while we move to the new environment. And there is opportunity, we believe, this year for additional scope through special projects and on-contract growth in task orders. And we are starting to see some of that. I think we have talked in prior calls that was a little slow in coming. But we have talked to the Navy and frankly, I've talked to our program manager, and we're starting to see some of that break free. We see lots of opportunities where technology can add value to the user experience in the Navy. And so we're constantly making suggestions to the customer about things that can be done to improve the network and which would end up in growth for us, but more importantly, would end up in better quality of service for the user. I don't know, Chris, do you want to add? Chris Cage : No. I mean, first of all, we've got an outstanding team running that program. And it's our largest program, as you can imagine, and we're only a year, 18 months into this thing. So the best days are ahead of it. To Roger's point, we're clearly identifying areas where there we can help support the mission and the customer better and that would lead to contractual actions and modifications. And let's just say, of course, we're interested in pursuing that, but at the pace that makes sense for the customer. So we're hopeful that there's -- we'll continue to see growth and margin improvement around that program as it moves into next year and the year after. Peter Arment : I appreciate that color. Hey, Roger, you mentioned technology kind of insertions and things that AI has obviously gained a lot in the press here recently with chat GPT (ph) and other things. Are you seeing opportunities to really automate some parts of your business where you can really potentially improve margins? Roger Krone : Absolutely. And Peter, we're all smiling because we actually do have chat GPT in our environment, and we debated whether we ought to talk about it. And it seems such a popular term now and I guess Microsoft is going to put it under being and really make a super search engine out of it. But I think what everyone needs to understand is those technologies are available to anyone who wants to use them. And I think the benefit goes to those people who capitalize on not only the money we spend internally, but the billions of technology money that's spent outside the company. And so we are very aggressively using things like chat GPT and other modern language AI platforms. And we've deployed robotic process automation in accounting, like in Chris' area. I mean we don't talk much about that. We're certainly doing it for customers. We're using it. I like to analyze images and all the applications that you can imagine. But we're also using it internally in our functions to be able to, if you will, use computers to do what we call the dull, the dirty and the dangerous, right, and free up the human, whether that be a financial analyst or an accountant or an imagery analyst or even a linguist, right, in our linguistic. Program do what the human does best, which is to add that cognitive discernment and then let the computers crunch through the gigabytes and petabytes and terabytes of data that we now collect. Peter Arment : Appreciate the details. Thanks, Roger. Roger Krone : Thanks, Peter. Operator : The next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Seth Seifman : Hey. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Roger Krone : Good morning. Seth Seifman : I was wondering maybe if you could talk a little bit about the '23 Omnibus and kind of how that's set up your expectations for the growth that should be coming in the Dynetics programs, particularly in the 2024 time frame? Roger Krone : Yeah. Okay. Those are -- you two, I would say, lightly linked subject. So let me talk through them and I'll have Chris clean up after me when I make a mistake. But given the year and what's going on, on the Hill, I think the Omnibus is about the best we can expect. And my hope and our plan is McCarthy, the President find a way to raise the debt ceiling long before the June date. And the debt is really paying for past years for authorizations and appropriations that have already been made, commitments that the country has been made, and we're just funding the government. And that will probably fund it we're hoping a little bit higher than the 2023 levels. I think we can count on that. And as you know, it's always a discussion between defense and nondefense, and if we raise defense, then there's a group of elected officials who want to raise the non-defense budget at the equal amount. And that may tamp down a little bit of the raise in defense, but we're coming off such a robust defense budget this year that I think we will all do okay. Now how does that roll into Dynetics? And again, if you were down in Huntsville and I'll describe a little bit what you would have seen is a lot of productions that are in low rate initial stage of the program, where we're building the first age preproduction or production units that will be followed in '24 by a fairly aggressive ramp and significant production. We're talking instead of one a month, one a week, two a week. And we could go through the different programs. I won't do that now. Those monies are pretty much already authorized and appropriate, okay? Not in every case, I won't go program by program, but if we get an omnibus then the ramp that we talked about in December is certain because these are programs of records that will be fully funded. I won't go into all the scenarios if there's a debt ceiling or there's a reason and all the things that the government could do, which is certainly within the realm of possible. We think the high probability is they'll get an omnibus. It will have some growth in it. There may be a Ukraine supplemental depending upon how it goes and it certainly doesn't appear to be lessening. So they may cover those expenses with the supplemental as they have done in the past. And then our production ramps in '24, which are again, we think we're very pleased. I think they're very attractive. Those would be fully funded and we would see significant growth in Dynetics in '24, and I'll let Chris add to that. Chris Cage : Not a lot to add. I mean, Seth, obviously, you can tell from Roger's comments, which were mostly focused towards the future \u201824 we felt really good about how '23 Omnibus came out, and our Leidos affairs team does an excellent job, and we clearly were making sure members understood the importance of some of our key programs. And we like the way we came out. You don't get everything funded at the level that you'd like. But on balance, we thought we came out exceptionally well and well protected with key programs and that sets us up nicely for this year. Seth Seifman : Cool. Excellent. Okay. I\u2019ll leave it there for this morning. Thanks very much. Chris Cage : Thank you. Operator : Next question coming from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Kenneth Herbert : Yes. Hi. Good morning. Chris Cage : Hey. Good morning. Kenneth Herbert : Maybe for Chris or Roger, you did a really nice job sort of sequentially first half to second half in '22 on the margins. And I know you went through a number of items around your physical footprint, some insourcing, maybe some labor savings. But it also sounds like from the guide that in your comments that you're obviously not going to keep all of this. My question would be, how do you view sort of incremental sort of corporate level cost opportunities as you look at the business into '23? And how is the discussion with the customer in terms of how much you're able to keep, what's necessary to be competitive and win share in the marketplace? I mean how do you view these dynamics into '23? And where are the incremental opportunities at the corporate level from the cost side? Chris Cage : Well, Ken, let me get started. Roger might pile on. So first of all, very proud of the team, second half of the year as a team, we really rallied and showed we're capable of on the cost control, margin improvement front. And quite honestly, that was despite the fact that we had some program areas where we could have done better. And so I think that gives us some confidence and momentum going into '23. Now a couple of things to keep in mind. The Health Group overall for the year finished still above 17% on margins. right? So fourth quarter was definitely more in line with what expectations are going forward. But earlier in the year, there was still some stronger performance from caseload and QTC and other things that drove that higher. So that will still moderate down a bit, but we do intend to capture the savings and the margin upside that we've been able to realize in other parts of the business. And we're not done in Defense Solutions and in civil for sure. And as we build our pricing, we have a rigorous process with our competitive intelligence team to kind of keep us in tune with where we need to be on a price to win front. We factor that in and making sure that we can remain competitive while still trying to capture some of the margin upside. So the guidance is balanced for next year. And again, there's momentum there. I wouldn't say there's any super low-hanging fruit on the cost reduction side because we do focus on that continuously. But there's still more that we can do, and we're focused on hitting that 10.5% long-term margin target or greater by 2024. Roger Krone : Yeah. I don't have much to add, Ken. I'll make a couple of points that I'm not sure we get the food stomp. So taxes and interest which I wish I could control, but I don't. That's like a $0.20 headwind on EPS. And we'll do all we can, and we've got a great tax department, and we'll see if we can mitigate that. Unfortunately, interest rates are up and the way we manage our balance sheet, we're in the market, we're always replacing expiring debt instruments, and so that creates a headwind. But really, our philosophy is if we can grow revenue faster than we grow our indirect costs, then we get better every year. And so growing the top line has really helped us control costs. We had really good growth in the second half. Again, we expect continuous growth for the rest of this year. And then the challenge is to control costs below revenue growth, but we've found -- like we have some costs that grow with the number of people right? And so one of our thoughts are we've had a business that was somewhat dependent on people to grow, right? And we've talked in the past about, well, we want a little bit more product mix. We wanted a little bit more diversity in our portfolio. Part of that is so that we can grow nonlinear with people -- and so if we have -- we get to the ramp in Dynetics where we're building more products, we can leverage our terrific workforce, but it's not one to one, and that allows us to grow faster than our indirect rates, and you can think about HR and benefits and all the things, the training programs that we have with our people. So that's just kind of our philosophy. And I think Chris did a good job of saying, we got fixed price and cost plus. And I'm sure you know how the mechanics are about what we have to give back based upon the contract type. Kenneth Herbert : Great. I\u2019ll stop there and pass it back. Thanks, Roger. Thanks, Chris. Roger Krone : Yeah. Chris Cage : Thanks, Ken. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your questions. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Thanks so much. So I think early on, you talked about 6% headcount growth, and I would have to assume wages go up about 3% which would say payroll is up in the area of 9%, and your revenues are up 2% to 5%. Help us square those two items? Chris Cage : Well, Cai, I mean, keep in mind, first of all, half of our revenue is kind of Leidos content. We've got subcontractors. We've got materials, right? So that's only a portion of the business that you're focused on the headcount growth. And that headcount growth that Roger talked about, the 2,400 people that we brought on last year was over the course of the year, right? We were adding them kind of pro rata throughout the year. So it's not like that's going to all be incremental heading into '23. But that being said, we have big plans around the additional heads that we plan on adding again this year. So the combination of factors, headcount should be up. You're correct. There's payroll growth on top of that, that gives you some upside, that immediately gets passed through on the cost reimbursable programs. You don't necessarily get uplift immediately on your fixed price programs. But that's part of the equation, too, that would suggest, if we're successful, we don't have any major losses, and we continue to win our fair share, we like the momentum that we see on the growth side. Cai von Rumohr : Thanks. And the second one is, you have very strong bid submits. And Roger, you mentioned we have a very strong FY '23 budget. So there's lots of money available. Can you give us some color on what you expect your book-to-bill might be in '23 and what that would suggest for '24? Roger Krone : Yeah. Sure, Cai. And, of course, it's early. And we've got about $34 billion of submits pending awards. And we had -- I don't know whether our submits of $23 billion last quarter was a record or not. I think it probably was. So we've got just a lot of things out there. And so we expect '23 to be at or better where we were in '22. And it's so early -- we start leaning forward and then we get hit with the protest and the program gets pushed out of \u201823 to \u201824, which we've certainly seen happen in the past. But we feel that '23 is going to be strong. And the '22 levels or better. There's always a couple of wild cards. It says you would win. There are a couple, I would say, maybe more sort of like 1 square over that we could win that would really fuel the top end. We didn't really put those in our plans and our guide. What we're trying to do is to build a balanced guide around what we see in the portfolio. And again, clearly above one for the year, again, as it has been for years and years and years, but the potential for a very strong year. And then we'll just -- we've got fans, which still hasn't been awarded and we're hopeful that FIS will be awarded soon. I'll tell you, Cai, without going into the details, there's a program that has been under protest that we thought would be awarded in first quarter. And the customer just asked us to extend our pricing to next year. So there's -- as enthusiastic as we are. Every once in a while, we do get disappointed and the protest process and the adjudication court of federal claims tends to damp down some of our enthusiasm. And so in the first quarter, we're going to be thoughtful about what we put out there. But you know the number, 35, 36 in backlog, 34 awaiting award, our strong submits. And we'll have a very strong submit year in '23 as well. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you very much. Chris Cage : Thanks, Cai. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Gursky with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Jason Gursky : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just want to follow up there with kind of a follow-up question to the line of thinking that Cai had there on the bookings. You mentioned in your prepared remarks the protracted acquisition process that's in place. That's something we've been hearing for quite some time now. I'm wondering if this is just kind of the normal environment now? And what your assumptions are for the year? Are you expecting things to get better or worse on how quickly things can get out the bid and then awarded? Roger Krone : Yeah. I mean, I'll talk kind of top level. Chris can add in. And this is, just what I think. So everybody has their opinion there's a lot that's being written is what I think I'm seeing is customers wanting to get things under contract before we end up in this argument over the debt ceiling. With looming government shutdown, who knows what comes out of those discussions. If you've got a customer and you've got appropriated funds, you're going to really work hard to get those committed between now and June. And so we are seeing a little bit more activity, and we're hopeful that these folks will try to move a little faster and get these things under contract. And then we probably end up with an agreement on debt ceiling with some kind of a future trade on some kind of a top level budget constraint. I mean I don't -- I'm not smart enough to know what that will look like. Last time this happened, we got sequester. But I suspect it will be something just what I read about how McCarthy got elected as a speaker, there is some kind of a budget deal that's going to be cut for the long term. But that could be by -- and I don't really understand how you balance the budget in 10 years. Again, that's not my job, but I run the numbers, and it seems unbelievably difficult. But that's going to put a damper perhaps on what the budget could be. You're starting to talk now 25%, right? And so I suspect that if you have money and you have a program and you have a mission with requirements, you're going to work as hard as you can to get those things committed in '23. And I think that speaks well. And then as you know, we get an award in '23 that's a '24, '25, '26 revenue. So again, our future, we think, is still looks relatively bright. And then plus the diversity in our portfolio, the Civil group has been growing very strongly. The health group has been growing very strongly. So we've been working really hard to make Leidos somewhat resistant to the vagaries of what happens from our elected officials. I don't know, Chris, you want to add anything? Chris Cage : No, I think you covered it well. I mean the only thing I'd say, we wish customer contracting shops were more fully staffed. They're not in many cases. One path that we think has been successful is more use of Fed Sim. Fed Sim runs a good acquisition process. the rules are well defined. And so we've had some success with our teams competing in that arena, and we see more customers going in that direction. Jason Gursky : Okay. And then quick clarification. Can I ask one clarification. You mentioned the CapEx at 1.5% this year. And I think you mentioned part of that is being driven by Australia. I'm just curious if that has to do with the recent acquisition and kind of what's going on down there, specifically on. Chris Cage : Yeah. Good question, Jason. So it does. When we acquired that -- the Australian Airborne business, we knew they were kind of halfway through a major investment in the mission management system software capability. We're continuing that investment. So that will be completed in '23, but that was fully factored in the valuation of the business. And so that's elevated for a period of time. Then as you know, I mean, just like the rest of Arbor business, there will be some preventative maintenance, ongoing normal maintenance CapEx that we'll spend there over time. But think of that as slightly elevated in '23, just to continue the full development of that capability. And then we've got additional CapEx in that number for our U.S. based airborne business as we're acquiring more capability, fitting it out to run more mission, and we're optimistic on some bids that we've put forward and some more that are in the pipeline there. Jason Gursky : Great. Thank you. Chris Cage : Thanks, Jason. Stuart Davis : Hey, Rob, we're running a little bit over, but we have time for one quick question. Operator : Sure. That will be coming from the line of Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Louie DiPalma : Roger, Chris, Stuart and Gabe, good morning. Chris Cage : Good morning. Roger Krone : Good morning. Louie DiPalma : The success of drones in Ukraine and more recently, surveillance balloons have increased Congress's focused on unmanned systems last summer, on a $300 million contract to develop a medium unmanned undersea vehicle for the Navy and your unmanned surface vessels Sea Hunter and Shaw have participated in several successful demonstrations. Is there potential, Roger, for some of these Navy unmanned platforms to convert to programs of record or even for Leidos to provide surveillance as a service similar to the cocoa model that you're doing in the U.S. and in Australia? Thanks. Roger Krone : Yes. Well, that's great. I mean Louie, you really are following things well, and I think you really understand our programs. I would add to that, we have some unmanned vehicles that are made of Dynetics. By the way, we have some counter drone programs that we probably exposed to a little bit to when you were down in Huntsville, where we actually have a radar on Jeep and we launch a drone, and it can go -- or attack another drone. And so -- but we see exactly what you see is the use of uninhabited vehicles under the water on the surface in the air, and we'll call it in the rare air, up between 60,000 and 80,000 has -- first of all, I will tell you that it has been robust. There's been a lot of work already done. The MUUV is a program of record. So we won that, that's a program of record that's fully funded. The Sea Hunter and the autonomous vehicles in the Navy are not yet programs of record but the Navy is doing a lot of experimentation. They're doing some things in the Mid-East that have really demonstrated some capabilities. As you have mentioned, we've done a lot with Sea Hunter Sea Hawk and Sea Innovator. And we believe there is a strong demand for those. I think for us, on the surface. The next thing for us may not be a full program of record, but they may buy additional vehicles to extend their experimentation, which they can do under an OTA that would happen much faster. But I believe that the Navy is committed to having a significant percentage of their fleet both unmanned and optionally manned. And our autonomy software and the things that we have demonstrated really set us up well to capitalize on that and to bring them the capability that they need. There are a couple of other programs. There's MUSV, there's LUSV that are out there. They are going through their development processes. But to get all the way to the program of record, I think, is years away, but that doesn't mean that the Navy won't be spending funds to further their understanding and to experiment with unmanned capabilities, and we would be right in the middle of those activities. So Louie, thanks for the question. Louie DiPalma : Thanks, Roger. Thanks everyone. Roger Krone : Yeah. Operator : At this time, I'll turn the floor back to Stuart Davis for closing remarks. Stuart Davis : Thank you, Rob, for your assistance on this morning's call, and thank you all for your time this morning and your interest in Leidos. We look forward to updating you again soon. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings. Welcome to the Leidos First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the conference over to Stuart Davis, from Investor Relations. Mr. Davis, you may now begin. Stuart Davis : Thank you, Rob. And good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our first quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO, and Chris Cage, our Chief Financial Officer.  Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website where you'll also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll use during today's call. Turning to slide 2 of the presentation. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, as shown on slide 3, during the call, we'll discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in today's press release and presentation slides. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone, who will begin on slide 4. Roger Krone : Thank you, Stuart. And thank you all for joining us this morning. Our first quarter results demonstrate our ability to drive strong organic growth as record revenue performance was consistent with our long-term target. We expect earnings and cash performance to build momentum as we progress through the year and are fully committed to achieving our 2023 guidance.  As I step down as CEO, I am confident that Leidos is truly the leader in our industry with unmatched talent, technical depth, and market facing solutions. Our dedicated team is at the forefront of our customers' most challenging missions as we make the world safer, healthier, and more efficient.  As usual, I'll touch on our financial performance, capital allocation, business development performance, and people.  Number one, our top line financial performance for the quarter was excellent. Record revenues of $3.7 billion were up 6% in total and over 5% organically year-over-year. Our growth is in line with our long term model, and we continue to take share from our competitors. All three of our segments grew led, by Civil and Health, which speaks to the power of our diversified portfolio.  Bottom line performance was lower than anticipated, largely driven by delays in security product deliveries and continued investment in the security product offerings. The delays based primarily on supply chain issues and customers site readiness are fundamentally a matter of timing and will be resolved within the year. The strengths that we're seeing across the Leidos portfolio, especially in the Health business, will help to accelerate margin and earnings performance throughout the year.  As planned, cash generation was decreased by the cash tax payments for Section 174 expense for 2022 and the final payment on the CARES Act deferral. Absent those unusual items, cash flow from operations was consistent with last year's levels. We remain on track to generate more than $700 million of operating cash flow this year.  Which brings me to point number two on capital allocation. Our long term balanced capital deployment strategy has always consisted of being appropriately levered and maintaining our investment grade rating, returning a quarterly dividend to our shareholders, reinvesting for growth, both organically and inorganically, and returning excess cash to shareholders in a tax efficient manner.  We've committed to take down our gross leverage ratio to 3 times and we expect to achieve that by the end of the year. In the first quarter, we refinanced and extended our debt to position us to deploy capital in productive ways. We view our strong balance sheet and investment grade rating as a strategic asset in the current market.  The cash tax payments and upcoming debt paydown limited our ability to deploy capital in the quarter, but we resolutely believe that our current valuation is not aligned with our fundamental earnings power and cash generation. Therefore, we bought back $25 million of shares through open market repurchases in the first quarter. As we ramp free cash generation in the second half of the year, we'll create flexibility to allocate capital to benefit long term shareholders. Number three, business development. Most importantly, award activity is returning to normal levels after a protracted period marked by procurement delays and obligations under running budget authority. A more active environment bodes well for Leidos with our long history of being able to thrive in a competitive market.  In the quarter, we exceeded our gross awards plan and booked a net of $3 billion in awards for a net book-to-bill of 0.8. Total backlog at the end of the quarter stood at $35.1 billion. Of that, $8.3 billion was funded, which is up 17%.  You can read about some of the key awards from the quarter in the press release, but we're particularly pleased to see the intelligence community customers making awards again. Maritime continues as a focus item for us and international airport security is beginning to rebound.  To ensure that we bring true differentiation to our bids, we continue to invest in strategic technologies that are core to our business. Last quarter, I talked about cyber, zero trust, confidential compute, and generative AI. We also have a rich history of delivering secure software at speed to support critical missions. We protect the software supply chain from development to deployment to operations, delivering software security that goes beyond compliance for customers like the FAA, DoD and DHS. And we're investing in cutting edge emerging quantum technologies focused on applications, such as quantum augmented communications and the transition to quantum resilient cybersecurity.  We see tremendous opportunities ahead. We have $30 billion in submits awaiting adjudication, and we expect to submit another $39 billion over the remainder of the year. Based on the successful Tranche 0 launches in April and the rapid Tranche 1 timeline, the Space Development Agency is accelerating the Wide Field of View program, so Tranche 2 should be a 2023 submit.  We also expect expanded follow-on bids on our force protection and hypersonics programs this year. In addition, we're pursuing large supply chain modernization efforts for the army and the Veterans Administration, and digital transformation remains a key priority for our customers.  And lastly, point number 4, Lighthouse continues to be an attractive destination for talented people. In the first quarter, we hired more than 2,500 people and increased headcount 7% year-over-year. Even more important, voluntary attrition has dropped down to pre pandemic levels. This improved labor position provides potential uplift to our revenue plan.  We're benefiting from the improved labor market for technical talent, but we believe our focus on employee engagement and career development is also a major positive factor. Our managers are living their commitments to Leidos Life by putting their employees careers, flexibility and wellbeing first. They are connecting with their teams and taking the time to engage with their employees around building a career. In our recently completed employee engagement survey, we were above external benchmarks across almost all categories, scoring particularly strong on manager relationships, inclusion and diversity, and employee growth and development. If you want to join an inclusive team and build your skills over a fulfilling career, Leidos is a great place to work.  Before turning it over to Chris, I'll touch on the current federal budget environment. The US Congress is currently debating President Biden's $6.9 trillion budget request for physical year 2024. The proposed budget includes increases in critical areas that are important to Leidos, such as defense, transportation, Veterans Affairs, NASA, and energy. Last week, House Republicans passed a bill that would raise the debt ceiling and cap discretionary spending. The bill will not pass the Senate, but discussions can now begin in earnest towards resolving the debt ceiling and the government physical year 2024 budget given the enormous challenges that we have as a nation.  Finally, I want to speak to the CEO transition. As I look back on my nine years at Leidos, I am proud to say that we have achieved incredible transformation and growth together, almost tripling revenues and establishing ourselves as a premier broad technology provider. Our strong leadership team helped us win numerous large competitor programs in the US and abroad. We completed transformational acquisitions, including integrating Lockheed Martin's Information Systems & Global Solutions business, which enabled us to expand our capabilities and better serve our customers. Our efforts have not gone unnoticed as we have been recognized as a leader in our industry, providing innovative solutions to complex challenges.  Our commitment to our employees has been a top priority, and we have fostered a culture of innovation, engagement and inclusion. We have built a team that is passionate about our mission, vision and values, and conveys that commitment to our customers.  Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we took care of each individual and prioritized safety and wellbeing above all. Our focus on collaboration, innovation, and inclusion has allowed us to create a culture that enables each employee to grow and thrive, driving our success.  We have also made a significant impact on our customers and communities. We have transformed logistics for the UK Ministry of Defense, enabling them to rapidly respond to the crisis in Ukraine. We have driven IT innovation throughout government and helped more than 200 utilities across the US build a more resilient, reliable and sustainable electric grid. We have modernized healthcare information management across the Department of Defense on cost and on schedule, and enabled our veterans to get the disability benefits they have earned through their service. And we have worked in our communities to confront opioid addiction and remove stigmas associated with mental health challenges, making a positive difference in the lives of many.  The driving force behind our company's prosperity is undoubtably the exceptional talent of our employees and the unwavering strength of our leadership team. Without their incredible contributions, we would not be where we are today. I am confident, with this team in place, Leidos is poised for continued growth in the future.  As I transition out of my CEO role, I'm excited to welcome Tom Bell to the position. I have worked with Tom over the past months, and I am convinced he is the right person to lead this company into the future. With a great foundation in place at Leidos, I believe that Tom's tenure will be rewarding for our employees, customers, suppliers, and shareholders.  I will end by saying thank you to each of you for your confidence you've showed in me during my tenure. It has been an honor of a lifetime. Thank you. Chris Cage : Thank you, Roger. And thank you to everyone for joining us today. Let me begin by echoing Roger's assessment of the team. This management team is laser focused on delivering on our financial commitments and driving above market growth across all financial metrics over the long term.  Turning to slide 5. Revenues for the quarter were $3.7 billion, up 6% compared to the prior-year quarter. Revenues grew organically across all three reportable segments, given strong demand across our customer sets, robust hiring, and better retention.  Our growth came despite a $24 million negative impact from foreign currency movements. At current foreign exchange rates, FX will become a tailwind sometime in our second quarter.  Turning to earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $346 million for the first quarter for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.4%. Non-GAAP net income was $205 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.47. Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS were down 8% and 7%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.  I'll get to the underlying drivers next, but let me be clear. The he shortfall to the level of performance we expect from this company is temporary, concentrated and recoverable. Turning to those segment drivers on slide 6. Defense Solutions revenues increased 3% compared to the prior-year quarter. The largest growth catalysts were the Navy NGEN and SDA Wide Field of View Tranche 1 contracts, as well as the Australian airborne acquisition.  For the quarter, Defense Solutions non-GAAP operating income margin increased to 8.4%, up 30 basis points from the prior-year quarter, with better program performance and growth in higher margin areas such as airborne surveillance.  Health revenues increased 9% over the prior-year quarter, driven by growth on the Social Security Administration IT work and another strong quarter on the DHMSM program. Non-GAAP operating income margin came in at 15.9%, which was up 160 basis points sequentially and at the high end of the mid-teens range we've talked about, bolstered by additional disability exam volume and excellent program execution.  Civil revenues increased 10% compared to the prior-year quarter. The NASA AEGIS program was the largest driver and we also saw increased demand from our commercial energy customers.  Civil non-GAAP operating income margin was 6.4% compared to 7.7% in the prior year quarter and 11.2% in the last quarter. The decrease in segment profitability, which led to the sequential and year-over-year declines at the enterprise level, was focused in our security products business, driven by three main factors. First, certain of our existing programs were delayed due to customers not meeting their scheduled commitments. They were unable to take possession of equipment because they had not yet completed site preparation. Second, supply chain disruptions led to higher component prices or shortages, which then impacted maintenance schedules and triggered penalties under certain service level agreements. Third, we're investing in enhancements to our product suite, particularly around our Mosaic software platform, which integrates all security components into a single management system. This innovation was key to our recent awards at Frankfurt and Luton Airport. Most of the fixes have already been implemented or are in process. We've reconfigured inventory management and rationalized our service provider network. We're working with customers on scheduling and expect that orders in our backlog will be delivered and accepted this year. And we're taking actions to ensure that our investment and delivery model are rightsized to withstand the lumpiness that's inherent in a product driven business.  Turning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on slide 7. Operating cash flow for the quarter was a use of $98 million and free cash flow was a use of $137 million. As expected and communicated, cash flow for the quarter was reduced by $191 million in tax payments for prior year activities, primarily related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 provision requiring the capitalization and amortization of research and development costs.  Cash collections were in line with our expectations and normal Q1 levels. For example, DSOs were at 62 days, which is a one day improvement from a year ago. We're on a path to take out at least four days over the course of the year, consistent with our usual pattern. Cash generation is a major focus item across the company, involving not only finance, but contracts, business development and program management, and we expect to drive sustainably improved performance over time.  During the first quarter, we returned $93 million to shareholders, including $25 million in open market share repurchases, $18 million in repurchases related to incentive compensation transactions, and $50 million through our ongoing dividend program.  During the quarter, we also strengthened our balance sheet, increased our financial flexibility. We issued $750 million of 10-year bonds with a fixed rate of 5.75%, refinanced our Term Loan A and revolver, and paid off the $500 million note that was due in May. On balance, we put more of our debt on long term bonds and less on the term loan, while upsizing our revolver to $1 billion. With strong demand, we were able to price the transaction at very favorable terms in the current rate environment. Once we repay the remaining $320 million on the short term loan, originally tied to the Gibbs & Cox acquisition, our next tranche of debt doesn't come due until 2025.  On to the forward outlook. We're maintaining our guidance from the Q4 call. Specifically, we expect 2023 revenues between $14.7 billion and $15.1 billion, adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.3% to 10.5%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $6.40 and $6.80, and cash from operations at $700 million or greater. With three quarters to go, we believe the current ranges still encompass the likely outcomes for the year.  Revenue, margins and cash should all build throughout the year. As Roger mentioned, strong demand and an improving labor market support revenue growth. Margins will improve through a combination of resolving the issues around the security products business, opportunities within the Health segment, most notably increased medical examinations tied to the PACT Act, appropriate cost reductions and normal seasonality in our portfolio. As is our usual pattern, cash generation will be back-end weighted in 2023 with a spike in the third quarter, which is the end of the government fiscal year. In closing, I want to publicly thank Roger for his leadership over these nine years, both in transforming this company and providing valuable mentorship to me. He's hard to replace, but I look forward to welcoming Tom Bell and introducing him to the investment community over the coming months.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob, so we can take some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Now our first question is from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Robert Spingarn : I think I wanted to start with something kind of high level and has been talked about a lot this quarter so far. But we have these recent leaks of intelligence documents. And I'm just wondering, Roger, if you think that's going to slow down the approval process for security clearances or it may inhibit the ability of folks to do their jobs as efficiently as possible? Or, on the other hand, could it provide work, could it provide upside for companies like Leidos as DoD tries to resecure its systems or its process? Roger Krone : Well, shall we look back in history at the period of time around the Snowden leaks. And I'm a believer, at least in general, that history repeats itself. And it made things more difficult. The timeline to get clearances expanded the depth of background investigations, the level of clearance required to do certain jobs where maybe we were on a path for that to be relaxed, maybe like one notch, I suspect it will go the other way. Access to information will be held tighter.  First of all, any leak like this is a really bad thing. And it hurts our military, it hurts our country, it hurts our standing in the international community. So I don't really see anything positive, to be quite honest, Rob, coming out of it. There are some companies, not us, that do background investigations, who do polygraphs, we're not in that business. We are a recipient of clearances. And I can't imagine that this is going to make the clearance process any easier. In fact, I suspect it's going to go in the opposite direction. And I cannot believe, my career, 46 years in the business, that after Snowden that we're back here again with his problem, and it's very, very unfortunate. Robert Spingarn : Maybe a little bit shorter term looking. You mentioned the procurement and award activity is picking up. Do you think that this is due to some acquisition officials trying to get ahead of the debt ceiling fight and the perturbations that could come from that? Roger Krone : I really do. It's the debt ceiling. We've talked a lot about a CR that could go well into 2024. And so, for people who have program managers, government contracting officials who have authorizations, appropriations and what have you to get a program under contract before we hit the fall season, I think there's a lot of that going on. And by the way, it's a positive thing. I think all the political posturing around the debt ceiling and the budget \u2013 I know the President is going to have a sort of a budget summit in the next few days. Hopefully that will lead to something positive. But there is a positive outcome to that, which is we've had some programs that have been in the acquisition process for years and they're starting to get awarded and adjudicated, and that's a positive thing. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Sheila Kahyaoglu : I want to maybe ask, first, on the supply chain comments you made within Civil and the security business there. I think your nearest peer there, OSI, grew 13% organically and margins went up. So what kind of changes in your business specifically? Seems like you have some investments in Mosaic. And how do we kind of assume that progressive? Chris Cage : There's definitely some positives going on in the business. And again, the one contract that was impacted by customer driven delays, we've been executing on that back half of last year and there's plenty of runway ahead of us to continue to execute on that, which will help drive growth.  The supply chain challenges were disappointing, and there's some component parts and some CPUs, et cetera, that are sourced by various suppliers, some in China, and really just hit us this quarter especially hard because as activity levels have ramped up, we weren't able to supply some components and sales that we would have been able to realize. And then missing some service levels impacted us from a disincentive perspective. So I think the team, they've been working hard and they're getting some additional support from our corporate procurement organization. And so, we're all in on making sure we've got more redundancy in that supply chain. And we've already made some changes, swapped out third party logistics provider. So that transition has happened in the quarter and, again, we're taking the appropriate actions to position that for growth.  There were some positives. We talked about Frankfurt Luton, there's been some nice awards on the aviation product side, and continue to see a pipeline of activity there. So confident the team's going to get it turned around. Roger Krone : Sheila, we're doing some other things, we're bringing more production inhouse where we have more control. We're going to stand up a new facility that we're really excited about. We did have some licensing delays in the period that affected some of the maintenance work that we did. And I don't know why in the quarter, everything seemed to hit us. But the good news is, the business is coming back, air travel is coming back, the long term prospect for SES is really, really positive. And we're bullish on the future. I have the privilege of being involved in some other companies outside of Leidos and they have had these supply chain issues, especially around general purpose processors. And you think you have it nailed down, and then it's the $5 chip that gets you and we had some of that in our own business. Very, very low end stuff that we had reliable supplier, and then we ended up being gapped.  The business didn't go away. It's in backlog. We'll get our supply chain where it needs to be, and we'll deliver this product in the remaining three quarters of the year. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Maybe one more on Health, if you don't mind. You called out DHMSM as a contributor in the quarter. It continues to grow despite what we think of it peaking in 2023. So how could we kind of think about the revenue expectations for that program over time? Chris Cage : Chris here again. And I would say our expectation is, again, the tail end of this year, last quarter especially, you'll see that begin to tail down, teams working really hard and continue to do exceptionally well. And Rogers prepared remarks, the on-cost and on-schedule can't be overstated. And so, the customer has trust in us and there are additional capabilities we're working to deliver there. But Health is a bigger story than just DHMSM and we're proving that. The SSA work, the pipeline strength, what we're seeing out of the disability exam business, very pleased with how Liz Porter and the team have positioned that business. This quarter, 15.9% margins, got to the levels that we committed to and actually see more upside at this point in time than we had previously expected.  So, it's in a good spot. And even to withstand the DHMSM ramp down, the RHRP contract is now active and didn't contribute much of anything in the quarter. So we'll see more meaningful contributions beginning in Q2 from that program. So that's what's going on in Health. Roger Krone : Sheila, I'll give you kind of this longer term view of DHMSM. So we have been focused on rolling out the starter [ph], now Oracle software to the military treatment facilities, and that has what has driven top line. As we are near the end of the rollout, the discussions we're having with the customer is now on the experience of the people who use it. And to enhance that, to make it more doctor and nurse friendly, to provide patient access through patient portals, right, and then to capture the data. Right? Many of the people on the call have kind of lived the journey from paper records to electronic healthcare records through the HITECH Act, something called Meaningful Use 1 and Meaningful Use 2, but the vision was always to get this data into a relational database, so we can then analyze not just claims data, but clinical data to drive improvements in health for everyone and in the DHMSM program specifically for the active military.  So we are excited about partnering with the DHA customer on both user experience and to capture the data, to go after some of the root causes of a medical issues within our active military. And that was always the promise of the program. And now that we have a critical mass of information on the active military, the task now is to improve their health. And that will be through data and data analysis and using big data and AI tools. And we're really excited about the program.  As it rolls into this sort of second life, it may not be as large from a revenue standpoint, because we're not rolling two waves a quarter out to military treatment facilities. But I think the benefit to the active military will be even greater than it has been, as we've installed the electronic health care record system. Operator : Next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Peter Arment : Chris, on the EBITDA margin guidance, it just implies kind of a much stronger mix probably in the second half. Just maybe if you could call out maybe some of the puts and takes around that and the competence level around kind of that seeing that stronger performance? Chris Cage : Absolutely something we've been spending a lot of time on internally, making sure that there's a clear path to get there. Look, it's going to take some hard work. It's not the start that we hoped for. But fundamentally, it begins with getting the SES business back on track and the team has a concrete plan. They've implemented a number of action, there's been some reduction in force, there's been a lot of transition there to make sure that businesses, in and of itself, is a strength, not a weakness in the quarters ahead. I've mentioned Health. And again, we're very pleased with what we see there. And looking ahead to the next few quarters with PACT Act cases ramping up, the SSA program continuing to run strong, there's margin uplift that we see there.  The Defense business, quite honestly, they had year-over-year margin increase, but it's not where \u2013 it hasn't reached its full potential. And the team knows that. And so, from a mix perspective, we see some programs that are coming online or others that are ramping that will absolutely lift some margins across the board. And then, we're going to have to make sure that we run very efficiently on cost management for the rest of the year. We did that last year the back half and showed what we're capable of. So there's a number of things there that are already in flight.  And there is a little bit of seasonality in the portfolio too, Peter. There's definitely \u2013 as it relates to award fee timing, incentive fee timing, we've looked hard at when those things should come to pass and when they get recognized. So it'd be a combination of SES getting returned to the right level of profitability, strength in Health and some program mix in Defense and then some cost control actions. Roger Krone : Peter, I would add. As you know, our business model still has a significant dependency on our great people. And we had some goals for hiring and retention for the year. And we're very, very pleased that our voluntary attrition is significantly below what we had planned. And Leidos is still an attractive place for people to come to work. So our hiring has not slowed down.  We've actually eaten into, if you will, our open kind of wreck situation where we're in one of the best staffing positions that we have been in for years. Now, we may benefit from some of the hyperscalers reducing their staffing, but albeit we are very comfortable with where we are from a teammate standpoint. I think it's early, but the first quarter performance has really been outstanding. And if we can maintain that throughout the year, that will give us a lot of momentum as we close out 2023. Peter Arment : If I can just sneak one in. Roger, can you give us the latest update on the Cobham business, how that is going and just any thoughts there? Roger Krone : Peter, say that again? Peter Arment : The business you acquired in Australia, Cobham. Roger Krone : I was at the AVALON airshow earlier this year, which was down in Melbourne. It is at or better than our business case and doing really, really well. Peter, I'm an aeroplane guy. So this was like walking in, tall cotton for me. It was just a lot of fun.  And we have two contracts, one to do search and rescue, one to do a maritime patrol. Both of those are performing very, very well. They are, I'd say, 75% fully integrated into our Australian operation.  The only challenge that we have, which is a worldwide, I know that on this morning's radio that American Airlines' pilots \u2013 it's a challenge everywhere. And we wish we could hire more pilots. If we had more pilots, we could we could fly more hours. But Paul Chase in Australia and Roy Stevens who runs that group have really, really leaned forward on integrating that business into our unit in Australia. And we couldn't be more pleased.  And again, I was at AVALON earlier this year, and I got to sit in the airplane and talk to the pilots. I went to our training academy, talk to some of the students and it's a vertically integrated airborne operations. And really, we've got the full value stream. And so, yeah, like I said, it is everything that we thought it would be, and probably more so.  The other huge benefit for us is they are flying the same types of aircraft in Australia that we're flying here in the US. So our ability to build some cross linkages and some synergies between the business that Gerry Fasano has in our ASO organization, what Roy has in Australia has been really, really good. So, so far, so good. Actually maybe a little bit better than we expected. Operator : Our next questions are from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Matthew Akers : I want to ask about the orders environment. I guess your book-to-bill a little bit light in the quarter. Do you think that ends up kind of above 1 for the year? I know you mentioned some of the big pipeline there. And is there any risk around that with the debt ceiling? Have you seen any change in kind of customer behavior around some of those talks? Roger Krone : Of course, we want to grow. We've got a long term target out there. You can back out of our long term targets, then our book-to-bill has to be greater than 1. And where we sit today, we fully expect our book-to-bill to be greater than 1. But that means, and you all know this, is that we have to win some programs between now and the end of the year. There are some big programs yet to be awarded. We have done well in winning large programs. We don't win them all unfortunately. We never put a bid in that we don't expect to win, but it's a very, very competitive environment and we have to do better in second, third and fourth quarter that we've done.  I don't expect, even with the machinations around the debt ceiling and the budget, for the award process to slow down this year. I think it could get a little rocky in 2024 as we get into presidential politics, if we're in a full year CR, trying to get new starts started in 2024. If we don't get an omnibus, I'd like to think we do get an omnibus, but time will tell.  We're pretty active. As I said, we still have a lot of proposals to write this year, some of those might actually get awarded this year. We have a ton, well, I guess $30 billion, maybe more than a ton of awards that need to be adjudicated. And many, many of those are going to happen this year. So we're very optimistic about the future, our track record of winning big awards, and we don't talk a lot \u2013 actually, our track record of winning small awards is even better than our track record of winning big awards. And that has to do with our customer intimacy and our great program leadership working with our customers, and I feel really good.  Something we haven't talked a lot about what we call on contract growth, but our ability to expand our business base with the existing customers, that has always been very strong for us. So I'm optimistic. And Tom Bell, he's got a strong business development background. He's sold globally around the world. He has built a terrific business at Rolls Royce, and he's going to lead the business development effort here. And he'll probably do a much better job than I did of winning programs. So I'm really optimistic about the future. Matthew Akers : If I could do one more, maybe, Chris, can you give us any help with sort of the pacing of earnings for the year? Just kind of a lot of moving pieces with the impacts this quarter from supply chain and DHMSM maybe dipping at the end of the year? Is Q2 kind of flat and then a big ramp up in the second half? Or is it more kind of smooth or just any way we should think about that? Chris Cage : Matt, we usually don't give a lot of details quarter by quarter, but I would tell you that we'll build. Clearly, the SES turnaround, the actions that are taken and underway, they're not going to deliver its full potential overnight. So I would expect Q2 to be better, but Q3 and Q4 to be better still. And I think you should expect we'll be gaining a lot of steam into the summer. We'll get Tom fully on board as he'll have a point of view. And he'll want to be aggressive. I expect that fully to make sure we're delivering on our commitments as we all do. So my expectation is Q2 will definitely be better, but you'll see our full potential in the back half of the year. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bert Subin with Stifel. Bert Subin : Maybe just to sort of switch gears a little bit. Where do we stand across Dynetics? You noted the Wide Field of View award. But can you update us on how IFPC and the hypersonic glide body contracts or potential contracts progressing? Do you still expect that we'll see a material inflection in that part of the business next year? Roger Krone : Yeah. For those of you who are able to make the trip to Huntsville, you saw a lot of what our future is going to be in what we call platform or the systems integration business. And generally, everything's on track. IFPC Enduring is doing well. We expect some magicians in the hypersonic glide body business. We won a program called Mayhem in the hypersonic world, which is really going to be helpful.  If you made the trip to Huntsville, I don't want to repeat a lot of what we presented down there, but we talked about this year being one where we're in development and ramping and then 2024 is, if you will, kind of the payoff year where a lot of these programs are starting to hit production. And so, we see both the top line grow and the bottom line grow with it as we move out of development on a whole series of programs.  But we've got great people there. We continue to send people to Huntsville. By the way, Huntsville is one of those places in the US where technical people just want to go. They love the environment. It's a great outdoors city. There's a huge technology community there. And we've had many, many of our best and brightest self-select to go down and work at Dynetics. And that has helped us add depth to the team as we have ramped up the business there. Two things we haven't talked a lot about because I think they are at the kind of a high beta. We still have a human lander bid that is outstanding. We're one of two bidders on that program. And I think it will be a complicated award. But we're hopeful that we will realize something out of our human lander position.  And then, if you were at Space Symposium, and I know some of you were, we had a mockup of our lunar rover, and that will be more of a 2024 award. But we're pretty excited about our rover offering. We're actually teamed with NASCAR on our rover. And so there, there are some kind of shoot for the stars, literally, programs in the NASA world that could further enhance the portfolio at Dynetics. But so far, across the board, generally doing well, not to say we don't have a program or two that's ever going to have a development problem because when you're doing development, there are issues. But we're pretty much in line with what we showed you when you were down in Huntsville. Bert Subin : Maybe just a follow-up question within the Defense side. Last quarter, you highlighted that customers wanted to move a little faster on DES and you were just sort of balancing that against providing sort of the highest quality service you could. Can you update us on where transitions stand and whether your view of the ramp process of that contract has changed at all? Roger Krone : Our part is going well. So we've got the architecture in place and ONE-Net and what have you, and so now it's getting the next task orders. Within the DISA organization, we're in the middle of the transition of the DISA environment. So that's actually going well. But the strength of that program is when we start to do networks in the fourth estate outside of DISA, and that hasn't started to ramp yet. And we're working well with Lt. Gen. Skinner to make that happen. But it hasn't happened yet.  And would I like to see it ramp faster? You bet. I would like to see it ramp faster. But the best thing we can do is offer a faster, better, less expensive and more secure network to the support agencies within DoD and then help DISA sell those benefits. And that's our job on the program. We have, again, a great team, a great program manager, we have a great relationship with DISA. But we've got to some book some early transformations of networks and some of that work is still ahead of us Operator : Our next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with J.P. Morgan. Seth Seifman : Just wanted to ask about the Health business. And it sounds like maybe we should be expecting some margin expansion there in order to drive the rest of the year. And that'll be driven in part by the PACT Act. Can you talk a little bit about how those expectations have changed in terms of the number of exams there and how much of the mix will be coming out of that exam business and what that opportunity is looking like now over time? And are we looking at kind of high teens margins in that business the rest of the year? Roger Krone : Seth, I'll start and I'll let Chris add. We always like to talk about our portfolio. And if we have a situation like an SES where the first quarter is a little slow and we look at the full year, we're always looking at other parts of the portfolio that have the potential to outperform. And where we stand today, we're optimistic about both top line and bottom line in health.  PACT Act exams in general, our ability to hit our service level agreements and in the future earn incentives based upon performance. So we feel we feel good about that.  I talked at some length about the DHMSM program. The other two programs, what we call, military family life and counseling, and there were reserve health readiness programs are both doing extremely well. And RHRP, we're finally starting to do events with guards people and reservists which will drive top line. But I really want to give kind of hats off to the whole Health team. They have done just an outstanding job of executing on their program, staying close to the customer, providing a value added benefit. And when you do that, then good things happen in the group. And customers come back, they want to do more, they want to do expanded work.  And PACT Act is a positive influence in the future. But in the disability exam business, you get more than your fair share because you hit your service level agreements with both timeliness and quality of the exams that you do. And our organization at QTC has always been at the forefront of performing in the exam business. And it just gives us confidence and optimism that, overall, we may see some better performance in Health than we had initially thought. And as we look at our guidance in the balance of the portfolio, when we were behind in one business, we're always looking to where we think we will overachieve and Health is certainly that area this year. Chris Cage : Let me just add. So don't put us down for high teens as a long term new goal. But I think we've demonstrated we're doing what we said. We'll get it to mid-teens and you saw Q4 got into the 14.5% range. We improved it from there to Q1 and we see more improvement ahead of it.  Part of is what Roger talked about. The team has done an excellent job focused on quality. That will pay dividends, we believe, in the long term. Our throughput has been excellent. And the customer is seeing, with the PACT Act as a catalyst for more volume, that they needed to rethink how they did incentives and disincentives. And that created an opportunity for a contractor like Leidos that has confidence in our ability to maintain high throughput, great quality. There's an opportunity to continue to do better on the incentive side as we move forward.  So, again, that's going well. Our SSA program is going well. There's a lot of things that we're bullish about. And again, I see some upside on margins. But we're not committing to a new long term expectation at this point in time for that business. Seth Seifman : Maybe if I could follow up on that, Chris, just to put a little more fine point on it. If I annualize Q1, it's basically implying that that the Health earnings are going to be flat in 2023 versus 2022, which I think would be a pretty good result, given some of the margin headwinds there. Is that then a sustainable level of earnings going forward, given the maybe above trend margin that we're going to see in 2023 and some of the DHMSM headwinds? Is it a level off of which the business can grow? Because it's been executing quite well for the last couple years? Or is it a level that you kind of had to run real hard to get there in 2023, and so maybe that's a level that's above what's sustainable? Chris Cage : No, we don't look at it as taking all the air out of the balloon just to make 2023's numbers. I think we're conscious on all the bids that are going through. There's quality bids in that portfolio we have to continue to win.  The only upside on DHMSM, quite honestly, is it's a huge volume program, it's well run, well executed, we're happy with it, but it's not at the top end of the Health margins in the business. So as we look at some of the other programs we're bringing on board, we think we can offset that DHMSM profitability with a lower top line volume. And so, our expectation is we set plans for the team every year, and I don't want to get ahead of Tom, but we'll set a 2024 plan where the Health business should deliver a growth in earnings. Quite honestly, that's my expectation at this point in time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities. Tobey Sommer : I was hoping you could expand on and contextualize the retention perhaps by quantifying the improvement year-to-date, give us some context for the arc of retention trends in recent years and what, if any, financial implications there were in the quarter of maybe having more employees than you anticipated and what that could mean for the balance of the year in achieving your top line guidance? Chris Cage : First of all, I don't think we actually put out hard numbers. But let me give you a little bit more visibility. So there are some industry benchmarks that we all track. And pre-pandemic, we were always maybe a point better, okay? And then during early in the pandemic, everybody's retention went to single digits, mid-single digits, and then coming out of it, everybody went to the benchmark, historic benchmark, and actually significantly over it by 100 basis points, maybe more than that. And so, when we set the level and we put together a staffing plan that goes with our financial plan and our great HR team takes that as they plan their recruiting for the year, we had a number that was kind of halfway between the worst of the pandemic heights and the traditional benchmark. And we have been operating maybe 3% below that to give you just a sense. And if you take an employee base of 46,000 people and you are 3% better on voluntary turnover, then, Tobey, you can kind of run the numbers in your head what \u2013 you don't have to recruit just to stay even. By the way, there's huge benefits to retention and culture and learning. Just beyond a numbers game and being able to do the talent acquisition task, what it does for us from esprit de corps and learning and customer intimacy. So, it's a huge positive for us. And I know good things are going on throughout the industry. Frankly, we're focused on Leidos. And we just completed our all employee engagement survey where we literally go out to everyone who's a Leidos employee around the world and we are just really thrilled with the feedback that we get, the information that we receive, and we can parse it down to very, very small cohorts.  And, again, we are significantly over almost every benchmark that our survey provider provides us. And we spend a lot of time to try to make this a great place to work and to take care of our employees. We have this program, I referred to a little bit of my comments around Leidos Life, which is around their career development, flexibility and mobility in how we get the work done and then this new look at total health, where all of us grew up in sort of a comp and benefits world, and post-COVID, we realized that benefits really has to start with the whole self. You have to think about physical health, mental health, financial health, all of those things that come back together. And the implications, I think, for the long term \u2013 by the way, our direct labor base is probably a little bit higher than we had planned. That can be favorable to rates, but it's early. And we're only one quarter into it. And we may see some movement in the second half of the year that would be adverse.  But given all that we have experienced over the last two or three years, to be where we are today on the second of May, it just makes us feel really, really good about the human talent that we have in the organization. It's only going to provide positive aspects for the company and the positive aspects financially. Because if we can hire faster, we can ramp faster if we retain more people, it's going to pay off in top line and bottom line. Rob, it looks like we're over time. So I think we only have time for one more questioner. And then we'll wrap up. Operator : That last questions will be coming from the line of Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. Cai von Rumohr : Roger, I have to say you've done a terrific job. You've really transformed Leidos significantly from what it was when you joined the company. Cai von Rumohr : The one question I have looking at this year, the security products was light in the quarter and you mentioned some of the reasons. But with AEGIS just building presumably quite a bit below average margin and with having to pay higher prices, I think you've mentioned some inflation impact. It sounds like security products \u2013 excuse me, the totality of Civil is probably going to be a little bit lighter than it was, than you're expected going into the year. Is it reasonable to expect that the margins there might be sort of midway between the 9.2% of last year and the 10.2% of the year prior, and that, therefore, any goodness in Health is pretty much offset by a little tougher outlook in security? Roger Krone : I don't know why I thought the last question that I would have in my career would be an easy one. And I think we've covered everything that's going on in civil. Let's see. There is potential for Civil to be at the margin it was last year. But there's more risk, given the performance in the first quarter. And you I think you appropriately described the portfolio challenge that we have as a company. Jim Moos, who runs our Civil group, is all in on driving performance, both in the SES organization and the other parts of his portfolio. And he has tightened the belt, if you will. I think Chris mentioned that we have done some focused reductions in force. We have reconfigured the value stream in the SES business, bringing inside and into our control more of the production processes. We've got a very, very strong handle around our inventory, and how we distribute spares and what have you.  Part of what drives that business is the services side. And we've got to get the services side running like a fine Swiss watch. And Jim knows that. His team is fully committed to that. And I expect him to pick up margin significantly throughout the year, whether he actually gets all the way to where he was last year. We will talk about it or Tom will talk about it on a quarter by quarter basis. But the potential is there. We don't need for him by the way to be all the way where he was last year to still make our guidance. But it certainly would be helpful. Operator : Thank you, everyone. I'll turn the call back to Stuart Davis for closing remarks. Stuart Davis : Thank you, Rob, for your assistance on this morning's call and obviously thank you all for your time this morning and your interest in Leidos. We look forward to updating you again soon. Have a great day. Operator : This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the conference over to Stuart Davis, from Investor Relations. Sir, you may now begin. Stuart Davis : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our second quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Tom Bell, our CEO, and Chris Cage, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you'll also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll use during today's call. Turning to Slide 2 of the presentation. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, includes risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, as shown on Slide 3, during the call, we'll discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in today's press release and presentation slides. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom Bell, who will begin on Slide 4. Tom Bell : Thank you, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today leading Leidos into our exciting second decade. I'm also very happy to report that we closed a strong Q2. Driven by a healthy demand environment, we achieved revenue growth of 7% year-over-year, with strong organic growth across all segments. Margins, earnings, and cashflow rebounded from our first quarter, driven by, an improving business mix, a partial recovery in the security products business, and a series of fast-acting initiatives implemented across the business focused on costs and collections. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.9% was up 150 basis points from Q1, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.80 was up 22% sequentially. Also, operating cashflow of $164 million was up $262 million from last quarter. While putting this quality quarter on the books speaks to the underlying strength of the business, even more important to me, it reflects ability of the Leidos team to focus and deliver when expectations are clear. Now, as this is my first quarterly call with you, I thought I'd share some of my initial observations of Leidos. Over these first months, I've met with customers, employees, and analysts, and I've conducted detailed operating and strategic reviews with all our business groups and each of our functional organizations. The headline from this work so far is clear, our business foundations are impressive. I've come to think of these foundations in three distinct pillars. One, an incredible team, two, compelling technology creation, and three, the ability to act with pace while leveraging scale. These three elements in combination enable us to uniquely solve our customers\u2019 most vexing problems in differentiated ways. Let me unpack that a bit. First, we're a company of exceptionally talented and dedicated individuals. Their breadth and depth of expertise is remarkable, and they are palpably connected to our customers\u2019 missions. That translates into a truly differentiated culture with deep customer insights. Also, the esprit de corps and genuine care for each other at Leidos, creates an environment that embraces collaboration and entrepreneurship, critical to our continuing success. Our ability to effectively attract and motivate top talent is a distinct competitive advantage for us. And in this regard, Forbes recently named us as one of the best employers for diversity for new graduates and for veterans, and Ethisphere recognized us as one of the world's most ethical companies for the sixth consecutive year.  Second, technological innovation at Leidos is impressive, broad, and deep. The advances we are pursuing across Leidos are world-class. We leverage these key technology differentiators, what I refer to as golden bolts, across our entire portfolio. And we deploy these golden bolts in disciplines ranging from secure software to cybersecurity to signal processing, so as to bring extraordinary capabilities to our customers. A couple of recent examples of delivering complex mission capabilities to our customer includes, the successful hypersonic test launch under our MACH-TB program, and the last major deployment wave in the continental US of MHS Genesis, the Military Electronic Health Record System. This was done on time and on schedule, also significantly enhancing system capability. We've also been at the forefront of unlocking the power of artificial intelligence for our customers for decades. We've developed and deployed trusted AI to tackle some of our nation's most challenging missions. Our debut in applied AI was in 2004 when we built a self-driving vehicle as part of DARPA's Grand Challenge. By 2016, we launched the first unmanned autonomous ship. And now, we're deploying next-generation computer vision for automated passenger scanning in our ProVision 2 platform. Also, recently, we've deployed large language models in our Health group, designing a trusted AI solution where humans and AI work as partners to more rapidly align resources and improve our support to beneficiaries. Differentiated technology, including AI, created, unlocked, and responsibly controlled by our amazing people, is and will continue to be a unique attribute of Leidos. Now, to continue to accelerate our technical innovation, we are investing to broaden and deepen our workforce capabilities. So far this year, we've upskilled well over 3,000 of our people in fields ranging from AI to cyber, to software to digital engineering, and it's open to all our employees, not just our technical wizards, so that all can be conversant in our golden bolts.  The third pillar I've found here is equally important, scale and agility. Every customer I've met with is feeling the stress about the pace of change. Hard, vexing problems are coming at them at speeds they've never experienced, and they're looking for partners with speed and scale to address these holistic problems. They need us to operate with a clock speed that matches their urgency. At Leidos, we lean into this environment by challenging ourselves to operate with a strong bias for velocity. For example, within the US Space Force, the Space Development Agency is focused on rapid delivery of space-based capabilities to the joint war fighter. This is an ideal fit for Leidos, an essential, technically challenging mission where standard procurement cycles aren't acceptable. To that end, today, our satellite payload remains the only Tranche 0 tracking layer asset in space, and we're on track to launch Tranche 1 assets soon that will serve as the foundation for the defense of our nation from hypersonic missiles. All these findings have strengthened my conviction in the potential of Leidos. However, also in my first months, I've identified some areas where we must improve. First, some recent acquisitions have fallen short of plan. While I believe those acquisitions offer us significant strategic benefits, we will redouble our efforts to achieve the value envisioned in our acquisition business cases.  Second, all on this call recognize the fact that our financial performance has not always lived up to our investors' expectations. The team and I have had a series of candid conversations in this regard, and as a result, we have agreed that together when we make a commitment whether to each other, our customers or the Street, Leidos will meet that commitment. I call this simply a promises made, promises kept philosophy. Third, recent business development metrics have not been up to par. While we have a healthy backlog, currently $34 billion built over the last five years via a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3 times, we can and must do better. I believe that for a business like us, total backlog is a more relevant measure of future revenue growth than quarterly book-to-bill ratios. We will be determined to grow our total backlog over time with quality wins. As such, we'll be candid with ourselves about where we have a differentiated capability that the market recognizes and resource it appropriately. And where perhaps we find we do not enjoy true differentiation, we will ask ourselves some honest probing questions, courageously acting on their answers. Finally, I believe Leidos can benefit from a certain strategic sharpening. To propel this and to optimize our success going forward, we are now in the process of crafting a clear new north star for Leidos. As we crystallize this new north star, we will use it to guide all our strategic decisions, and over time, this will improve our win rates, drive margin enhancement, and better enable us to most successfully serve our customers\u2019 most important needs. While this north star is currently a work in progress, I can give you a few initial indications of where we'll be going. We'll take steps to simplify our organizational structure to promote operational excellence, allow for faster decision-making, and more tightly align our business across our key technology differentiators. We will focus more on the bottom line via greater cost discipline and by refining our investment strategy toward those areas of best opportunity, best overall value to the enterprise. And we'll be very thoughtful and disciplined on capital allocation, both internally and externally. In the near term, I will be laser focused on improving execution, so I don't expect much in the way of additional inorganic growth, but after we complete our next strategic plan and reach our targeted leverage ratio, select M&A will likely make sense for us again. At that time though, we'll be crisp in our approach to ensure there is a clear opportunity to create value for Leidos and our investors. Lastly, I believe that a regular and predictable program to return capital to shareholders drives better investment decisions across any enterprise, so be looking forward to that as well. As we progress this work, I'll look forward to updating you on how we plan to accelerate growth here at Leidos, especially on earnings and cash.  Now to our 2023 guidance. Based on our strong Q2 and our revenue momentum halfway through 2023, we are raising the top and bottom of our revenue guidance to a new range of $14.9 billion to $15.2 billion, an increase of $150 million at the midpoint. Revenue growth has been a key feature for Leidos in the recent past, and I'm pleased to acknowledge that this element of our business will continue to deliver for us. The delta in margin performance between the first 2Quarters of 2023 indicates to me variability in profit margin greater than that suggested by the prior 20 basis point guidance range Today, this is primarily due to the variability in our security products business. Now, the good news here is that the Civil team is aggressively knocking down these challenges by leaning out the cost structure and strengthening the supply chain. But considering the practicalities of a company becoming slightly more tied to product delivery timing, we are widening our adjusted EBITDA margin range guidance to 40 basis points. Therefore, our revised EBITDA range will be 10.1% to 10.5% for 2023. Lastly, we're reaffirming our non-GAAP diluted EPS range of $6.40 to $6.80, and we're reaffirming our operating cashflow target of at least $700 million. In closing, I'm optimistic about our future as we set course for Leidos\u2019 second decade of growth, and I look forward to meeting with you at upcoming conferences and roadshows. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris for more detail on our financial performance and updated outlook. Chris. Chris Cage : Thank you, Tom. Our second quarter financial results were indeed strong and put us on pace for a good year. Big picture, revenue continued its growth trajectory and we rebounded nicely on earnings. As I said on the last call, the Q1 profit shortfall was temporary, concentrated, and recoverable. We had improvement in the security products business, and we worked together as an enterprise to deliver solid results across the entire portfolio.  Turning to Slide 5, revenues for the quarter were $3.84 billion, up 7% compared to the prior year quarter. Revenue growth was broad-based, as each of our three reporting segments grew at least 5% organically. Onto earnings, adjusted EBITDA was $420 million for the second quarter, which was up 15% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.9% increased 70 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $252 million, and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.80. Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS were up 15% and 13%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. Earnings growth came despite a $6 million drag from net interest expense. Both share count and the effective tax rate were essentially unchanged from last year. Non-GAAP profitability was up from Q1 levels in all three segments, driven by improved business mix and program execution, as well as enhanced focus on indirect spending across the company. Though there were some pickups from achieving milestones and truing up completed programs that won't necessarily recur in future quarters, we saw improvement along most key profit drivers. Specifically, EAC performance was strong, with net write-ups of $18 million, and SG&A as a percent of revenue showed improvement as well. The year-over-year numbers paint a positive picture, but the sequential improvement is even more encouraging. Total revenues were up 4%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 150 basis points and non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 22%. Turning to the segment drivers on Slide 6, Defense Solutions revenues increased 7% year-over-year. The largest growth catalysts were in the areas of digital modernization, including Navy NGEN and hypersonics, especially SDA Wide Field of View Tranche 1, as well as our Australian Airborne Solutions business. For the quarter, Defense Solutions non-GAAP operating income margin increased to 9.3%, up 100 basis points from the prior year quarter, with maturing development programs, strong execution, and lower indirect spending. Health revenues increased 9% over the prior year quarter, driven by growth on the SSA IT work, and increased demand for medical examinations. For VB A, we're seeing higher volumes from the PACT Act, and we're earning a higher work share as a result of our performance. Also, the Reserve Health Readiness Program is now building. Non-GAAP operating income margin came in at 17% compared to 19.8% in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by the $28 million equitable adjustment in the second quarter of 2022 to cover costs incurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. More important, Health non-GAAP operating income margin was up 110 basis points, sequentially bolstered by increased volume, solid program execution, and a positive outlook on incentive fee performance.  Civil revenues increased 5% compared to the prior year quarter. The primary drivers of revenue growth were the NASA Aegis program, increased demand for engineering support to commercial energy companies, and a partial recovery within the security products portfolio. Civil non-GAAP operating income margin was 9.1% compared to 6.5% in the prior year quarter, which was unfavorably impacted by an adverse arbitration ruling in associated legal fees totaling $17 million. Sequentially, Civil non-GAAP margins improved by 270 basis points, which reflects partial improvement in the security products business. Consistent with expectations, the security products business is recovering but is not yet at peak levels. For perspective, year-to-date, the security products businesses actually up slightly year-over-year on revenue and down modestly on margin. As with last year, the back half of the year has the potential to be significantly stronger than the first half. We're seeing good traction in the business with the recent Leeds Airport award, and we've implemented the changes we talked about on the last call, including a leaner, more responsive cost structure and an improved supply chain. In addition, as part of the review of the business, we're looking at pruning the portfolio of products and geographies with lower returns. This work is ongoing. Taking a step back, we see security as an important and growing market, and we are positioning for success with our investment in the Charleston production facility, and looking to expand into new areas such as data center protection. Turning now to cashflow and the balance sheet on Slide 7, we generated $164 million of cashflow from operating activities, and $124 million of free cashflow. Net cash provided by operating activities benefited from strong collections and working capital management. DSO for the quarter was 59 days, a three-day improvement from the first quarter of 2023. We are in the middle of a cross-functional review of cash generation to include harmonizing vendor payment terms and building in more favorable collection terms on our contracts where possible. We continue to expect to drive sustainably improved performance over time. During the quarter, we paid the remaining $320 million of principal on the 364-day term loan agreement that came due in May, taking on $200 million of commercial paper to do so. These were the key movers of our $125 million net reduction in debt during the quarter. We expect to clear out the commercial paper during the third quarter, which will free up capital to deploy.  On to the forward outlook. Tom gave you the revised ranges. Let me provide a little more color. We expect revenue to remain near Q2 levels in the back half of the year, with some degradation from the (Focus Fox) loss, and a move to a single wave of deployments on DHMSM by Q4. We have a large pipeline of opportunities pending decisions, and we aren't dependent upon significant new business wins to sustain our current revenues. On EBITDA, the expanded guidance range primarily reflects the range of outcomes on the security products business, as well as the volume of special project work, on fixed price contracts, and incentive fee determinations. We've made our best assessment of the likely outcomes and are comfortable that our wider range conservatively incorporates the reasonable potential results. With a narrower range on revenue, and a wider range on margin, we're comfortable with our EPS range, which also tracks well to our cash target for the year. As in prior years, cash generation is concentrated in Q3. With a strong Q2, we are ahead of our internal plan year-to-date.  With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator so we can take some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from the line of Bert Subin, Stifel. Please proceed with your questions. Bert Subin : Hey, good morning and welcome, Tom. So, there was clearly a lot of concern coming out of 1Q earnings that weakness would persist in the securities product business. I mean, so far, that business seems to be recovering ahead of schedule. Can you just walk us through what changed in 2Q versus 1Q? What changes in the back half and whether you think SES can return to double-digit growth again next year? Tom Bell : Yes, thanks Bert. Well, first, before I turn it over to Chris to give some specificity on the latter part of your questions, let me say how proud I am of Jim and the team as they've been driving progress against that recovery plan. One of the first meetings I had with Jim was about the recovery plan and how we were going to get that ship righted. And as Chris said, the guidance that we've articulated incorporates the range of likely outcomes. The market is improving, as Chris suggested, with the Leeds award. We believe we have a superior product offering. We believe the customer continues to show confidence in our solutions, and the team is out there aggressively prosecuting the market. So, we feel very good about the fundamentals internally and the market externally. And also, the team is very focused on expanding the market that we serve with less traditional security solutions that are needed by a different set of customer sets. Chris, anything you'd like to add? Chris Cage : Yes. Well, I mean, Bert, obviously, there were a number of areas we were focused on driving improvements into, and the team has made great progress in that regard. I would tell you that we're not to the end game yet. Let me hit on a couple of areas. I mean, the customer-driven delays, that improved during the second quarter. We\u2019re not back to the original plan, but we see a path. Again, that was one of the reasons why we put the guidance forward that we did today. In sourcing, you saw the announcement on Charleston. We're excited about that. The team went through a very thorough evaluation of alternatives, and we're full speed ahead to get that operational. We think it's a relatively modest investment with a longer-term payback. And then there were a lot of cost reduction actions that were taken. Those are never easy. As part of that, one of the things that we did do is revector a senior resource to focus on strategic supplier obsolescence parts management. We're seeing improvements in that regard, helping our supply chain in that relationship. So, pipeline remains strong. As we indicated, looking at areas outside of the conventional airport and ports and borders, and we'll be selective on how we prosecute those bids for maximum benefit to the bottom line and cashflow going forward. Bert Subin : Great. That's super helpful. Thanks. And just as a follow-up, Tom, so Leidos has been talking about a Dynetics inflection being on the horizon for a little while now, and previously the expectation was organic growth was going to ramp pretty materially in 2024 for that business. As you've come into Leidos over the last three months and got a greater assessment of sort of where things are going, can you just walk us through how you're thinking about Dynetics and what you see as the growth path there. Tom Bell : Sure, Bert. Well, my first trip as CEO was to Huntsville to visit with the Dynetics team down there, and I was just thrilled to see what we have there in Alabama. Great facilities, great people, and really importantly, great customer connectivity. Steve and the team down there are bringing focus to what defines them. They're always going to be a place, I hope, that the customers believe they can get stuff done cleverly and fast. I think that's a real dynamic for Dynetics. And at the same time, Steve and the team are refocusing their attention on three primary areas. They're really focused on differentiating themselves in the markets of small satellite payloads. So, the success I referred to with Tranche 0 and Tranche 1, tracking layer assets. That's them being focused on small satellite payloads. Hypersonics, the MACH-TB launch that I mentioned is one of our hypersonics pursuits. So, we think that's a key area where we can be differentiated in the market. And last, but not least, force protection and making sure that as our forces are out there, we have products and services that protect our forces when they're deployed. So, those are the three areas that we're focusing on while we maintain the agility and entrepreneurship that has always defined Dynetics. And with that, I'll kick it to Chris to see if he has any more color to add. Chris Cage : Bert, the only thing I'd add there is, I mean, Tom's right, our agility and expertise gets us in the door. Our frontend Leidos Innovation Center, we call it LInC, with some of the brightest minds in some of these areas in the world, have us access to the most important customer sets. So, we have to perform. That gets us in the door. The team has to perform and deliver, and that's what I'm most encouraged by seeing progress that they're making on having improved discipline on bidding and execution, improved supply chain management, all those things that are critical as we ramp some of these programs up towards low-rate production and full-rate production. Bert Subin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your questions. Peter Arment : Yes, thanks. Good morning, Tom, and Chris. Hey, Tom, just to follow up on just kind of the products business in general. You kind of made some opening remarks on kind of improving the execution there. Just the variability in margins now because of the timing on product deliveries, just what's your view on just in general Leidos being in the products business? And do you expect to do more of this once you've kind of, I think you kind of said integrate and kind of improve the execution? Just your overall view on the product side? Tom Bell : Yes. Thanks for that, Peter. Yes, so I think having some diversity in our portfolio really makes sense for Leidos. I mean, after all, we're a $15 billion company, and in order to have countercyclical capabilities, you have to have some exposure, both to services and products. So, I like the fact that we're in a products business also. And I also like that there is connective tissue in everything we currently do that is poised in that thing I talk a lot about around how we solve our customers\u2019 most vexing emerging problems. So, whether it be products or services or software, it's really focused on how we lean into our customers\u2019 biggest challenge. I'm coming to understand our specific products and how they mix in with our services business models and how that makes sense. And at the core, whether it be a product or a service, remember that everything we do these days is at its core, IT services and algorithms and software and cyber, something that we are absolutely world class in. So, I like the mix and I think we'll be continuing the mix, and at the same time, we'll be very purposeful in how we exploit our advantages in each of those sides of the business. Peter Arment : Appreciate that. And then just, Chris, just quickly on the new EBITDA margin range, just puts and takes of what would make the difference between coming in and staying at the lower end or at the higher end? Is it all just tied to this aviation product deliveries? Are there any other factors that you would call out? Chris Cage : Yes, thanks, Peter. I mean, first of all, obviously the team here wants to deliver against the original commitment, but the wider range was prudent, given where we are and the volatility you'd seen in the first half of the year. But I\u2019m very encouraged about the second half and very optimistic about how we'll progress from here. I would point to a couple of things. Security products is an element of that, and as I said in my prepared remarks, we have the potential to have a significantly stronger second half there. We've laid a lot of good groundwork to realize that. Not everything is within our control. On top of that, there are a couple other things. In Health, we had a great quarter in Health and the team has done an excellent job, and there is the opportunity to sustain that momentum as we move forward. But some of that is dependent upon not only our performance, but throughput and customer satisfaction, some variables on incentives that, again, we'll monitor closely, and our past performance suggests that those are fully attainable. So that's another variable that we wanted to give ourselves some capacity for because that incentive calculations is somewhat new. And then lastly, just some of our digital monetization programs continue to ramp up and we're very pleased with the performance the team has executed against there. And there are some opportunities for more project work in the back half of the year. And depending upon how and when that comes to pass, could push us towards the higher end of that range. Peter Arment : Appreciate it. Thanks, Chris. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. Matt Akers : Yes. Hey, guys, good morning, and welcome to Tom. I wanted to ask about defense margins, kind of the strongest margins here we've seen in a little bit. Could you just talk about sort of how sustainable that is as we get into the back half and into 2024? Chris Cage : Hey, thanks, Matt. Yes, obviously, we're super pleased with the performance there. 9.3% OI margin, the highest in five years, and a lot of that's led by progress we've seen on some of our big digital monetization programs. And the team's done an excellent job there with NGEN, and DES is continuing to ramp, and there are others. And there are some other things going on that are sustainable outside of that, maturing development programs. Tom talked about Wide Field of View, especially Tranche 1, incorporating the lessons learned from Tranche 0, better mix overall with the Australian airborne aviation business that we acquired last year. That's helping us. And then there are some variable items, and I wouldn't say these are totally one-off, but we need to continue to perform well to realize these in the future. Award fee scores were very strong. We reached certain program milestones, and we did close out some old older projects. So, we won't deliver 9.3 every quarter near term, but that's the expectation we're setting for ourselves and the team longer term. And so, one thing that we will not take our eye off the ball on is an underpinning focus on indirect cost management and program execution. So, yes, great progress in the Defense Solutions segment and we're optimistic that there's more of that ahead of us. Matt Akers : Okay, thanks. And then I wanted to ask about DES. We haven't talked a lot about it, just how you're thinking about the timing, and does that ramp up here as we get into 2024? Chris Cage : Yes, it's a great question. Very timely. In fact, we had a review internally with the team yesterday, and we've got a really strong team on DES and working hand in glove with the customer. This year, it's still a modest contributor to the company in the order of $50 million of revenue, but we just walked through a number of active task orders that are either in evaluation by the customer, or some other ones that were coming up for bid and evaluation later this year. So, we're seeing the activity level increase and there's a roadmap on migrations of more users under the DoD net. So, again, continue to think of that as something that will be a much more significant contributor in 2024 and 2025 really beyond that. And we'll have more to say as we get later in the year and have some clarity on when those get determined. Matt Akers : Great. Okay, thanks. Operator : The next questions are from the line of Jason Gursky with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Jason Gursky : Yes, good morning. Tom, I was wondering if we might double-click for a minute on the comment that you made about leveraging acquisitions, maybe to better understand from your perspective kind of what went wrong, whether it was misalignment with expectations or execution, and what do you think it's going to take to fix what you've already acquired and what's going to change as you evaluate new acquisitions? Tom Bell : Yes, thanks for that. I wasn't here, so I can't say exactly what went \u201cwrong.\u201d I don't know that anything went wrong per se. I'm just looking at the current annual operating plan and the five-year plans for business against the original business case that was put forward to the board to approve the deals. And there's a certain gap. Now, I've been in this industry 40 years. I've frankly never seen an acquisition business case that doesn't have a gap. So, that's not new. That's not novel to Leidos, and that doesn't say that we've made mistakes in the past. That just means we've got the ball now and it's our job to make sure we leverage the investments we've made and the capital we've deployed to ensure that the real cores of the acquisition business case come to pass. That's with focus. That's with resolve. That's obviously by getting deep dives into program executions, and also making sure that we go back to the basics of the original business case and say, what is the golden bolt that we were trying to buy, and how do we make sure we deploy it across the enterprise as effectively as possible? So, that's what I'm focused on playing forward from here. As I suggested in my comments, I think the acquisitions that have been accomplished over the past 7, 8, 9 years here at Leidos, all make sense to me. Now, the key is just doubling down and making sure we make them make sense for our bottom line. Chris? Chris Cage : Yes. I mean, the one thing I'd add the playing off of Tom's words, the golden bolt example, I think our 1901 acquisition is a great example of that, right? And you don't hear us talking much about that because it's embedded into the organization and providing capability broadly against a number of our digital monetization contracts cutting across multiple sectors. That's the kind of leverage we want to see gained as we move forward with acquisitions. Dynetics, we talked about the Wide Field of View programs. And quite honestly, that is a combination of a legacy capability that Leidos brought to bear out of our Leidos Innovation Center. Dynetics is now in the midst of executing that program and building the payloads. That is the leverage we want to see going forward. So, we need to move more rapidly to link those capabilities together to get the full leverage out of future acquisition. Tom Bell : And on the subject of future acquisitions, you asked about what's going to be the drive going forward? As I suggested in my prepared remarks, obviously I think having a regular return of capital to investors makes sense to us. So, we're really focused on executing the work that we have on our plate now before we get back into the market to do M&A. However, when we do, in keeping with the north star that I referenced and a very clear articulation of where we want Leidos to be in 2030 - in 2028 and 2033, which are the two vistas we're setting out for ourselves, we'll have very clear articulations of, what are the technologies that we see emerging, what's the hypothesis of what the customer problems are going to be in the next five, 10 years, how might we either build those capabilities organically or acquire those capabilities inorganically. But all of those will be tempered with a very clear articulation of affordability, hurdle rates, and a very clear strategic narrative. So, premature to actually talk about what those are because we're still working out the north star and the vision of what our customers are going to need us to be, to serve them into the future. But those are the kind of things we'll be talking about. Jason Gursky : Okay, great. And then as a quick follow-up here, your comments on backlog growth and kind of maybe not necessarily being where you'd like it to be at this point, can you talk a little bit about whether that is a market issue overall and kind of the dynamics going on with your bid and proposal activity and whether we're seeing either a slowing or acceleration? And then just kind of what you might want to change internally if it's not a market issue. Tom Bell : Yes. So, the good news is, I don't think there's a negative market dynamic we're dealing with here. There's positive demand across all of our customers and there's great opportunity for organic growth. As I suggested, we have a strong backlog. We have a strong pipeline, and I think the number is something like $26 billion in pending awards. So, the timing of those awards is unfortunate in that the first half of the year has been light. But again, as I referred to in my comments, I think quarterly book-to-bill ratios can become quite a distraction and are actually quite unhelpful. What I'm focused on is building a quality backlog over time with quality wins that speak to long-term growth for Leidos. And I don't think the BD process here is broken. I know we know how to win. I'm passionate about winning. The whole ELT is passionate about winning and I would not count us out just yet. Chris? Chris Cage : Yes, Jason, I would - Tom said his remarks that we need to be better. So, that does imply there were some things where we swung and missed on some opportunities, and we would've liked to have won those, but be rest assured the team dissects those backwards and forwards anytime we have a loss, right? And there's always lessons learned moving forward, and we're not going to win them all. So, there's that combination, coupled with there are some things that are out there pending, and we're optimistic that those decisions will come here in the second half of the year. Plus, the pipeline is strong, $135 billion. We expect to put another $20 billion of proposals through the back half of this year. So, very active, and again, our track record over the long haul has been strong. So, this is - there's not a fundamental breakdown in our process. We've got great people in our business development organization, but we do need to land some of these ones that we have out there for decision right now. Jason Gursky : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : The next questions are from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Good morning, Tom, and Stuart. So, Tom, first one for you, please, and I appreciate your comments in the opening remarks about margin enhancements. What are some of the steps on organizational structure and bottom-line financial discipline you plan to take? Because I was just under the impression that Leidos has pretty good margins, it just could be variable at times. So, where do you see the potential opportunities on the profit margin side outside of the security business? Tom Bell : I think there is - thanks for the question, Sheila. I think there is a slight reset in the culture that I've enjoyed putting out there, which is treating Leidos\u2019 money as if it's our own. And as a result, Chris and I both talked about indirect spend and just tightening our belts a little bit and being a little bit more prudent with some of the indirect spend that is in any big bureaucratic organization. The reorganization I refer to is a tuning exercise. It's not a fundamental reset of Leidos. But I do think it will add to the bottom-line because as Leidos has grown dramatically over the last five years, we've bolted on and fit in some of those acquisitions such that there is replication and duplication of capabilities in different parts of our current value stream. And I think there is opportunity for us to bring those capabilities together, better bottle repeatability for customer solutions in some of those businesses, simplify the organization, promote better operational excellence around delivery for customer expectations, certainly speed up decision-making. And again, very key, align the organization around the key technology differentiators that set Leidos apart and define who we are in the markets that we serve. So, again, this isn't fundamental reset. It's a tuning exercise to take advantage of the inorganic plays that have been made, rationalize the organization toward those goals, and then incentivize teams to actually deliver against very crisp goals for those businesses. Chris, anything to add? Chris Cage : Yes, no, Sheila, I would echo that. I mean, clearly the primary objective here isn't to organize to drive costs out of the business. That'll be a second order variable. And we always try to run lean, so that'll create some opportunity to reinvest. We're hopeful, but back to your question, where are the margin opportunities? Obviously, super pleased with Health moving up a bit from what we had set as an expectation. You see what's possible within the Defense Solutions segment of the business. I think some of that will come down to selectivity. The teams will be more focused on which opportunities they have the ability to earn a quality return on. And so, we\u2019re very optimistic that that'll pay dividends as we move into 2024 and beyond. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Great. And then Chris, one more specific one on Health. Yes, I thought the merchants were very good at 17%. I think you mentioned a new incentive calculation on the VBA work. Can you provide additional detail around how we might think about that opportunity going forward, and how do we think about the wind-down on the single wave at DHMSM impacting profitability in the second half? Chris Cage : Yes, thanks, Sheila. So, on the incentive side, again, this was a change that went into effect earlier this year. So, we're working through it and we'll have more to say as we learn more. But I would tell you that the incentive structure at the VBA was optimized from their point of view for all participants in order to better serve the veterans and to deliver better outcomes for VBA. And it gives contractors like Leidos the opportunity to invest, to drive quality outcomes, better throughput, better patient experience, and be recognized and compensated potentially for those outcomes. So, that's just getting started and that creates an opportunity where we're a bit more optimistic that if we perform the way we have in the past, and you have to earn it every quarter that the mid-teens margin has some upside to it that we previously communicated. And we'll just have to see how that goes. Obviously, the caseload volume from the PACT Act is still settling in. And the other thing that's settling in is us earning more than our fair share, if you will, of the work share, because our performance has been so strong. So, some of those variables will impact that as well. But we're optimistic that that should create some sustainable upside. And then on DHMSM, obviously this is a little bit of a headwind on the growth side, and we'll see a bit of a moderation in Q4 and more so in 2024. But from a margin perspective, I mean, it's a quality program, well run, but it is not one of the highest margin programs within the Health portfolio. So, I don't think that's a negative as it relates to Health margin. And the team is working hard and has a number of high-profile opportunities that they're pursuing right now that'll help offset the revenue piece as we move forward. And we talked about RHRP as another example of a program ramping that'll help offset that a little bit too. So, a few dynamics going on there, but don't look at DHMSM as a margin headwind for us. Tom Bell : Yes, and just not to let that go without my commentary too. I just want to say that we couldn't be more proud of Liz and the team there in Health because they are earning great margins because they have a differentiated offering that is serving our veterans and our customer in a differentiated way. So, it's really a joy to see that ecosystem come together. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with J.P. Morgan. Pleased to proceed with your questions. Seth Seifman : Hey, thanks very much. Good morning and welcome, Tom. I just wanted to follow up. I think there was an earlier question asking about Dynetics and the inflection that was expected there next year. I wonder, maybe zooming out to the whole business, there are some standing three-year targets out there in terms of organic growth that would point to some acceleration in 2024. I guess, Tom, in the spirit of promises made, promises kept, should we should we still consider those targets to be operative? Tom Bell : Yes. Well, I'll start and let Chris fill in some blanks. I certainly am very aware of the Investor Day we held a couple of years back and the view toward 2024 that we gave at the time. I've started staring at 2024 lightly, but in all brutal honesty, Seth, I'm very focused on finishing 2023 strong and laying a strong foundation for Leidos over the next 3, 5, 10 years. So, I actually haven't done my own diagnostics of how achievable the 2024 targets are. But obviously, if we do hit the objectives in 2023, we're a step closer to achieving those objectives that we laid out in that industry day a couple of years ago. Chris, you want to? Chris Cage : Yes. Seth, the only thing I'd add, obviously, Tom coming on board, we've got to get him even more deep into our detailed plans as we look ahead to 2024. And one of the things that is a change condition is ensuring that we are optimizing for the best bottom line in cash performance and the selectivity that'll come with that. So, really being thoughtful around how our resources get allocated to pursue opportunities in technical investment and differentiation as we pivot into 2024. And some of those things will have near term paybacks and some of those things will have longer term paybacks. So, more to say on 2024 as we progress through the year, but everybody's heads down on delivering this year as strong as we can and putting some wins on the board and positioning for the future. Seth Seifman : Great. Thanks. I'll stick to one this morning. Operator : Our next questions are from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Robert Spingarn : Hey, good morning. Just following on that - hey, good morning, everybody, and welcome, Tom. On 2024, just with regard to the budget and the difference between the budget caps from the debt ceiling deal on the defense budget, and then on non-defense where there's going to be decreases, given that you have a couple of segments that point away from defense. Do you just broaden the aperture there so that your pipeline can offset potential pressure on the budget? Tom Bell : Yes, you're right, there is a curious dynamic that's been set up as a result of the debt ceiling debate and resolution that occurred, that obviously people on Capitol Hill are expressing optimism that they will solve before we're facing another government shutdown. At the same time, we're actively working with all of our customers on both sides of that equilibrium, if you will, to ensure that if there are things we can do this year to get them out of harm's way of any possible budget challenges they might face next year, we're engaged with them on that. And we're also focusing on exactly what you suggest, Robert, which is expanding the areas where we can help those customers and/or customers like them. So, I\u2019m not overly concerned about 2024 and the law of unintended consequences, if you will. I'm very focused on the fact that the team is engaged with customers about all those eventualities, and we feel we're fairly insulated against near-term impacts from any possible government shutdown. Chris? Chris Cage : Yes, Rob, I mean, there's certainly areas within our Civil and Health business that we've been positioning to make sure we're in priority areas for our customers. We just talked a bit about the VBA side and that's not going to change. But outside of the civilian agencies, I mean, you look at what we do in our commercial energy business, and grid resiliency and critical infrastructure, and those are areas that you're going to see more spending dedicated to. So, the team's really been doing an excellent job there. And obviously, we've been talking a lot about security products in the pipeline and opportunities there. So, there are definitely parts of the portfolio that we will have strong budgetary environments, we believe, and we'll prioritize those in the near-term. And as Tom mentioned, we're optimistic that we'll weather any challenges in certain customer areas. Robert Spingarn : Chris, just on that last part, when we think about healthcare and discretionary versus non-discretionary funding, so Medicare, Medicaid and so on. Is there a way to quantify what portion of your healthcare business gets funded out of those non-discretionary budgets? Chris Cage : Well, a lot of the stuff that we're doing on the medical examination businesses is in that bucket, right? So, we know that's well protected and insulated. And then, obviously the health record modernization programs are priorities for our customer sets and what we're doing on Reserve Health Readiness. So, I think by and large, Rob, we\u2019re in a good position there, but that'll be something we can come back with details on in the future. Robert Spingarn : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question is from the line of Toby Sommer with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Jasper Bibb : Hey, good morning. This is Jasper Bibb on for Toby. Just wanted to ask about the security products business and underperformance versus the acquisition case there. Would there be any way to quantify what getting that business back up to your targets might mean for Civil segment revenue growth and margins over the next few years? Chris Cage : Yes, Josh, I think it's a little premature. Obviously, we all know that with the COVID pandemic and worldwide aviation travel not where we thought it would be, that we're quite a bit under on the topline where that business was expected to be, but the growth rates over the last couple of years have been improved, and we're optimistic as we look ahead we'll continue to see that. So, when you look at Civil, I mean, what we're focused on is raising the floor of performance. Q1 was below our standards. Q2 much improved. Over time, we expect the Civil business to be on average a 10% plus margin business. And in the best quarters we'll see it 11% and above. And if we raise the floor of performance, which we're focused on in security products, that'll allow us to do that and achieve significant upside, hopefully over time. So, again, I think that just gives you a sense that there is room for that to grow going forward, and our job is to take out the variability that you've seen more recently Tom Bell : And on the top line and bottom-line expansion of our security business, as I have said, security is a vexing problem that's not going away. And in fact, more and more Civil customers, don't think government, civilian customers, are thinking about the security of their premises and the need for them to be more guarded on what goes in and what comes out. This is a great opportunity for market expansion for the team at very good margins. So, I like our bet on security, and I think it's going to be a good place for us to be as we prosecute the next five years. Jasper Bibb : Thanks for that. I\u2019ll stick to just one question today so we can get some more people going. Stuart Davis : Thanks, Josh. Hey, Rob, it looks like we're coming pretty close to the top of the hour, so I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Sure. That question will come from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Noah Poponak : Hi, good morning, everyone. Chris, last quarter with security products, you provided a lot of detail on where the challenges were. You talked about customer schedule delays where they couldn't accept product, supply chain disruption, and then you said there were service agreement penalties and product investments. I was wondering if you could just quickly update each of those. I mean, how many customers are delayed and how many are on schedule? And then I guess those other three, are they just kind of fully behind you or not? Chris Cage : Yes. Hey, thanks, Noah. And I hit on this a little bit earlier on one of the questions, but just to reiterate, on the customer, it's predominantly a large program with a single customer that we've been - it's a multi-year arrangement to deliver a number of products. We are still not on the original schedule that we had laid out with them, and the team is working hard to get units accepted and progress was made in the second quarter. That will continue to be something we'll work through the third quarter and the fourth quarter this year. And again, with the guidance range we gave you, we're comfortable that if we're not able to get all the way back, we're still solidly in our range. So, that is ongoing, improving, but, but not resolved. The supply chain side of things, several things are going on there. Number one, setting up our capability to perform light manufacturing in the future. That commitment was made. We're full speed ahead on outfitting that Charleston facility, and we'll be well positioned beginning in 2024. In the meantime, we have improved our ability to get the component parts that we need. We've insourced certain circuit board repairs. We've seen OEMs step up with better response times. And as I mentioned, we've positioned one of our senior leaders in that organization to focus on critical supplier management and part obsolescence. So, again, that's shown improvements, which is not fully resolved, but significantly improved the service level penalty situation. I would say the R&D investments are on track. The team has laid out a plan. We're not compromising there. Ensuring that we have the full capability of our software with our hardware is critical as a differentiator for us. And so, we like where that is trending. And then we took out a lot of additional costs in the business to set ourselves up for more streamlined performance going forward. And I think that'll actually yield better communication flow, clear roles and responsibilities. And so, that'll - as we optimize that with the team that we have in place going forward, we think we'll see some continued improvements in our performance. So, solid progress. Not done, Noah, I think is the punchline, and that is an area that gets full visibility from Jim Moos, our Civil leader, and the whole security detection team, they're all over it. Noah Poponak : Okay. I guess it's a pretty good step-up in the quarter sequentially, despite not being to the finish line on all of that. And I appreciate the widening of the margin range and the volatility that's inherent in what we're talking about here, but the guidance implies the margin is a decent amount lower in the back half, yet you're describing getting to the finish line on these Civil items. So, does the low end just incorporate the unlikely but can't rule it out risk that that customer delay takes a big step backwards? Or is there something outside of the tail that could get you to the low end of that margin range? Tom Bell : I\u2019ll take that, if you don't mind, Noah. If I could characterize the widening of the range, that is in my mind more applicable for a business like ours that does products and services and is subject to the timing thereof. And so, I just think a 40-basis points guidance range is going to be the new normal going forward, but don't read into the 10.1 acquiescence or fatalism that that is the goal. It is certainly not the goal. The team is driving toward the high end, as you would expect the team to do. However, it is consistent with our promises made, promises kept philosophy where I don't want to put out a range that is - that later I'm not going to be able to hit. So, 10.1 to 10.5 is an adequate and realistic view of the entire range of possibilities we can see at this time, and we'll keep driving for the upper end of that range. Noah Poponak : I understand. And if I might just quickly, Tom, appreciate all the color you've given here, and there's a lot of things you're talking about working on. You've had these questions on the financials of the business beyond 2023 and the prior Investor Day-oriented midterm, long-term outlook. How are you thinking about eventually having another Investor Day providing a fresh set of midterm financial goals versus not doing that and just running the business and letting the results speak for themselves? Tom Bell : The team is already talking to me about when we would have the next Investor Day. So, in my mind, it's a question of when, not if. Noah Poponak : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Stuart Davis for any closing remarks. Stuart Davis : Thank you, Rob, for your assistance on the call this morning. And thank you all for your time this morning and your interest in Leidos. We look forward to updating you again soon. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the conference over to Stuart Davis, from Investor Relations. Stuart, you may now begin. Stuart Davis : Thank you, Shamali, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our third quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Tom Bell, our CEO, and Chris Cage, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you'll also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll use during today's call. Turning to Slide 2 of the presentation, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, includes risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, as shown on Slide 3, during the call, we'll discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in today's press release and presentation slides. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom Bell, who will begin on Slide 4. Tom Bell : Thank you, Stuart, and good morning everyone. It's really good to be with you today. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter for Leidos this morning, a quarter of record revenue, earnings, cash flow, bookings, and backlog. Revenue grew 9% year-over-year this quarter, our fastest (indiscernible) two years, and well ahead of the pace implied in our guidance. Customer demand remained robust across all three of our segments, and we are proud of the work that we accomplished with our customers to deliver on important missions. Non-GAAP EPS was up 28% year-over-year, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.5%. Cash management and collections were even stronger. Operating cash flow of $795 million was already in excess of our existing full year guidance of at least $700 million. As a result of this quarter's strong performance and the momentum established in our second quarter, we are raising our 2023 financial guidance across all measures. This quarter's results and our improved outlook were driven by the substantial progress the team has made delivering on our performance initiatives articulated during our last call. First, instituting a promises made, promises kept culture here at Leidos. Second, analyzing and improving acquisition performance. Third, enhancing business development performance and backlog quality. And fourth, sharpening Leidos\u2019 strategy. Let me speak to each of these initiatives in turn. First, we're executing well on creating a promises made, promises kept culture here at Leidos, challenging ourselves to consistently deliver on the expectations we set for ourselves, and ensuring that we're having candid conversations about what is working and what can be improved. We're taking decisive actions to reallocate resources and course correct when needed. The team understands that creating this culture is not a one and done or twice as nice event, but rather a quarter-by-quarter disciplined drumbeat. Second, we're taking definitive actions to enhance performance, drive predictability, and de-risk our Dynetics and security products or SES businesses. In Dynetics, we're in the final stages of business integration across all financial contracts, supply chain, manufacturing, and HR systems. This will result in full proactive management visibility into the business, better business efficiency, and a better employee experience. We've added significant engineering and program management expertise to Dynetics to better serve our customers throughout critical programs of record. The growth outlook for Dynetics is strong in the three priority areas I identified in our last quarter. In hypersonics, we're ramping up production rates, while looking to improve effectiveness and lower costs. In small satellite payloads, we have all four Wide Field of View tracking layer Tranche 0 payloads in orbit. Moreover, we're executing on Tranche 1, and recently submitted and recently submitted our proposal for Tranche 2. In force protection, we're tracking toward government-level development testing of IFPC Enduring Shield in early 2024, and we're making progress on the persistent surveillance needs of the Army and Marine Corps. In SES, we saw improvement in the quarter on revenue and margin, coupled with strong bookings. We bolstered our supply chain resiliency and took costs out of the business to create more predictability. At the same time, consistent with the promises laid out last quarter, the team has critically evaluated the business to identify unprofitable product lines and unfavorable geographies, and we've updated our sales projections to better reflect current customer buying behavior. Based on these candid evaluations and proactive measures to right-size the business, we are taking a non-cash pre-tax charge of $688 million. As previously disclosed, the market has changed since the SD&A acquisition and won't return to pre-pandemic levels as fast as previously expected. As a proof point, the TSA administrator testified to Congress recently that the rollout of CT at the checkpoint would not be completed until 2042 at current funding levels. Broadly, customers are delaying recapitalization decisions and holding onto existing machines longer. With this as a backdrop, the team has moved to right-size the business, discontinue sales of an unprofitable product line, and exit numerous higher-risk, lower-return geographies. We remain committed to the overall security products market where we offer differentiated technology-driven solutions. Security concerns will be just as, if not more pervasive going forward, providing a long-term growth opportunity for Leidos. This includes the regulated aviation and ports and border markets, as well as commercial infrastructure security and loss prevention markets. The definitive actions we have now taken will better position our security business to grow from here in both margins and earnings. We also made progress on our third initiative, delivering exceptional business development performance in the third quarter. $7.9 billion in awards is a new quarterly high watermark for Leidos. Our book-to-bill ratio in the quarter of 2.0 brings our year-to-date and trailing 12-month ratios to 1.2. But more important to me, our $38 billion of backlog is now $4 billion larger than last quarter\u2019s, and supports our growth and margin objectives. This is what I was referring to last quarter when I mentioned growing our total backlog over time with quality wins. Let me touch on a few of those quality wins this quarter, which demonstrate the ways Leidos provides differentiated solutions to meet customer (indiscernible). The largest win was the Army Common Hardware Systems\u2019 sixth generation, known as CHS-6, which is a single-award IDIQ with a potential value of $7.9 billion over 10 years. Through technology, we'll be streamlining and optimizing complex supply chains and transforming logistics to be resilient to supply chain disruptions and cyber risks. Because we offered the army a truly differentiated solution, this award was not protested, and task orders are already beginning to flow. Please note, because of the nature of IDIQ contracts, CHS-6 did not material - did not contribute to our record Q3 bookings and backlog that I mentioned earlier. We also had two large Recompete awards in our Intelligence Group that secure our portfolio for years to come. On a $900 million contract to support and enhance Department of Homeland\u2019s security networks, we'll enable cross-agency intelligence sharing and secure collaboration, while delivering capabilities like quantum resistant cryptography, AI operations, robotic process automation, and classified cloud service integration. On a $700 million contract to provide prototype and technology development support to a longtime customer, we'll identify emerging technologies and develop new tools, techniques, and cyber capabilities to enhance their mission.  My final callout is a $125 million contract to defend army weapons systems from cyber electromagnetic activities. This award builds on the R&D and field testing we've been doing for years, and it's another example of Dynetics\u2019 ability to transition from prototypes to fielded capability. You'll notice that cyber is a common theme on each of these wins. Cyberattacks are a persistent, vexing problem for our customers, and Leidos is a top provider of full spectrum capabilities and services. In keeping with our approach of anticipatory technology investment, we continue to focus on addressing the next generation of cyber threats, with emphasis in zero trust, quantum proof encryption, network Defense, and cyber physical systems. We also anticipated the convergence of cyber and AI, what we call cognitive cyber, years ago. We've matured a number of technologies and capabilities in this area into pilots that defend against AI-based cyberattacks. As a key driver of our business development strategy, we'll continue to invest in differentiators in areas of critical importance to our customers. Fourth, we're executing a multi-phase, strategic sharpening under the effort we call Leidos Next, a robust journey to unlock the next level of technological innovation, the next level of execution and performance, and the next level of customer success. The goal of Leidos Next is to create a company with a much clearer and even more inspiring vision, our new North Star. We want to become the best company in the world that's solving a core set of problems for our customers and the best employer in the world, hiring and retaining the most talented people in order to do this. This is the essence of Leidos Next. As an enabler of Leidos Next, we will be simplifying our organizational structure to promote operational excellence, allow for faster decision-making, and more tightly align our business around key technology discriminators. This more focused, capability-oriented structure will better enable us to create clear, differentiated growth strategies for each market we serve, allow for more targeted and efficient investment in the highest areas of potential, and enable repeatable solutions to drive profitable growth. Each new sector has ample room for expansion, while benefiting from the collective strength and scale of our $15 billion company.  Beginning in 2024, we\u2019ll operate in five sectors that are focused on specific defined capability sets we bring to our customers. Health and Civil will deliver customer solutions with unique capabilities in the areas of public Health, care coordination, life and environmental sciences, and transportation. National security will combine all our technology-enabled services and mission software capabilities for Defense and intel customers in the area of cyber, logistics, security operations, and decision analytics. Commercial and international will combine our existing SES commercial energy, UK, and Australian businesses. Digital modernization will bring together our IT operations and digital transformation programs. This will allow us to serve all our digital transformation customers with better scale and speed brought about by better repeatability of best-in-class solutions with greater efficiency. And lastly, Defense systems will combine elements of Dynetics and our prior Defense business to develop and produce advanced space, aerial, surface, and subsurface manned and unmanned Defense systems. By streamlining the organization and encouraging decision-making at the appropriate levels, we\u2019ll be more efficient and responsive to market changes and customer needs. I'm also upgrading several existing executive leadership team positions. We'll centralize strategy, business development, marketing, communications, government relations, all in one value stream under a new Chief Growth Officer. As such, we'll rejuvenate our customer-centric business approach. Our new Chief Performance Officer position will spearhead program execution to ensure that we keep our commitments to customers, as well as drive cost efficiencies through world class supply chain management, IT delivery, and real estate portfolio management. Lastly, our Chief Technology Officer will now also lead LinC, the Leidos Innovation Center, adding even more emphasis on (technology) innovation and development, and making a profound organization-wide commitment to discovering, developing, and deploying market-differentiating technology, Golden Bolts. We're placing technology innovation at the forefront of our sharpened Leidos Next North Star strategy. Later this week, we'll announce our sector presidents and those who will serve in these key positions. Finally, as I mentioned on our last call, a key element to our approach going forward will be disciplined resource allocation both internally and externally. Internally, last quarter we acted to refine our investment strategy toward those areas of best overall value to the enterprise. Our BD teams have removed opportunities that do not have a clear path to an acceptable market and are reallocating our resources and realigning our pipeline to better achieve top and bottom-line growth for Leidos. Externally, as promised, our team deployed capital during the third quarter towards debt reduction to reach and slightly surpass our previously announced target leverage ratio of three times gross debt to EBITDA. After reaching this milestone, and with near-term acquisitions not a priority for this business, I recommended, and the Board of Directors approved, the first increase in our dividend in over two years. Shareholders of record on December 15 will receive a dividend of $0.38 a share, a 6% increase over our past dividend. Our strong balance sheet enables us to deploy additional capital to shareholder returns. With a stock price that does not fully capture our earnings and cash generation power, we expect share repurchase to be a primary focus for excess cash in the near term. And as we look to the future, we expect earnings and cash to grow, and remain committed to this disciplined capital management and deployment policy. In closing, we're building momentum with two successful quarters as we work toward ending 2023 in a position of strength. Our Q3 results speak to our ability to focus, grow the business, grow earnings, and generate robust cash conversion. I'm very excited about our new organizational alignment for 2024, our new North Star coming into focus, and indications of the full potential of this business becoming evident.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris for more detail on our financial performance and updated outlook. Chris Cage : Thank you, Tom. Despite our GAAP loss, our third quarter operating results were positive across the board, and speak to the underlying strength of the team, market position, and management discipline. Revenue growth, profitability, and cash conversion all improved not only year-over-year, but also compared to a very strong Q2. Our enhanced outlook puts us on track for an excellent 2023. Turning to Slide 5, revenues for the quarter were $3.92 billion, up 9% compared to the prior year quarter. Revenue growth has accelerated each quarter this year and was ahead of our long-term target in Q3. Growth was robust in all three of our reporting segments, especially in Health. Customers continued to expand scope on existing contracts ahead of an uncertain budget environment. Adjusted EBITDA was 451 million for the quarter, up 21% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 120 basis points to 11.5%. I'll get a little more granular later, but big picture, Civil and Defense profitability were in line with the year-ago quarter, and Health was up substantially. Non-GAAP net income was $283 million, and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.03, both up 28% compared to last year. Below EBITDA, a lower effective tax rate added about $0.08 to EPS, which offset a $0.02 headwind from increased interest expense. Turning to the segment drivers on Slide 6, Defense Solutions revenues increased 7% year-over-year. The largest growth catalyst were in digital modernization, offensive and defensive hypersonics, and our Australian Airborne Solutions business. Defense Solutions Non-GAAP operating income margin increased 30 basis points from the prior year quarter to 8.4%, with some milestone achievements and strong cost control. That said, we did have some unfavorable EAC adjustments as we wind down prototype developments on a couple of programs, which led to the 90 basis point sequential decline in margin. As we complete systems integration and add technical depth, we are committed to delivering better and more predictable returns at Dynetics. Civil revenues increased 6% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by continued recovery in security products, infrastructure spending at the FAA, and increased demand for engineering support to commercial energy companies. Civil non-GAAP operating income margin was 10.4% compared to 11% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year segment profitability decreased as a result of the mix of security product sales. The changes that we've implemented, including a leaner cost structure, improved supply chain and rationalized product and geographic portfolio, will stabilize and enhance the margin going forward, and did contribute to the 130 basis point sequential increase in Civil non-GAAP margins.  Health revenues increased 18% over the prior year quarter, driven by higher levels of medical examinations and growth on our Social Security Administration\u2019s IT work. Non-GAAP operating income margin came in at 20.4%, compared to 15% in the prior year quarter. The increase in segment profitability was driven primarily by the increased volumes from PACT Act and strong incentive fee performance in the medical examination business. In addition, we received an equitable adjustment to cover costs incurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This adjustment added $14 million to both revenue and operating income, similar to the recovery incurred in the second quarter of 2022. We'll operate in and report on these three segments through Q4, and then we'll move to the five-sector structure that Tom described. For financial reporting segmentation, we'll combine the national security and digital modernization sectors based on their similar economic characteristics. The remaining three sectors, Health and Civil, Defense Systems, and Commercial and International, will be their own reporting segments. We believe the new segmentation will enhance visibility and provide investors and analysts a clearer picture of Leidos going forward. We're still completing the contract-by-contract mapping into the new sectors. On our Q4 call, we'll provide supplemental disclosure to help you with modeling, including revenue and operating income for the new segments for full year 2022 and 2023.  Turning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 7. We generated $795 million of cash flow from operating activities, and $745 million of free cashflow. Cashflow benefited from strong collections and ongoing working capital improvement initiatives. In addition, we saw some benefit from our US government customers accelerating payment at their fiscal year-end. DSO for the quarter was 57 days, a two-day improvement from the second quarter of 2023. During the quarter, we paid off the remaining $200 million of commercial paper to reach our target leverage ratio of three times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA, actually achieving 2.9 times, which gives us flexibility to return capital to shareholders. We ended the quarter with $750 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $4.7 billion of debt.  Tom mentioned the non-cash charge recorded this quarter, so let me provide some additional details around that. There are three basic components that are add-back to net income from the statement of cash flows, a goodwill impairment of $599 million, asset impairment of $88 million, and $12 million of inventory and other assets associated with product lines we are exiting. Goodwill and asset impairments are both separate lines on the income statement and cash flow statements. The restructuring charge for inventory is included within the $19 million other line in the statement of cash flows, and then within cost to revenues on the income statement. The vast majority of the charges are associated with SES, but we also held a small unprofitable asset within Dynetics for sale, resulting in an $11 million impairment. The sale has been completed and will be reflected in our Q4 financials. In both the SES and Dynetics impairments, we've taken action to improve the margin and earnings outlook, with no significant impact to current revenue projections. On to the forward outlook on Slide 8. Based on our strong Q3 and year-to-date results, we're raising our 2023 guidance for all metrics. We now expect revenue between $15.1 billion and $15.3 billion, an increase of $150 million at the midpoint. Profitability has been a key focus area over the last two quarters, and the team has delivered. Our new adjusted EBITDA range is 10.5% to 10.7%, an increase of 40 basis points on the bottom, and 20 basis points on the top of our previous guidance. With an improving revenue and margin outlook, we're raising our non-GAAP diluted EPS $0.40 at the low end, and $0.30 at the high end, to $6.80 to $7.10. and we're raising our operating cashflow target by $150 million to at least $850 million for the year, which is right at our year-to-date performance. Let me put some context around our guidance related to the current budget environment. We're hopeful that Congress will be able to avoid a shutdown, but in the spirit of promises made, promises kept, our guidance explicitly includes our current assessment of the risk of a government shutdown. A potential full 45-day shutdown could put us closer to the bottom end of guidance for revenue in EPS. A shutdown\u2019s impact on cash flow is harder to predict. We expect to generate operating cash flow in the fourth quarter, but our revised cash guidance reflects the possibility of a modest disruption associated with the potential government shutdown. Our strong balance sheet positions us well to navigate this potential headwind.  With that, Shamali, we're ready to take some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Matt Akers : Yes. Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess to follow up on SES, curious if you could give us an update on some of the insourcing activities and how that's going, if you're still on track for Charleston kind of early next year. Chris Cage : Yes, Matt, thanks for the call and the question. Yes, definitely, the team has continued to make steady progress over the course of the last few quarters, and Charleston is really important to our future strategy. We are on track. It's something that will go live, whether it's late Q1, early Q2. We've launched our hiring campaign. We're working on outfitting the facility. So, that's still tracking to where we want it to be, and we've made other progress as it relates to various supply chain improvements over the course of the quarter. So, again, one of the reasons why the Civil margins trended up this quarter was the SES business showing some signs of improvement, and we're really happy with that progress. Tom Bell : I would just add, Matt, that while your question was tactical, so I wanted Chris to go first, I'm glad the first question was about SES, because while it's unfortunate we have to take the impairment charge, the fact is, we're all very bullish about the prospects of this business going forward. In fact, I referenced in my comments, changing customer buying behavior. Over in Europe at a major trade show, we recently unveiled two new products that directly speak to this changing customer buying behavior. A Pro :Vision 3 people scanner, which features wideband AI-based gender-neutral algorithms for higher quality imaging and detection, something that customers are asking for the technology to be faster and better. And more important to me, a product we call ProSight, which is a secure and scalable enterprise platform that integrates a customer's diverse suite of screening machines and operations that allow them to create a system-wide view of their security operations at any airport or any lane. So, very excited about not only the tactical decisions the team is making to right-size the business for the future, but also the forward investment in future products that will allow us to compete and win going forward in both the regulated market and the commercial market. Matt Akers : Great, thanks. And then I guess as a follow-up, could you touch on kind of the cash flow? I guess the Q4 cash is implied a lot weaker. Is that just kind of timing of the working capital, like you mentioned? Is there anything else kind of one-time in there. Chris Cage : Yes, no, Matt, nothing more than that. Obviously, we're very pleased with the third quarter performance, and that allowed us to raise our full-year guidance by the $150 million. We're navigating the risk around a shutdown and the potential challenges that may or may not pose. We're hopeful to be able to exceed that performance level. And the other thing is, we did certainly experience some benefit, as I mentioned, of customers paying a few things early as we closed out Q3. So, team\u2019s motivated to finish the year strong, but we'll just be cautious as we navigate what our government customers do going into Q4. Matt Akers : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bert Subin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Bert Subin : Hey, good morning, and congrats on the strong quarter. As we think about - hey, Tom, and Chris. This is probably for Chris. As we think about 3Q performance relative to future earnings, were there items in the quarter that you anticipate do not recur outside of the $14 million Health benefit you just mentioned? Your no-shutdown case for earnings in 4Q is expected to be closer to just shy of $1.80, which is still a step-down from 3Q when factoring in that benefit and the tax benefit. So, I'm just curious if there was pull-forward of security products or, something unordinary, or if the business is just performing really well. Chris Cage : Yes. I'd say, kind of our base outlook, Q4 looks a little bit like Q2. Bert, there wasn't anything other than the $14 million that we highlighted that was what I'd consider to be a one-timer. The Health business performed exceptionally well. When you normalize that one-time benefit out, the margins were still in the high 18% range. We did see strong performance from PACT Act's caseload. We did see strong incentive fee performance around that as well. And those are things that could moderate a little bit quarter-to-quarter. But on the contrary, I also pointed to the fact that Defense stepped back a little bit due to some EAC adjustments, and those are things that we don't expect to recur on an ongoing basis. So, Q4, hopefully, we're right down the middle. We will see where the government shutdown risk takes us, but really pleased, quite honestly, with the progress we're seeing across the business on margin and revenue growth. Bert Subin : Yes. Great. Maybe just as a follow-up there, both on the Health and the Defense side, I guess there's three big contracts to think about. There's DES. there's CHS-6, and there's DHMSM. Can you just give us maybe some - a viewpoint on sort of how we should think about those contracts going forward? I know DHMSM was expected to be a headwind. It doesn't seem like that's happened yet. Maybe you're repurposing some of that ceiling value. So, I'm just curious how you think those are going to - those two are going to ramp up and then DHMSM\u2019s going to step down. Tom Bell : Well, let me jump in first, Bert, if you don't mind. I'll talk about DHMSM first and then we'll take them from there. Obviously, we're very, very pleased and proud of the team and how they deployed DHMSM to great customer satisfaction to date. It's about 91% deployed, with 7.3 million Conus beneficiaries out of 9.6 million that we envision full-time. And we're on track to deliver to all the DoD locations by the end of this year. But what's more exciting to me is, while most of us, and most of my first six-month conversations with analysts have been about what are we going to do when DHMSM trails off, what I learned this past quarter is, actually this program is just in the first phase of a three-phase program that the customer expects regarding the whole suite of programs around Health margins. So, what is interesting to me is how our excellent customer satisfaction and performance to date positions us not only to continue to work on the program of DHMSM, but also puts us in a great position to compete for the follow-on efforts and the rest of the efforts that the customer is looking for. So, I'm actually very excited about where we're going. Chris Cage : Yes. Well, I am too, Tom, and I think that this definitely has a horizon, a next horizon to it, Bert. And we've talked about trying to, once the system got deployed, add more capabilities. And to that point, the team was very successful. We won a contract this quarter, not huge, but it's a relatively shorter duration contract digital-first under the DHMSM umbrella. And that is starting on the next phase that Tom was just talking about, taking - digitalizing the information to digitalization and how patient benefits are extended and modernized. And so, that will help moderate the impact of the deployments coming to an end. It is lower in Q4 than it had been earlier this year because of the deployment phases, but we're able to see line of sight to holding kind of at the Q4 level going into 2024, which is excellent. And then quickly on the other two, DES, hey, it's performing as expected and we're seeing some ramp-up consistent with what we said last quarter. A couple of nice task orders are in the hopper right now, multi hundred-million-dollar task orders. Tom Bell : Well, in fact, we just got a major award this quarter of $274 million in DES, and there's likely another one even larger in the near term. Chris Cage : That's right. So, it will be a growth catalyst for us in 2024. And then finally CHS-6, Tom highlighted, very proud of the team to prevail without a protest. Won't see any notable activity from that in 2023, but we're positioned for it to be a growth catalyst in 2024. And too early to speculate until we get a little bit more clarity on what those task orders are, but we're rounding out the catalog. Customer seems very motivated to use us to buy as much of the C5 ISR activity as they can to support their mission. So, really excited about getting that one up and running. Tom Bell : Yes, and just to pile on that one, Bert, if you don't mind, so proud of the team. The RFP asked for a transition plan of 60 days. The team accomplished it in 19 days to be fully up and running for the customer in this important part of their value stream. So, just so super excited about the team that was able to lean into that and satisfy the customer quickly out of the blocks. Bert Subin : Super helpful. Thank you, Tom, and Chris. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mariana Perez Mora with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Mariana Perez Mora : Good morning, everyone. I have two questions. First one is more like big picture. How should we think about the organizational structure in terms of timing, how long, how much it's going to cost, and how should we think about the cost structure and workforce once this is done? Tom Bell : Yes, thanks, Mariana. So, first of all, we will operate in the current structure through the rest of this year. So, in fact, in all of my communications to the Leidos team, I've been hammering home, stay focused, stay focused on the current organizational structure. Our customers rely on us, and I'm relying on the team to deliver on our promises this year to our customer. The new organizational structure that I articulated will take place on January 1st. And frankly, it is not a reorganization. It's simply a realignment of the existing Leidos business in a post-pandemic fresh look at the organization for efficiency and effectiveness, and that's really the main goal. How do we increase repeatability, increase our prowess going to the markets? How do we satisfy customers with better products across customers where they tended to be siloed in the last organizational construct we had? And so, it's my expectation that the new organization is going to unlock all sorts of revenue and profit opportunities. In that regard, one of the first things I'll be doing in the new year is challenging the new executive leadership team to create full potential growth plans for each of the new five businesses. And in those full potential growth plans, we'll be looking at the marketplace, the competition, the whole suite of technologies and capabilities we need to compete and win effectively. And I expect that we'll see growth plans for each business that are unlocking growth that is currently squelched or squandered in the current environment. So, I'm very hopeful about it. In terms of costs, Chris. Chris Cage : Less is better, but listen, that's not the primary motivation to do this, as Tom talked about. I do see each of these businesses having different objectives as it relates to that. In the example of Defense systems, hey, we have been investing and we will continue to invest more in engineering and technical depth. That is not a cost-driven exercise to get those businesses aligned effectively. But in the case of digital modernization, these repeatable solutions, this automation, obviously, those can lead to more efficient delivery structures, back-office structures, those types of things. So, we're very excited to get to the full potential, and we'll have a lot more to share on that, Mariana, as we get to that next call at Q4. Mariana Perez Mora : Thanks so much. And then my follow-up is more specific to healthcare. Incentive fee performance on the medical examination was strong once again. Could you please measure that for the quarter and give us a sense of how are your expectations for that too, like in the near term to come down or not? Chris Cage : Yes, Mariana, absolutely. This is an area where the customer's always had both incentives and disincentives associated with these contracts. And earlier this year, as the PACT Act volume was ramping up, they modified some of those. And the team has been doing an excellent job not only on throughput, volume, but customer satisfaction, timeliness, et cetera. The customer is motivated to raise the bar yet again because they want to make sure we're continuing to deliver against a high volume of demand. So, we'll continue to recalibrate on what that full potential looks like. But I would just say that we're excited about the prospect of those incentives continuing to contribute, not only in the fourth quarter, but as we look ahead in 2024. Tom Bell : Yes, and just if you don't mind, Mariana, me piling on, so proud of the team. And frankly, as a taxpayer, proud of the customer. The customer should be challenging us to raise our standards and raise expectations each contract. And so, they did. We performed. We - through strikes - they changed the strike zone and tightened it up a little bit. And so, I have every expectation that the team can throw strikes even better in 2024 than they did in 2023. Mariana Perez Mora : Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Cai von Rumohr : Yes, terrific. Thank you very much. Great results, guys. To maybe follow up on Mariana's question, so if we take out the $14 million COVID, which was kind of prior period, you did $18.6 million, which is terrific in Health. Could you quantify how big were the incentive accords in that quarter? And give us some sense if they've tightened it up. I mean, are they going to tighten it so those margins go down? Because I think at one point, you were hoping to do mid-teens. It now looks like you're doing $18.5 million, $18.6 million this quarter. So, where's that likely to go? And what impact do you see from potential government shutdown, because you mentioned that as a potential issue going forward. Chris Cage : Yes, Cai, let me get going here, and if Tom wants to add on, he can. Look, we're not going to quantify the specifics around the incentives. I would just say that this year, if you look at 2023, we will not have a full year worth of those incentives in our results. So, the good news is, 2024, we expect that to be something that can contribute for a full year, but also we'll have to step up our game relative to the customer increasing the standards because we all want to make sure the veterans are being well served, that our timeliness stays high, that the throughput stays high, and the quality stays high. So, it's been a nice benefit. We have incentive fee structures across a variety of contracts, and our objective is to deliver exceptional service and try to maximize those. These ones just happen to be more noteworthy. But big picture on Health, we had previously said a mid-teens was a good margin level for the business. Obviously, we think we can do better, and we are doing better than that now. And whether that's in the 17%, 18% zone, we'll endeavor to sustain that level of performance. On the shutdown, this is an imperfect science, but we've spent a lot of work because we got so close at the end of September. Big picture we think on the order of $100 million-ish of revenue, potential risk, $10 million to $15 million of OI risk that we're managing through. I mean, the most important thing is we work hand in glove with our customers right up to the deadline, and that we work with our employees to make sure they understand what they're to do if they're unable to perform on the customer mission. And hopefully, we'll find an opportunity to get back to work quickly if it were to happen. But that's kind of our current assessment, but it's one that we will continuously refresh as we work through a write-up to a potential deadline. Tom Bell : But again, just to foot-stomp at a little bit, Cai, as Chris mentioned in his comments, the risk of a full 45-day shutdown is included in the lower end of our guidance. So, consistent with promises made, promises kept, given the risk of a full 45-day shutdown is possible, the guidance incorporates that risk. Chris Cage : I mean, the good news, Cai is, we have a lot of funded backlog. We have a lot of essential programs, and we're well positioned to navigate these headwinds. Cai von Rumohr : So, just to be clear, as a follow-up, the $100 million and the $10 million to $15 million in OI, that is for Health or that is across the company? Chris Cage : No, no, no, across the company, Cai. As it relates to Health, that's probably one of the least impacted areas. So, that's across the company. Tom Bell : Veterans is an essential service. Chris Cage : That's right. Cai von Rumohr : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning, guys. Thank you for the time. So, I wanted to ask about Dynetics and just how comfortable you guys feel with the development programs there, and what sort of hurdles you're looking to get through to sort of get through the development stage into production on those. Tom Bell : Yes, thanks Sheila, and good to speak to you again. On Dynetics, I'm convinced and we are convinced that the best days are still ahead of us. We've got a great management team down there. And as I alluded to in my comments, we're adding technical and financial expertise to Dynetics to ensure its success going forward. So, feel really good about the team and feel really good about the people who are eager to go help us find success and be successful at Dynetics and in our Defense business. The team down there is really focused on those three major markets that I have spoken to now for four, five months, which is small satellite payloads, hypersonics, and force protection. And on each of them, we are tracking, Sheila, biweekly the actual burn-down plan and the tasks that we have to hit to find success, not only as we turn the page from 2023 into 2024, but through 2024. So, we've got a complete roadmap that the team is knocking down purposefully one by one. Are there challenges? Always. Supply chain challenges, testing challenges, customer-focused challenges? There's all sorts of challenges that the team is having to wrestle to ground, but they're on it. We're engaged, both at the Pentagon and at the operational level. The customer demand for the solutions in those three spaces is acute, and frankly, world events that are happening right now only heighten their desire for these solutions that we're providing. So, we feel very good about them, and I think that Dynetics is going to benefit from being a part of this new figure Defense business in the organization of 2024, where even more broad engineering program management and technology capabilities will be brought to bear for the benefit of Dynetics and in our Huntsville teammates. Chris Cage : Yes, Sheila, I mean, obviously, it's a high priority item. We're putting all the right resources on it and very excited about the long-term prospects there. In any event, Dynetics will be a growing business for us in 2024. The higher, steeper ramp, the inflection point on related to IFPC moving to fuller volumes could be later in the year, could trend to 2025. But all signs point to that continuing to be the capability the Army's focused on deploying. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay. I'll follow up on that later, but on the backlog, Tom, I wanted to ask about this since you mentioned it in your prepared remarks. I think you said it grew $4 billion, and the last time we chatted, you mentioned you added a criteria about EBITDA margins to potential wins. So, can you talk about how you think EBITDA margins should be on some of these new wins that you have in the pipeline now? Tom Bell : Well, you're right, Sheila. What I am doing as we talk about the pipeline for business development opportunities across all the businesses is, we're adding the criteria of, well, what is the expected margin? And that's why in my comment, I talked about not only the increase in the backlog, but that increase supporting our margin and cash expectations for Leidos. So, you could assume that the general health of the pipeline has increased in - has been accretive in the margin potential, and is very much on track with helping us stay a very profitable, cash-accretive business in the future. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer with Truist. Please proceed with your questions. Jack Wilson : Yes. Good morning, this is Jack Wilson on vent, Tobey. Could you dig down a little bit more into that reallocation of business development resources sort of in light of pursuing that higher margin work? Tom Bell : Sure. I mean, it's not really rocket science. It's simply looking at the pipeline, Jack, and making sure that where we are spending the talents of our people are on the opportunities with the highest P win and the highest benefit to Leidos. It was that each business area in Leidos was given a general growth target, which was generally the same for each businesses, and that's not my philosophy. My philosophy is, we're running one company called Leidos. We're trying to grow the topline and bottom line of Leidos. And as opportunities ebb and flow between the five businesses that we have today, or the five businesses that we'll have in 2024, the key is that we aggregate business development resources and talent to those areas that are going to have the biggest bang for the buck. And so, that's really all it is. Instead of trading resources chasing low margin work, because each business was incentivized to grow no matter what, I am interested in growing Leidos as a whole. And sometimes that means some businesses will grow disproportionately to others. Chris kind of touched on this a little bit. In the future, not all five businesses for Leidos will have the same topline and bottom-line goals. I'll be measuring those and putting them out there for the team, commensurate with the market that they're in, the potential of that market, and the competitions and the opportunities that present themselves in that market for the next year, two years, three years, four years. And that's the whole philosophy of redeploying the business development time and talent to those areas of greatest return for Leidos, therefore, our customers, and by extension our shareholders. Jack Wilson : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Seth Seifman : Hey thanks very much and good morning, everyone. Just maybe to follow up a little bit on that question about relative growth rates and kind of the new sectors that you laid out. Not expecting any kind of numerical targets or anything like that, but just in a relative sense, how should we think about the growth rates in those different sectors that you laid out relative to each other and also how it fits in, Tom, with your internal capital deployment plans? Tom Bell : Yes, thank you, Seth. Great question, and you're right. I'm not going to get to specifics because frankly, we don't have them yet, but I have hypotheses. And so, the hypotheses is, if you look at the five businesses, some of them are positioned for topline growth because of customer demand and interest in solutions that they can provide. Other businesses, we're going to be calling them sectors going forward, they are more and aggregation of programs so as to bring better bottom-line results. My hope is that in time, each business over time, over five, six years, topline growth and bottom-line growth may be countercyclical in businesses, but that doesn't mean I ever think any business is not also a topline growth story, and also a bottom-line growth story. So, we'll be using 2024 to have a very purposeful strategic planning exercise around, what is the full potential of each business? Where are they in the customer's ecosystem? How does the customer's buying behaviors, how do we predict they'll unfold in the coming year? And therefore, what are the goals and objectives for that business in the near term and the long term? And business development resources, technology resources, will be deployed according to those plans. It's simply going to be, the money is going to follow the plans that have survived the scrutiny of the strategic planning process, and therefore have the most merit for investment of our capital. That's it in a nutshell. And as Chris suggested, we're excited about 2024 and going through that strategic planning process and sharing more results with you over time as those come to fruition. Seth Seifman : Great. Thanks, Tom. Thanks very much. And maybe just for a quick follow-up, a little more model-focused. As we think out and we think about uses of cash and capital deployment other than - I would assume that there would be an intention to repay the $500 million that's due in 2025, just given that it's a pretty low coupon and would probably need to be replaced with something higher. And other than that, should we think about the potential for most cash to be returned? Chris Cage : Yes, I mean, big picture, Seth, I think you're thinking of it right. We hit our leverage target. We're happy with where we are. The interest rate environment could be vastly different in 2025. So, that's something we'll pay close attention to, but I think you've got it right. We've got a dividend program. Tom just talked about an increase that uses a little over $200 million a year of cash, a CapEx program at around 1% to 1.5% of revenue. And then we've got a lot of excess cash that we\u2019ll generate, not only in the fourth quarter, but next year. Delevering further at this time is not a priority, but it's always something we'll evaluate relative to the interest rate environment much. Tom Bell : It'd be a nice problem to have. Seth Seifman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Louie DiPalma : Tom, Chris, and Stuart, good morning. Within healthcare, you referenced how DHMSM could be stable going into 2024. How should we think about the VA healthcare exam volumes going forward with the tailwind of the PACT Act? And has there been any changes in the competitive dynamic there? Chris Cage : Yes. Hey, Louie. Again, just a clarification on DHMSM, stable relative to our Q4 kind of exit rate, right? It'll be - it's been trending a little lower as deployments have ramped down, but the good news is we, at this time, don't see a significant of a step-down in 2024 as we once did. So, that's great news. On the VA side, listen, I mean you always have competitors that are highly motivated to ensure they are stepping up their game to capture as much of the allocation as possible. And the VA wants a robust competitive dynamic because we need to keep the throughput high and give veterans the benefits that they deserve. At this time, it's hard to predict 2024. we'll have more color in a few months, but we see that stable and it's been a growing part of the portfolio. And there's other good things going on in the VA too. The RHRP program - sorry, in Health, the RHRP program will continue to be a growth catalyst for us as well. So, it's not just the PACT Act volume, but right now that's trending very favorably, and we're very pleased with the performance of the Health leadership team and really delivering great results. Louie DiPalma : Excellent. Thanks. Stuart Davis : Thank you. Shamali, looks like we have time for just about one more question. Operator : Sure, no problem. And our last question comes from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ken Herbert : Yes, good morning, Tom, and Chris, and Stuart. Thanks for squeezing me in. Hey Tom, maybe just to take a step back, I appreciate all the details you've outlined here in terms of the sharper focus, and obviously reflected in the backlog and the wins and everything else. But as you think about the business now transitioning into 2024, what do you think are the biggest opportunities from a cost standpoint as we think about sort of the margin opportunity? Obviously, not looking for specifics in guidance, but how much of a cost standpoint do we think there is in the business, which obviously should support what you're doing in terms of the higher quality bids and business opportunities? Tom Bell : Yes, well, I can't put a number on it because we're only now at the point where we can start to imagine the opportunities that are in front of us. But I'll call your attention to the three functional leaders that I talked about enhancing their positions. First and foremost, the Chief Technology Officer. Bringing LinC into our Chief Technology officer is going to help us become more efficient and more effective at creating and deploying technologies for the benefit of all of our businesses. I am really excited about focusing our R&D pipeline on those areas of technology that will propel our current business, enable us to compete and win and insert technology in those businesses, and win new businesses going forward. So, I think there's great opportunity for us in the CTO office. In the CPO office, the Chief Performance Officer, that is the internal wheelhouse of everything that makes Leidos an efficient, effective corporation. I mentioned real estate, procurement, IT, program management, are all going to be in that. The new leader of our Chief Performance Officer will have the responsibility to not only make sure we are best-in-class when it comes to the quality of the product we put on the field to make Leidos as effective as possible, but I'll also be asking that individual to ensure we are world class as a cost of doing business at the corporate level. And then last but not least, aggregating the complete value stream of growth, strategy, sales, marketing, communications, government relations, all in the Chief Growth Officer, will put us in a prime position to ensure we have unparalleled customer understanding for where the customer's going and how we're going to skate to the puck of where it's going to be, as opposed to just chasing RFPs. So, the net sum of all of that, Ken, I believe will make us a more efficient and effective corporation. But again, as Chris said, it\u2019s not - this isn't a cost-cutting exercise, this realignment. This is aggregate the capabilities of Leidos in a better way to make us more effective and efficient. Chris Cage : Yes, and I'd only say, I mean, we're already seeing and feeling kind of a leaner ongoing operating environment now, and that's showing up in our results. Clearly, we are focused on next year's 10.5% plus margin target. That's an area that I think we're demonstrating that we have line of sight to delivering on that. And that's still a goal the corporation's rallying behind. Ken Herbert : Great. I'll leave it there. Thanks for the color and nice quarter. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Stuart Davis for any closing remarks. Stuart Davis : Well, thank you, Shamali, for your assistance on this morning's call, and thank you all for your interest in Leidos this morning. We look forward to updating you again soon. Have a great day. Operator : And this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

After the speakers presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Stuart Davis, of Investor Relations. Stuart, you may begin. Stuart Davis : Thank you, operator, and good morning everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Tom Bell, our CEO, and Chris Cage, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you'll also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we are using today. Turning to slide two of the presentation, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, as shown on slide three, we\u2019ll discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in today's press release and presentation slides. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom Bell, who will begin on slide four. Tom Bell : Thank you, Stuart, and good morning everyone. It's good to be with you today to report another strong quarter for Leidos and to put a bow on a very successful 2023. I'll frame my part of our conversation today in three parts. First, our 2023 results; second, the progress we've made towards building a brighter future; and third, what you can expect from us this year. First in our fourth quarter we delivered 8% revenue growth for record quarterly revenue just shy of $4 billion. EBITDA margin was an outstanding 11.4% and we grew non-GAAP diluted EPS at 9% year-over-year. Operating cash was also well ahead of plan. This means we delivered full year results that were above the high end of the guidance we set last quarter. For the full year revenue growth was 7%. Non-GAAP diluted EPS growth was 11% and operating cash flow growth was 17%. Consistent with my previous commitment to you about disciplined cash management, we repurchased more than $200 million worth of shares in the fourth quarter of 2023. I continue to be very impressed by the people and sound business engine we have here at Leidos and I believe our top and bottom line financial performance over the last three quarters of 2023 just begins to hint at our full potential. Even while affecting our recent organizational realignment, the team ran through the tape to deliver an impressive 2023. I want to thank my leadership team and our 47,000 people who made these results possible through their hard work and dedication to both Leidos and our customers\u2019 missions. This brings me to my second point, the progress we've made towards building a better future. We're already working well in our new capability focused organization and seeing the first fruits from these changes. For example we're sharing best practices much better across digital modernization programs for greater efficiency and efficacy. In Commercial & International, we're quickly redeveloping our growth playbook, especially internationally, which we'll use to extend several of our business lines outside the United States. And we're aggregating and better leveraging our robust engineering talent across our platform businesses within Defense Systems. As we go through this year, we'll see many more ways this new organizational structure unlocks value. Chris will describe a few of the tangible financial benefits of this realignment on which we already have line of sight. But the team and I are acting quickly on two additional critical components to building for our future, reinvigorating our business capture prowess and ensuring we remain the best employer of top talent in the market. On the business capture front, we finished the year with a solid book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 times. As we focus on building quality backlog over time, this gives us a Healthy $37 billion backlog, $8.8 billion of which is funded. Still, I believe Leidos has another gear in terms of business capture. And my new chief growth officer has stepped up to his new responsibilities in this regard with vigor. He shares my passion for winning, and we are committed to delivering industry-leading win rates and above market organic growth. My Chief Technology Officer is aggressively focusing our total IRAD expenditures in select areas to ensure we always have differentiated solutions for our customers. And my HR lead is undertaking an intense effort to rebuild our entire employee value proposition, so we remain the best employer in the market for the best talent. Cindy Gruensfelder joins Leidos to lead our Defense System Sector. She brings extensive Aerospace and Defense leadership expertise and is excited to take this part of our portfolio to the next level. And Dan Antle will rejoin Leidos as General Counsel in April. So he will be able to hit the ground sprinting with us. As a result of these and other changes I've made, 75% of my ELT is now new in new positions or have newly enhanced in more focused areas of responsibilities. The momentum is building having the right people in the right positions, rightly aligned. Not only is this team rightly aligned to the jobs they now perform, but I've recommended and the board has approved fundamental changes to our incentive compensation plans. This means our incentives are much better aligned to our shareholders and customers' interests. These changes are fully laid out in our upcoming proxy statement, but big picture, you'll see simpler metrics around revenue, profit and cash with increased emphasis on margin, while retaining a heavy focus on relative TSR performance. This brings me to my third point, expectations for 2024. Chris will provide specifics on our 2024 financial commitments in a few minutes. Notably, our guidance fulfills the three-year commitments that were articulated on our previous Investor Day. We've already exceeded the margin target that we set in 2021, and this level serves as a great foundation from which to grow in the future. Our three-year cash conversion results ought to be right at, at 100% target, which is the right level of performance for our business. And we have clear line of sight to our three-year revenue growth target. While it is important to me that we meet our prior commitments to you, I expect us to do better going forward. Our financial performance should be at or near the top of the industry. And to bring this improved profitable growth trajectory to life, 2024 will include deep strategic analysis within Leidos. Let me summarize this strategy process for you. Each new sector president will bring forward a best-in-class three-to-five year growth and profitability plan for their markets in a today-forward view. And our growth and technology organizations will work together to create a proprietary hypothesis of the future, a future back look at customer challenges and needs for 2033 and 2028. We'll synthesize these today forward and future back views to identify market gaps and growth opportunities, and choosing among them will enable us to crystallize our new North Star. This process is being engineered to position Leidos to lead the industry in revenue, profit, and cash growth, and we look forward to sharing our plan with you at our next full Investor Day, likely early next year. In the meantime, this year, we'll look forward to opportunities to showcase for you many of the differentiated technology solutions, what I call Golden Bolts, we already use and are creating to solve our customers' most vexing problems. Finally, you may have already noticed the launch of a new branding campaign for Leidos this year, Making Smart Smarter. While we've gained important name recognition over our first 10 years, this campaign is about capturing brand recognition for Leidos. As you can see in the example on slide five, Making Smart Smarter is centered around our people. How they and the breakthrough technologies they create in a unique ecosystem with our partners and customers truly set Leidos apart from everyone else. With these three simple words, we'll tell the story of the collective intelligence that is uniquely Leidos. Our campaign will catapult understanding of what Leidos does differently and better than anyone else, and also serve as a beacon for present and future, best of the best employees. In closing, with a growing Promises Made, Promises Kept culture at Leidos, we've put many of the commitments I've made to you over the past nine months in the done category. We've exceeded our 2023 financial commitments. We've enhanced our focus on cost controls and cash generation. We've taken down leverage substantially. We've allocated more capital to shareholders, and we've moved expeditiously to a leaner, more focused organizational structure. By delivering on our 2024 plan, we'll soon put our full 2022 to 2024 Investor Day commitments in the done category also. But we are far from done. We have a busy and productive year ahead of us at Leidos. We will continue to drive toward great full profitable growth, not just revenue growth. We will aggregate our efforts toward better customer outcomes and better business pursuits. And the new leadership team and I will be working every day to make Leidos not just successful, but awesome in every way for every stakeholder. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris for more details on our 2023 results and our 2024 outlook. Chris. Chris Cage : Thanks, Tom, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Let me echo Tom and express my gratitude to the entire Leidos team for how we executed in 2023. On balance, 2023 was an excellent year, and our financial performance was well ahead of the pace we set for ourselves at the 2021 Investor Day. Turning to slide six, revenues for the quarter were $3.98 billion. Revenues came in stronger than expected as customers continued spending despite a continuing resolution, and Congress acted to avert a government shutdown. In each quarter of \u201823, each segment grew year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $452 million for the fourth quarter for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.4%. Health sustained its excellent performance, and we saw good sequential improvement in the Defense Solutions and Civil Segments. With a keener focus on margins, we exceed our 2021 Investor Day target of 10.5% plus one year ahead of schedule. Non-GAAP net income was $276 million for the quarter and more than $1 billion for the year, which generated non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.99 for the quarter and $7.30 for the year, increases of 9% and 11% respectively. This strong bottom-line performance came despite a drag from non-operating drivers. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 25.2%. Net interest expense was a $2 million tailwind for the quarter based on debt paydown, but a $13 million headwind for the year given the higher interest rate environment. Taken together, tax rate and interest lowered non-GAAP diluted EPS by $0.13 for the quarter and $0.14 for the year. Now, for an overview of our segment results and key drivers, beginning with the revenues on slide seven. With a lot to cover today, I'll focus on the quarterly figures, but you can also see the full year comparisons on the slide. Defense Solutions revenues were up 7%, driven primarily by digital modernization, especially NGEN, offensive hypersonics and the Sentinel Program. Civil revenues were up 2% compared to the prior year quarter. The primary growth driver in the quarter was infrastructure spending by the FAA. Health continued to be a standout performer. Quarterly revenues increased 17% year-over-year, ending the year north of $3 billion. Higher levels of medical examinations was a key driver, as well as expanding capabilities on DHMSM, increasing group events on RHRP, growing our Social Security Administration work, and breaking into new customer spaces like ARPA-H. On the margin front, on slide eight, Defense Solutions showed consistently strong profitability growth. Non-GAAP operating margin was 9% for the quarter, up 40 basis points year-over-year. The increase in segment profitability was primarily attributable to improved program execution and disciplined cost management. Civil non-GAAP operating margin was 10.8% for the quarter, compared to 11.2% in the prior year quarter, which had a rich mix of security product sales. What's especially rewarding to see is sequential improvement in Civil margins for three straight quarters. Health non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 19%, which was essentially unchanged sequentially after excluding the $14 million Ecoroll adjustment received in Q3. The 470 basis point increase in quarterly margin was primarily driven by increased volumes, greater efficiency, and better program execution in the medical examination business, all of which led to higher incentive awards. Turning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on slide nine. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $304 million, and free cash flow net of capital expenditures was $226 million. Net cash provided by operating activities benefited from strong collections and working capital management. Day sales outstanding for the quarter was 56, a one-day improvement from the third quarter of 2023, and a two-day improvement from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. For the year, operating cash flow was just shy of $1.2 billion and free cash flow was $958 million for a 95% conversion rate. Excluding the $260 million of one-time cash tax impacts, primarily from Section 174, free cash flow conversion would have been 121%. In the fourth quarter we repurchased $202 million of shares and paid $51 million in dividends. As of quarter end, we had $777 million in cash and cash equivalents and $4.7 billion in debt. With a leverage ratio of 2.8x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA, we are comfortably below our three-times target. Our strong balance sheet gives us flexibility to return capital to shareholders, and we have 13 million shares remaining under our repurchase authorization. On to the forward outlook on slide 10. For 2024 we expect revenues between $15.7 and $16.1 billion, reflecting growth of 2% to 4% over fiscal year 2023. Customer demand remains strong for our products and solutions, and our programs are well insulated from significant budgetary risk. But we are erring on the side of caution given the realities of the current funding environment. The government is still operating under a continuing resolution. Although we believe Congress will likely pass a budget within the next month or so, we cannot rule out the possibility of a sequester and the year-long CR. We are also provisioning for a slight temporary revenue headwind as our business leaders shift their team's focus to higher reward opportunities for Leidos. We expect 2024 adjusted EBITDA margin to again be in the mid to high 10% range, above the target that we laid out at our October 21 Investor Day. We remain committed to long-term margin expansion. To begin the year, we are guiding to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $7.50 and $7.90 on the basis of 134 million shares outstanding. This is down an average of 4 million shares from fourth quarter levels, based on Q4 repurchases accomplished, and another 500 million of repurchases anticipated in \u201824. This level of repurchase activity still allows for significant flexibility for additional share repurchases and other responsible capital deployment. Assumed in the EPS guidance is an effective tax rate of 23% and net interest expense of $225 million. Finally, we expect another strong year of operating cash flow at approximately $1.1 billion. Fiscal year 2024 cash flow guidance reflects approximately $60 million of cash tax payments related to the Section 174. 2023 cash performance was exceptional, and we expect conversion to return to normative levels near 100% in \u201824. From a free cash flow perspective, we're targeting capital expenditures of approximately $190 million or about 1.2% of revenues. With broad bipartisan support, the House passed a tax package that restores immediate expensing of R&D costs under Section 174, with retroactive effect to 2022. The bill has yet to be taken up by the Senate. Our guidance assumes the Section 174 cost capitalization rules remain in place, so we would have additional cash to deploy if the House bill becomes law. In 2024, we'll be operating our new segment structure, and to help your modeling, we recast 2022 and 2023 financials in the new structure and filed them with our press release. Let me spend a few minutes outlining these segments and how we see them performing in 2024. The largest, National Security and Digital, includes core Defense and Intel services, digital modernization for U.S. federal customers, and our Leidos Innovation Center. Flagship programs include NGEN, AEGIS, DES, and large Cyber Analysis and Mission Software Development Contracts with the Intelligence Community. 2023 revenues for this segment were $7.2 billion, up 7% year-over-year, with non-GAAP operating income margin of 10%. In 2024, we expect revenue growth within our guided range, with margins contracting slightly. Long term, we see margin upside with shared resources and best practices across the digital modernization space. The Health and Civil Segment will deliver customer solutions with unique capabilities in the areas of public Health, care coordination, life and environmental sciences, and transportation. Key programs include our disability exam work, DHMSM, National Airspace System Support for the FAA, and our DOE and National Science Foundation based support contracts. Last year, Health and Civil generated $4.2 billion in revenues, up 7% year-over-year, with non-GAAP operating income margin 14.5%. In 2024 we expect robust growth beyond the corporate average with margins coming down slightly. This segment offers the most potential upside in \u201824 with growing examination volumes. Commercial & International combines our existing SES, Commercial Energy, UK and Australian businesses. Last year Commercial & International generated $2.1 billion in revenues, up 12% year-over-year, with about five points of growth coming from the Airborne Solutions business acquisition, and non-GAAP operating income margin of 7.8%. Based on actions taken in 2023 within SES, an indirect structure tailored to non-federal work, we expect margins to increase in 2024. Revenues however should be relatively stable and reflect a similar seasonal pattern to 2023. Finally, Defense Systems combines our core Dynetics work with our Maritime and U.S. sponsored Airborne Surveillance Support. In 2023 Defense Systems accounted for $1.9 billion in revenues, up 4% year-over-year, with non-GAAP operating income margin of 8.3%. With additional engineering discipline from the combined organization, we expect to increase margins through better program execution, but revenues should remain relatively flat compared to 2023. In the fourth quarter of \u201823, our customers accelerated Hypersonics Weapon Testing, resulting in pull through work previously scheduled for the first and second quarters of 2024. As a result, the Defense System segment revenues will be backend loaded in 2024. So rolling up to the enterprise level, we expect both revenues and margin to step down from Q4 levels in Q1 and then grow throughout the year. The Q1 step down in margins will outpace that of revenue given the timing of incentive and award fee payments, but we have good line of sight into strong margin performance for the year. With that, operator, we're ready for some questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open. Jason Gursky : Yeah, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Just kind of curious as your putting \u2013 about some of the assumptions that are going into the outlook. So I guess on two fronts. First would be kind of the assumptions that are embedded in your guidance related to the DOD budget, both in fiscal \u201824 and beyond as you think about your medium-term targets. Just kind of the growth rate that you are assuming in the DOD's budget. And then secondly, just whether you have anything in your backlog today associated with some of the supplemental funding that has been passed here over the last several years. That's the first question there. Tom Bell : Thanks, Jason. Tom here. I'll go first and then ask Chris to chime in. Macro picture, as Chris articulated, our \u201824 guidance is somewhat conservative given the funding uncertainties on Capitol Hill. So we're not leaning forward assuming that there's growth in the Defense budget this year. It all depends what Congress decides to do in the coming weeks and months. But longer term, sadly, the world is not becoming a safer place, and we don't see that customers are going to be spending less on National Security and Defense. So generally speaking, we see a 3% to 4% increase in Defense budgets over time. But we're going to model all of that as we go through this year of deep strategic analysis in \u201924, to make sure that our assumptions going from \u201825 through \u201828 are in keeping with what the budget assumption is from the Pentagon and other Intel agencies in the U.S. Chris, anything you'd like to add? Chris Cage : Yeah Jason, good to talk to you this morning and way to get us started trying to give us long-term guidance questions. But, I would say on the second part of your question relative to the supplemental, it's not an area that we've had very much exposure to at all. Some of the work that we've done there has actually been through our U.K. customer and a little bit of Airborne Support work. So that's not a \u2013 hasn't been a driver for us and therefore it's not a risk as that particular funding stream potentially, comes under some pressure going forward. Jason Gursky : Okay, great. I'll leave it at one, so the others can get in and ask some questions. Thanks gentlemen. Tom Bell : Thank you. Chris Cage : Thanks, Jason. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ken Herbert : Yeah, hey. Good morning, Tom and Chris. How are you? Tom Bell : Good Chris Cage : Good morning, Ken. Ken Herbert : Hey, I just wanted to first start on the Health segment if we could, Legacy Health Segment I guess. I mean it's been pretty significant outperformance as you've gone through \u201823 and it seems like each quarter, it continues to be better than expected. Can you just maybe walk through as you look at the guide for \u201824? I know obviously you've got now Health and Civil combined, but as you think about the Health in particular, how does that continue to trend and what's the visibility on continued strength, especially if you look at the examinations and everything else that have driven much of the upside? Tom Bell : Thanks, Ken. I'll start and then hand it over to Chris. We are so proud of Liz and the Health team for their performance, their sustained performance that you call out over time. And, it is important to recognize that that's a unique mix of unique customer understanding that we feel we have and then unparalleled service to our veterans and others that we serve through the deployment of technology and artificial intelligence in the solutions that allow us to have more throughput for our customers, so that our customers can be served faster. Obviously, 13% revenue growth for the year is based on excellent program execution and profitability and passing the $3 billion threshold for that business is huge, if you don't mind me saying. So we're very proud of Liz and the team, macro, and we see that continuing in \u201824. Chris? Chris Cage : Yeah Ken, just to add on a little bit, obviously the disability examination work has been a standout, but there's a lot more going on as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, and really looking to extend our reach on some existing programs and there's plenty more new programs in the pipeline the team's pursuing, so excited about the prospects there. As we said in our guidance, we'll continue the outperformance from a top-line growth perspective heading into \u201824. On the margin front, a slight pullback, but that's really because we're continuing to invest, we're investing in our capabilities, we're investing to improve the workflow and the infrastructure to allow for that increased volume on the disability exam front. And really what's important about that is making sure the veterans get served and we love to see those volumes increase. And clearly that's not a baseline assumption in our forward guidance that we see a higher level of activity there, but it's certainly a scenario that we have to be prepared for, and so we're making sure we're ready to step up to meet that demand if it happens. Ken Herbert : Great. Thank you very much. I'll keep it there. Tom Bell : Thanks Ken. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is open. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning, Tom and Chris. Thank you so much. Two questions, if you don't mind. Maybe one big picture and then one on the segment restructuring, resegmentation. So first on the resegmentation, National Security, it seems like it mostly split off on Defense. The margins in \u201823 are about 10%. And I think Chris, you might have mentioned that there's opportunity for more margin expansion in that segment. Can you just talk about what you see there? Chris Cage : Sure. Yeah, absolutely, Sheila. Thank you. So, the National Security and Digital Segment combines a couple pieces of our business, one of which is our new digital modernization sector, and that's the one that we see a lot of uplift over time. Steve Hull and the team have already highly energized around bringing together some commonality that we've been using to serve multiple customers and bringing those into repeatable solutions. And so we're often running there and really looking at how we get that leverage from a combined bench, a combined workforce and investing class tools and repeatable solutions. So we see that opportunity. And then, of course, within the core, National Security work we do with our Intel customers, that has been exceptionally well run. And we continue to expect excellent program execution and performance and maximizing our opportunities with that client base as well. But the longer term margin improvement that we see in the near term relates to the gains we can make in digital monetization space. Tom Bell : And just for clarity, the third part of that business is our LinC, our Leidos Innovation Center. And so while that has historically been home roomed under our Dynetics subsidiary, we've pulled that up to the CTO level, so that the innovation and entrepreneurial spirit that it deploys, can be deployed for all the sectors and all the segments of Leidos. So that's the third part of that component Sheila, just for clarity. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay, got it. And then Tom, maybe a big picture for you. You talked about incentive comp changes that'll come out in the proxy. And you highlighted profitability. I think I know why you did that. But where do you think profitability could go just given peers in this business are at the 11% mark at most? Tom Bell : Yeah, how high is high? We don't know, Sheila. And that's part of the enjoyment of 2024 and the challenge that we're giving each of the sector presidents to come forward with their sector best-in-class growth and profitability plan. Obviously, we're guiding to mid to high teens in 2024. Obviously, that is already at a pretty world class level. Excuse me, high tens. Chris Cage : Mid-high 10s. Tom Bell : Yeah, high 10s, not teens. That would be... Chris Cage : Someday Tom. Tom Bell : That would be someday. But mid to high 10s. But you know, in the fourth quarter, we hit 11.4. So is cresting over 11 out of the range of possibilities some year in the future? I don't know. We'll see. But we're very focused on restoring bottom line growth as we increase top line growth. And as a result of both of them, it'll be a very accretive business from a cash standpoint. Chris Cage : Sheila, I'd only add on, obviously again, as we gave you some color commentary on the new segments, there is a lot of gas in the tank that we see on Defense Systems and Commercial & International. They'll step up in margins in \u201924, but that could be a multi-year runway for those pieces of the business and so we've been on this journey for a period of time now. Tom's come in and accelerated that journey, and I think we're seeing what the team's capable of. So excited about where the margins could go over time. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Great. Thank you. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Mariana Perez Mora with Bank of America. Your line is open. Mariana Perez Mora : Hi everyone. Tom Bell : Hey, good morning. Mariana Perez Mora : I'll follow-up on Defense Systems and Commercial & International. So you think Defense System is going to be flat this year, but hypersonic should be something that like actually has a lot of upside opportunity. And I could imagine the same from the [inaudible] in international. Could you please give us a sense of like how the CAGR should look like in a three to five year range from now? Tom Bell : So she \u2013 I'm sorry Mariana, I think you're asking about hypersonics and customer demand for hypersonics and then international. The hypersonics is a good news story. And as Chris alluded to in his comments, we saw a pull in to \u201823 of work we thought was going to be in the first half of 2024 of our customer demand signal for hypersonics. We're in deep dialogue with the customers about how we continue to accelerate that business, because that is a capability that the United States needs to deploy robustly. So again, it's kind of like I answered Sheila, I don't know how high is high, but there is very, very strong demand for the United States to field hypersonic capabilities that are in the world class range and obviously we are in a very good position to be a key component of those hypersonic systems going forward. So, I think you're going to continue to see pull through there and focus. I think on the international side one of the most exciting things we have going for us is the strong footprint we have organically and already, obviously in the United States, but also in the UK and Australia. And there is great customer interest in what Leidos can do around AUKUS, not in Pillar 1. I mean, I have no interest in building nuclear submarines, but I really am interested in helping those customers in what they call Pillar 1 and Pillar 3, which are in the Intel data and digital systems worlds. So very much in our wheeled house for what we do here in the United States and in the UK and Australia, and very much a growth engine for us should be how we leverage AUKUS going forward. Chris, anything you'd like to add? Chris Cage : Well, one more point Mariana, back to the Defense Systems. We talked about hypersonics, but in addition to that, the force protection work that we talked about in the past. The team has been working hard on the IFPC Enduring program and we're excited about the fact that we delivered some of the first fieldable prototype launchers in December. That will transition into a phase here early in the year, but we're looking forward to a potential award in that particular area on LRIP [ph] and then full rate production later in the year and that also is a growth catalyst that we see. So when you start to look at that CAGR over a multi-year time horizon, our expectations is those businesses will be accelerating, and Tom talked to a couple of key points there that we see driving that activity. Mariana Perez Mora : Thanks so much. And if I may, more of a program related question. Do you have an update on how CHS-6 is trending and how much do you expect the program to contribute into 2024? Tom Bell : Yeah Mariana, let me start and then I'll hand it over to Chris also. Obviously CHS-6, a major franchise win for Leidos in the fourth quarter of last year, one we're very proud of the team for. And it's a model that we expect to deploy going forward where we bring customers a value proposition that is compelling to them, both in the delivery we can give them and the speed with which we can spool up to solve their problems. But, one of the things that is not understood about CHS-6 is it's actually a very broad mandate for the customer and it's not just IT, it's the whole C-5 ISR domain. And so not only is it broad in what the customer can procure through CHS-6, but it's also a great example of how we can use the breadth and scale of Leidos to solve problems for customers. So not only is that home-roomed in one sector, but the Dynetics business is going to be a key part of helping it deliver for our customers. So we're very happy about that and the basic catalog is being built out and the orders are starting to come in, but Chris will give you some more details on that. Chris Cage : Yeah, just to add some color and I will stay away from specifics, but obviously this is a program we expect that will build in revenue and profitability over the life of the contract and a long contract like this does have a ramp up period. Tom's right, and we were encouraged by the order activity, some long lead items that will actually contribute to revenue in \u201825 even, but we're rounding it out. The profile is going to depend greatly upon what those particular technical solutions, but we're leveraging our vendor network, we're leveraging AI, we've got a great team. There are some activity that we're not interested in low margin work, so some of the pass through will not show up as revenue for Leidos, but overall you can expect this to be an accretive margin program to Leidos overall and with a ramping revenue profile probably more later in the year. Mariana Perez Mora : Thank you so much. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. This is actually Josh calling on for David. Tom Bell : Hey, Josh. Unidentified Analyst : So hi. I wanted to ask about the revenue guidance for next year. What when you have as you just discussed CHS-6 and ramping and some of the Health care programs really strong. What are some of the \u2013 are there any offsets to get to the only 2% to 4% growth next year? Chris Cage : Yeah David, let me start and Tom can make some bigger picture and comments. I mean we've talked in the past about Health has been great, but the DHMSM program as an example, we're through the deployment phase essentially and so even though we've won some additional work there with Digital First, there is a step down in volumes on that particular program. There was a National Security Intel program that transitioned away from us earlier last year, so that's a little bit of a headwind. So there's always some puts and takes in the portfolio, but more big picture, we're focused on \u2013 there's some budget uncertainty. Customer demand has been very strong in Q3 and Q4 and that led to our performance. But as we look ahead to early parts of the year, a lot of the activity will need to transition into Q3 and Q4. So it all depends upon how quickly get certainty in our budget environment and make sure customer demands remain robust. Tom, anything you'd add to that? Tom Bell : Well, I would just add Josh, there's two macro headwinds that informed the conservative end of our range. One was the over performance in 2023 that makes year-on-year comparators difficult, and in this case challenging. We are very proud of our performance in \u201823, but that creates a headwind for \u201824 year-on-year revenue growth, against also the backdrop of the budget situation that is not yet crystal clear here in Washington, DC. And so while the 2% provisions against the worst case scenario in that, we will be working with the team to meet or exceed the high end of that range as we prosecute the year. So you can be sure we won't be satisfied if we just hit the bottom end of that range. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Your line is open. Louie DiPalma : Tom, Chris and Stuart, good morning. Tom Bell : Good morning. Chris Cage : Good morning. Louie DiPalma : Tom, you discussed how you believe Leidos can increase its business capture. Does Leidos consider its Gremlins Air Vehicle a viable candidate for the emerging high profile drone replicator program? Tom Bell : The Gremlins program was a fantastic demonstration of our prowess in aerospace. For those that don't know it, it was a remotely piloted vehicle that was also recaptured and then brought on board another manned aircraft. So a fantastic capability. But at this point, no. No, there's no discussions going on with the customers around that program going forward, although it has spawned other unmanned capabilities that we are talking to customers about, that help inform possible growth aspects for our Defense Systems business. Louie DiPalma : Great. So is there a possibility that some of the dynamics drone assets can be involved in replicator. Tom Bell : There is certainly a possibility, yes. Louie DiPalma : Great. And a follow-up on the international opportunity. You referenced how there is demand on the international front for the Leidos data and digital services. It would seem that allies have similar IT Cloud networking and zero trust ambitions as the U.S. and you are obviously the largest provider of these types of mega projects. And I was wondering, can you bring variance of IT mega projects such as the navy NGEN the NASA AEGIS and Enclave to allies or are there security restrictions as it relates to personnel. And are you focusing more on IT services or hardware as it relates to the international opportunity. Thanks. Tom Bell : Thanks. Thanks, Louis. Yes, so the beauty of Pillar 2 of AUKUS is not only our presence in the U.S., the UK and Australia. But the fact that the work that is being done in those countries right now in the area that you referenced, is to a large degree already a place that we're playing in. So the beauty of AUKUS is an incentive for the nations to collaborate. We are very excited about the opportunities that gives us to lower the thresholds of sharing data. And obviously there's also big parts of the AUKUS legislation that lower those trade barriers, lower the ITAR restrictions and allow greater data sharing. So we see it as an open door for us to promulgate Leidos capabilities that hereto for Louis, kind of to your question, have been so piped in one country or the other across all those countries, and allow these great allies to punch above their weight collectively. Louie DiPalma : Great. That's it for me. Thanks everyone. Tom Bell : Thanks, Louis. Chris Cage : Thank you. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. Your line is open. Peter Arment : Thanks. Good morning, Tom and Chris. Excellent results. Tom Bell : Thank you. Peter Arment : Hey, a quick one on just maybe an update on DES and how that's kind of projected for the year. And then Tom just more of a bigger picture question on kind of a capital deployment versus M&A. You've done \u2013 made just a tremendous amount of progress realigning the businesses and you've turned over I think, what you said, 75% I think of your executive leadership team I see there in new roles or has been replaced. Just how are you thinking, is \u201824 more of a year where you\u2019re just going to continue to be internally focused and kind of showing the progress versus how do we think about that versus M&A and just regarding you know buybacks as a preference. Thanks. Chris Cage : Yeah Peter, it's Chris. Let me get started with a little bit of color on DES and then turn it to Tom. I mean. You know again this has been a longer growth story than we originally anticipated, but it's a nice one. The team is performing exceptionally well. We've actually extended from one task order now to five active task orders under the program, and it will be on a growth trajectory over the still the next couple years. \u201824 will be stronger than \u201823 on both the top and bottom line and we've seen good migration on the planning efforts, working closely with the customer, and the DAFA\u2019s to get them ready for more migrations as we progress through 2024. So all I can tell you is it'll be a contributor to growth this year, not as significant as maybe once envisioned, but really looking forward to that growth rate continuing to accelerate later this year and into \u201825. Tom Bell : And Peter, I'm going to answer you\u2019re \u2013 the punch line first and then give you some color. No, M&A is not a priority in 2024. It continues to be in the playbook, but subordinated to other deployments of cash. As Chris articulated in his prepared comments, we've already provisioned to repurchase $500 million worth of Leidos shares this year. I'm happy to share with you that that is not all the bullets in our ammunition. We have other ability to deploy cash for great ideas that start to come out of the strategy process that I spoke to. And we're very excited about bringing forward those ideas and deploying cash responsibly, organically in great capabilities and great technologies that will enable us to have differentiated solutions going forward. Ultimately the five sector strategies that the Presidents are building will not ignore M&A, but the primary focus first and foremost will be what are the gaps, what are the needs we see our customers needing and how do we position Leidos best for those over time. Obviously if we can build it, we have the funds and the capability to provision for that. But if it's better, faster, cheaper and more expeditious for us to buy that, then M&A can come back into the playbook. But those will be a very thoughtful process through this year of strategy, where we carefully think through the playbook for what inorganic plays make sense for the North Star strategy we're creating. I hope that helps Peter. Peter Arment : Very much so thanks. Thanks Tom. I appreciate it. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Noah Poponak : Hi. Good morning everyone. Tom Bell : Hey Noah. Chris Cage : Hey Noah. Noah Poponak : The Civil margin, I guess for the full year ended up flat year-over-year and not a ton of discussion in the prepared remarks here, I guess, despite the consternation there early in the year. So have we sounded the all clear? Maybe you could just spend a little more time on where you stand in stabilizing the challenges you've had there. And is the quarterly progression on the Civil margin through 2024 a ramp up like the last two years or is it more stable? Chris Cage : Yeah Noah. Hey, this is Chris. I'll get started and maybe Tom can talk big picture. So Civil is obviously more than SES, but that kind of is implicit is where you're going. And I really applaud the team for great progress and \u201823 to right the ship, and ultimately revenue and margins were in line with our expectations. So the SES business itself is improving. We were higher on revenues year-over-year, but minimal contribution sequentially from product mix. So as we pivot into \u201924, we'll expect the pattern to kind of not be as pronounced as in \u201923, but probably lower in the early part of the year, accelerating towards the back half of the year, how we see that rolling out right now. We're not all the way done, but we are you know well down the road on executing all of the turnaround efforts that we put in place and some of the things where we're exiting certain geographies. That's a thoughtful, carefully orchestrated process, right, that takes sometimes many quarters to fully see it through. But I'd say, we're in line with where we had hoped to be at this point in time and I think the business is looking forward to better days ahead. Tom Bell : Yeah, I would echo that Noah. And just give a quick shout out to Vicki who has taken on the responsibilities for this sector with great vim and vigor, and the person leading SES, Michael Van Gelder, just a rock star for us at Leidos. And they are taking this reset business and really they are excited about the opportunities that the market is presenting to us to grow, both in the traditional places and non-traditional places. So they and we remain bullish on the long term outlook for this business and we're excited to be in this aspect of the market. Noah Poponak : Okay, great. And then just on Health. You've sort of touched on this, but just the year-over-year comparison will be pretty different in the first half or the back half next year. And then, the exit rate on the margin is a lot different than where you started the year. Any color you can provide on the cadence of the growth rate and the margin through the quarters of the year, not to ask \u2013 like they ask quarterly questions, but just seems like we could all be kind of thrown off on versus what you're expecting there. Tom Bell : Yeah, I mean Noah, it's a little nuance there, and you know again without too many specifics, just keep in mind, in Q3 we did have a request for like a little adjustment. That contributed some uplift in profitability and Q4 we benefited from nice incentive performance. I think our commentary in the past and it still holds true is, the customer is expecting industry to continue to step up volumes to meet the increased demand and therefore the threshold on throughput continues to rise to achieve full incentive. So early in the year our expectation is we'll have some work to do to be ready to be able to prosecute that level of demand to earn full incentives. So therefore it's probably safer to assume that pattern will improve as the year progresses forward. The main point is, investing to make sure are the veterans get treated and seen and get the care and the benefits they are entitled to and we are looking forward to continue to make those investments to prosecute that work as timely as possible. Noah Poponak : Okay. Thanks so much. Tom Bell : Thank you. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bert Subin with Stifel. Your line is open. Bert Subin : Hey, good morning, Tom, Chris. Tom Bell :  Hey, Bert. Good morning. Bert Subin : Chris, if we think about the revenue growth for you in terms of hiring inflation, does 2% to 4% growth indicate you're carrying some additional costs just because inflation is going to be in that range and hiring is presumably positive. And then on, I guess, another sort of related question on the revenue side, as we think about outlays like the normalizing at some point soon, how do you capture that in that 2% to 4%? Chris Cage : Yeah Bert, obviously the inflationary environment has been volatile, but it's been improving. And so as we progress into \u201924, our outlook in that regard is it's moderated down relative to where we were a year ago. So I'm not worried that we've got an imbalance between our top line and bottom line as it relates to inflationary impacts on the business. We've anticipated a robust merit pool for our labor costs and we understand how those will be passed along to certain customers under our cost reimbursement programs. But our pricing patterns have anticipated this inflationary environment now over the last couple years. So as it relates to protecting the margin, the downside on inflation, I feel good about where we're positioned there. Obviously, on the outlay side, there's always this lag, right, between the budget and the outlay and the timing that it's difficult to project. Certainly it's an area that we could see some things accelerate in the near term, depending upon how we get through March in the budget environment. But right now I'd say that, that's not a significant driver as far as any pent up outlays that we're waiting to have, happen to drive significant growth catalyst for us. Tom Bell : And I \u2013 if you don't mind, Bert, I'm going to piggyback on that to give some comments about our people. We ended the year with 47,000 employees, up about 3% year-on-year. But the most exciting thing about our whole HR system in 2023 was attrition at very good levels for our industry, low levels for our industry. And one of the reasons we do that is not only do we have a competitive structure in our compensation plan, but we also are investing in our talented employees with technical upskilling, which is being taken up by thousands of our employees who remain curious about things like AI and Cyber and Autonomy. And the technical upskilling we have allows us to hold on to those employees and upskill them in place, because as you'll appreciate, it's one thing to pay for talent. It's a whole different ball of wax to have to constantly bring on new talent. So we're very excited about the attrition rates being low, the uptake in our technical upskilling being very high, and therefore that being a lever that we're using to manage our personnel costs. Bert Subin : Got it. Okay. Thanks, Tom and Chris. Just a follow up on \u2013 we've had a lot of questions on the VA side. I guess I'm curious, Tom, as you've gone through sort of this review of the business, how big do you want the clinical business to be? Clearly the VA-MDs have been a pretty material driver of profitability upside, and I'd have to assume the ROIC profile is sort of on the higher end of the company. Are there other meaningful opportunities out there, like not maybe the VA-MDs, but like RHRP and Military Family Counseling and others in the backlog and the pipeline that you think, could make clinical a bigger part of the business longer term? Tom Bell : Yeah, the short answer to that is, yes, we do think there are opportunities for us to grow this business, and that is the very task that Liz and her team are undertaking. It's one thing to say yes, there are opportunities. It's another thing to think how do we prudently and purposefully execute a plan to grow that business in the lowest risk possible. That's very much what Liz and her team are focused on right now and part of the process that we'll be reviewing through the year. Bert Subin : Great. Thank you for the comments. Stuart Davis : Abigail, we're at the top of the hour, so we'll just take one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our last question. One moment for our last question. Our last question comes from Matthew Akers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Matthew Akers : Yeah, hey guys. Good morning. I think we're squeezing me in. Tom, you alluded to some IRAD targeted investments in the opening remarks. Can you elaborate on those at all? What capabilities you're going after? Tom Bell : Sure. There's actually two parts of that equation, Matthew. One of the things that we're focused very much on with our link being elevated to our CTO office is CRAD [ph]. So making sure that we get customer focused IRAD, which has a two prong benefit. (A), it is doing the things that the customers need done. So that points you in the direction of what is the scratch they want to itch, but also its funded work that we can co-invest in. So we're very focused on targeting CRAD in the areas of technology that are going to differentiate us going forward, and we're very much focused on matching our investment, our IRAD in those focused areas also. Macro picture, obviously Software, Cyber, AI, Maritime Autonomy are four of the top things we're investing in. But again, as part of the strategy process, we're asking each sector to identify the Golden Bolts that will truly differentiate them over the coming three to five years, so as to give them solutions to the customer problems that are emerging over that same period of time. So we have an articulated playbook of focused IRAD. We have an articulated playbook of CRAD that we're going after, but we're also creating organically a poll from the businesses of what would you have me invest in that will differentiate my solutions and my capabilities to solve my customers problems. Matthew Akers : Great. Thanks for the color. And I guess one for Chris. On Section 174, can you just remind us how much you have you could potentially recover if that does get overturned? Chris Cage : Yeah, sure Matt. And I mean, it's a nuanced situation, so there's some variables you got to think through. Obviously, looks like it may be retroactive. And so if that were to be the case, and if there is a path forward to recovery, monies that were previously paid in the year, and then we have some state taxes that have to follow suit. If all that lines up, it could be north of $200 million of benefit to Leidos. There'd be a little bit of modest uplift on the effective tax rate. But net-net, it would be a great benefit to the company and add to that additional amount of capital we'd have to consider how we deploy appropriately in the later part of the year. So a little bit over $200 million plus, not having to pay the $60 million that we've got teed up in \u201824. So goodness all around. Matthew Akers : Great. Thank you. Tom Bell : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Stuart Davis for any closing remarks. Stuart Davis : Thank you, Abigail, for your assistance on this morning's call, and thank you all listening on the line today and this morning for your interest in Leidos. We look forward to updating you again soon. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. Please note this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll turn the conference over to Stuart Davis from Investor Relations. Stuart, you may begin. Stuart Davis : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Tom Bell, our CEO; and Chris Cage, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you'll also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll use during today's call. Turning to Slide 2 of the presentation. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, includes risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, as shown on Slide 3, during the call we'll discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in today's press release and presentation slides. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom Bell, who will begin on Slide 4. Thomas Bell : Thank you, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. It's very good to be with you again today. And I'm thrilled to report a very robust start for Leidos in 2024, a substantial raise to our full year guidance and some additional details around the purposeful steps we're taking to position Leidos for an awesome future. The Leidos team got out of the starting blocks impressively this year, addressing our customers' most vexing challenges with passion and pace, and as a result, delivering an excellent quarter of top and bottom line results. First quarter revenue grew 7.5% year-over-year, all organically. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.3%, a record for Leidos. And year-over-year non-GAAP EPS grew 56%. These results demonstrate that our new capability-based organization is unlocking significant value across the company. With good cash generation, as promised, we began our 2024 stock buyback program by repurchasing $150 million worth of shares on the open market during the quarter. You'll remember that during our last earnings call, I framed our initial 2024 guidance against the backdrop of a very good year for Leidos in 2023 and a very uncertain 2024 customer budget environment. Happily, since then, the House and Senate have passed appropriations for all the federal government. And now with funding in place, our customers have the resources and direction they need to confidently execute their missions. With that certainty in our customers' budget, the quick success of our organizational realignment and our team's strong start to the year, we have increased confidence in our near-term growth prospects. As such, we are significantly increasing our 2024 guidance and now expect to far exceed our previous multi-year financial commitments. Chris will detail our new 2024 guidance later in the call. As I round out my first year at the helm of Leidos, I remain impressed with the capability of our people to deliver for our customers and shareholders. Over the last 4 quarters, revenue has grown 8% and non-GAAP EPS has grown 25%. We've delivered adjusted EBITDA margins of 11.5% and free cash flow conversion of 109%. And we've maintained rigorous investments in IRAD and business development. I'm very pleased that we've been able to refine the conversation about what's possible here at Leidos, especially around profitability. Leidos is indeed a healthy business. So for the remainder of my prepared remarks, I'd like to share some additional details about the purposeful steps we are taking to position Leidos for an awesome future. We are achieving and propelling superior profitable growth by focusing on 3 key elements : first, continuing to unlock full value and flawless execution in our new capabilities-focused organization; second, increasing investment in distinct organic disruptive technologies; and third, developing a robust value-creating, merit-based Leidos' profit and growth strategy. Let me walk through each of these elements with you. First, we're very happy with the quick wins we're achieving from our capability-based organizational realignment. And we're anticipating that this move will continue to unlock significant value going forward. For example, by consolidating our commercial and international business into a single segment for the first time, we're now better able to truly serve our global customers. In February, I had the opportunity to attend the Munich Security Conference. It was a sobering affair, which made abundantly clear that pervasive global threats are, in fact, growing and our collective efforts to help our allies and partners are becoming even more crucial. To give you an idea of where and how the new Leidos can help, global battlefields of the future demand ever more custom interoperability and leading-edge technical solutions. As we collaborate with our customers and allies around the world, we gain valuable insights into their interconnected issues across borders. Our realignment which integrates all our international customer touch points into one organization enables us to better correlate and quickly respond with a whole of Leidos' solution to their critical emerging needs. Also, globally, the AUKUS Trilateral Security partnership represents a unique opportunity for Leidos as Australia, the U.K. and the U.S. seek to work even more closely together. The focus of AUKUS Pillar 2 is seamless information sharing, AI and autonomy, advanced cyber, hypersonics, and electronic warfare. This list reads like a catalog of Leidos' strength. We believe Leidos through our new Commercial International segment is uniquely positioned to serve these ambitions like no other. Second, we will continue to accelerate investment in distinct organic disruptive technologies. On my first earnings call, I highlighted technology innovation as a core of Leidos. Nearly a year into this role, I can confidently reaffirm that the technology prowess at Leidos is impressive, broad and deep. Continually sharpening our portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, what I call golden bolts, to lead turn the market or remain foundational to our North Star. At Leidos, innovation is everywhere, but we have a particular passion and focus on remaining best-in-class in free technologies, Trusted Mission AI, full-spectrum cyber, and secure rapid software. In each, we maintain a robust IRAD pipeline in what we call accelerators, staffed with incredibly smart people who work across the entire customer solution set. And we combine the resulting immense organic technical prowess with a best-in-class commercial partnership program to truly bring Making Smart Smarter to life. Let's talk about one of these accelerators. Trusted Mission AI spans the breadth of our portfolio and is integral in practically all our customer solutions. Our Trusted Mission AI solutions work as a partner to humans in transforming the way we deliver high-quality, rapid and secure outcomes for our customers' most complex missions. For example, across the intelligence community, we have several large classified contracts where we're leveraging Trusted Mission AI to exploit vast amounts of data to address ever-changing national security challenges. In the cyber realm, our team of experts has spent the last 3 years developing the next generation of defensive cyber tools. These tools use AI to automate the discovery of new vulnerabilities and the development of novel defenses. This unique solution allows us to proactively deploy defenses before attacks occur. Crucial in foreseeing, averting and defeating cyber risks. In Defense Systems, Trusted Mission AI is the enabling technology that anchors all our autonomy work. We've built the first generation of autonomous vessels for the U.S. Navy, several of which recently transited the Pacific twice as part of a manned, unmanned task force, and we're now applying this proven Trusted Mission AI technology to the next generation of unmanned surface vessels. In software and IT, we're leveraging our exclusive relationships with key emerging technology providers to bring the best of the latest generation of Generative AI to our customers. This enables us to uniquely position our customers to operate more efficiently, delivering real quantifiable impact. Let me share a couple of examples here. Our partnership with Sourcegraph leverages their commercial cutting-edge, GenAI coding assistant to transform the way we develop software. In just a few months, by combining our unparalleled government customer knowledge with their tools' power, we've proven productivity increases in software development of 1/3. And we know these solutions are deployable even into the most secure customer environments. Our exclusive partnership with Moveworks gives us a differentiated ability to bring our customers the best in GenAI-based IT service desk solutions. We've already deployed their technology within the Leidos IT environment and have completely automated processing of thousands of service requests. Our focus on integrating Trusted Mission AI into our customer solutions rather than just selling AI labor positions us uniquely to meet the growing demand for AI solutions across our customers. I trust these examples begin to give you a sense of our leadership position in all our golden bolts, but especially Trusted Mission AI. But if you'd like to see more of our solutions in action and meet some of our wicked smart people, I invite you to an Investors event, we will be hosting here at our global headquarters in Reston on 12 June. Finally, I'd like to give you an update on the development of our strategy for Leidos' second decade of growth. As I mentioned during our last call, this is a year of deep formally structured strategic conversations across the whole of the business. And while this effort will not be complete until early next year, I did want to share with you now some high-level principles that are guiding our work. Principles of our upcoming strategy will be doubling down on our core strengths, seeking to exploit the power of repeatable business models, making speed a conscious competitive discriminator, differentially investing in the areas of greatest potential, building Trusted Mission AI into everything we do, and uncovering unique opportunities to expand Leidos into logical, closely adjacent growth markets. These guiding principles will enable us to stay true to what we do best. While being quick to respond to the opportunities that are emerging at pace in our market. Also of note, importantly, as we think about our strategy, we will continue to view our balance sheet and cash generation capacity as key strategic assets. I remain committed to a disciplined capital management and deployment policy continuing a focus on shareholder returns in the near term. In closing, we're off to a great start this fiscal year. We are committed to building on our successes and deliver smarter outcomes for our customers, shareholders and each other. As we continue to push the boundaries and challenge ourselves to think bigger, I am confident that 2024 will be Leidos' best year so far. We'll see tremendous achievements and a crystallizing compelling growth strategy. With that, I'll pass the call to Chris to discuss our financial results for the first quarter and our financial promises to you for the full year. Chris? Chris Cage : Thanks, Tom, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. The first quarter operating in our new organization was a great one, far surpassing our initial expectations. While Health and Civil was a standout, each segment's relentless focus on innovation and operational efficiency led to above-plan performance in revenue, profit and cash in every reporting segment. Putting these results into the context of the full year, we are well on track to deliver an exceptional year of top and bottom line performance. Turning to the income statement on Slide 5. Revenues for the first quarter were $3.98 billion, up 7.5% year-over-year. With appropriations in place, our teams are working with their customers to execute on vital missions. Strong top line growth in the first quarter enabled us to achieve record profitability. Adjusted EBITDA was $490 million for the quarter, up 42% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 290 basis points to 12.3%. Non-GAAP net income was $313 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.29, up 53% and 56%, respectively. This explosive earnings' growth was the result of core operating performance. The net impact of a slightly lower net interest expense and share count was wholly offset by a slightly higher tax rate compared to the prior year period. This bottom line performance not only boosted our cash flows, but have put us in a favorable position to continue reinvesting across the business to support the execution of our longer-term strategic objectives. Turning to the segment drivers on Slide 6. National Security and Digital revenues increased 2% year-over-year. The largest growth catalysts were increased volumes on the Sentinel and DES programs, which more than offset the focused box loss early in 2023. National Security and Digital non-GAAP operating income margin increased 120 basis points from the prior year quarter to 10.1% with some milestone achievements, strong cost control and excellent program execution. Health and Civil revenues increased 19% over the prior year quarter and non-GAAP operating income margin also came in at 19%, up from 12.2% a year ago. The primary driver of revenue growth and increased profitability was higher volumes across our managed health services portfolio. We entered the year with tempered expectations around medical exam volumes but we're seeing increased complexity on PACT Act cases. And although we're investing heavily to drive throughput, the team did an amazing job at improving efficiency, optimizing resources and delivering exceptional service to the nation's active duty members, reservers and veterans. Commercial and international revenues increased 4%, and non-GAAP operating income margin was 8.3% up 360 basis points compared to the prior year. We had increased deliveries of security products, and we're seeing the impact of the changes we made in the SES business including a leaner cost structure, improved supply chain and rationalize product and geographic portfolio. Though our work is not done in fully optimizing the security products business, I'm proud of the team for their performance and recovery since this time last year. Finally, Defense Systems revenue increased 7% year-over-year with increased volumes in our airborne ISR and hypersonics businesses. Defense Systems non-GAAP operating margins of 8% declined 170 basis points over the prior year quarter but were up 30 basis points sequentially and we remain committed to margin improvement for this segment for the full year. Turning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 7. We generated $63 million of cash flow from operating activities and $46 million of free cash flow. DSO for the quarter was 62 days, unchanged from a year ago. In Q1, we repurchased a net of $170 million worth of shares including $150 million on the open market and paid $53 million in dividends. We ended the quarter with $633 million in cash and cash equivalents and $4.7 billion of debt. Our gross leverage ratio now goes at 2.6x, comfortably below our 3x target. On to the forward outlook on Slide 8. As we look ahead to the rest of the fiscal year 2024, we are poised to capitalize on the momentum we've been building. Based on our strong Q1 and improved outlook, we are raising our 2024 guidance for all metrics. We now expect revenue between $16 billion and $16.4 billion, an increase of $300 million to the range. Our new adjusted EBITDA margin range is mid- to high 11%, which would be record profitability for a full fiscal year. With an improving revenue and margin outlook, we're raising our non-GAAP diluted EPS by $0.90 to a new range of $8.40 to $8.80. And finally, we're raising our operating cash flow target by $200 million to approximately $1.3 billion for the year. Underpinning this updated guidance is a positive outlook on business development. In the first quarter, we booked a net of $3.7 billion, which translated to a book-to-bill of 0.9x for the quarter, and 1.1x for a trailing 12 months. The quarterly bookings total excludes a multibillion-dollar classified award that is currently under protest, and a $630 million Defense Systems award received on April 1, both of which are new work for Leidos. We're seeing positive business development momentum and we expect our awards this year to support our growth objectives. Finally, let me give you some sector-specific movements that color our full year guidance. On the fourth quarter call, we highlighted that Health and Civil had the potential to outperform if medical examination volumes remain high. Since then, volumes have actually increased given the complexity of PACT Act cases. The second quarter should see similar levels of performance or even a little better. However, as a result of the increased volumes, the VBA has burned through some of its contracts sooner than planned, and we'll have to recompete them early. We are well positioned to continue our best-in-class service as a long-standing trusted mission partner to the VA, but we are planning for performance in the Health and Civil segment to moderate in the back half of the year through the competitive process. First quarter revenue growth in the Defense Systems and Commercial International segments was more robust than anticipated. Although we see some potential for growth in both segments, we still see the full year revenue performance as relatively flat. In Commercial and International, some of the SES geographies and products we exited will begin to weigh on revenue. And Defense Systems is still working to mature some of its developmental programs. Taken together, with funding certainty, positive demand signals and the performance seen across all 4 segments this quarter, we feel confident in our ability to deliver within these new ranges. With that, operator, we're ready to take some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bert Subin with Stifel. Bert Subin : Tom, when you started, I guess, about a year ago, you said you wanted to evaluate allocation of capital to each business based on the business case supporting the return on capital for each. It would seem like capital is being put to best use right now in Health and Civil. Is that a near-term phenomenon being driven by the PACT Act? Or is there a case for that business to be your fastest growing and most profitable longer term as well? Thomas Bell : I did say that, and I do believe in a merit-based strategy process. I mentioned that in my prepared remarks because what we are doing in 2024 as we undertake this year of deep strategic thinking is analyzing all the business cases and the sub business cases for where the best use of capital is to draw a superior top line and bottom line growth for Leidos. And so as a result, we're able to put some seed corn in areas that are emerging in this year, even though the strategy process is not done. And yes, in fact, the investments we've made in our managed health care business is absolutely paying dividends now, and that is the reason that business under Leidos' leadership has been so well positioned to respond to the increased demands that have come our way. So we're very excited about the strategy process we've got underway. We're very excited about the ideas that are emerging from that strategy process. And we're seeing great benefit of past decisions we made through last year about where to invest, how to invest and which businesses to position for future growth. Chris, did you want to add anything to that? Chris Cage : I just -- obviously, the Health and Civil organization has been a standout, and we do see that momentum continuing. And to Tom's point, it's been a multiyear investment strategy that's positioned us to be where we are and to deliver excellent results for our veterans and be rewarded for that. But there are other parts of the portfolio we're very excited about, too. And so I wouldn't limit our thinking and our investments to solely focus on Health and Civil. And at the same time, some of the Health and Civil organization results have benefited from investments we've made in things like AI and other capabilities at the center that apply broadly. So you'll see those strategies continue, and you'll see us continue to accelerate those investments as the year unfolds. Bert Subin : That's great. And Tom, you spent -- and Chris, you just mentioned it there. You spent several minutes in your prepared remarks talking about AI. I think one of your peers gets a lot of credit for sort of being the leader in the industry on AI and has taken some steps to break out like what their sales are and how it impacts their win rate on certain contracts. It seems like you're pretty confident in what you're doing there. And it would seem like it's helped quite a bit in your Health business with the VA. Are there some examples? Or are there some sort of numbers you can give us related to AI just to sort of think better about your positioning as we go forward? Thomas Bell : Well, thanks, Bert. Yes. And yes, the fun thing about capitalism is many people look at the same market and decide to prosecute it in different ways. We're aware that our competitors are looking at selling AI labor and think it's a market unto itself. That's not how we see the world. We see the world as difficult customer challenges, and we see ourselves as solution providers into that space. We see Trusted Mission AI as a huge key enabler to unlocking superior value for our customers and the solutions we bring forward. So we're going to continue to avoid breaking AI out as a specific target. But in the spirit of your questions, I can share with you some antidotal evidence. For instance, while we've been investing in AI, the deployment of that has enabled us to improve quality on about $1 billion of those health exams. In other words, some of the throughput we've been able to have in our clinics is the direct result of the efficiency that the AI tools we have embedded in our solutions unlocks. We've been able to put AI in our SES airport security business by linking things together there. We've been able to put AI in our unmanned systems, command and control systems that will enable us to help unmanned systems quickly speak to each other and aggregate their effects. So we're going to continue to see Trusted Mission AI as not an end but a means to serving customer missions. And I hope that differentiation is something that you can join us on the 12th of June to understand even more. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities. Jasper Bibb : This is Jasper Bibb on for Tobey. I think last call, you talked about the initial mid- to high 10% guidance range on margin as a base sustainably grow off. And then you raised the '24 guides significantly this quarter. So I guess looking forward, how are you thinking about progression on margins given the progress you've already made this year? Chris Cage : Yes, Jasper, thanks for that, right. Obviously, we're very pleased with the start to the year. And as in our prepared remarks, we indicated it wasn't just the Health and Civil business. It was really all of our teams got out of the gate strong. And so now our full year outlook has been updated to mid- to high 11%. We think that's an area that, obviously, we're ahead of that in Q1, but that will be strong performance across the business as the year unfolds. And you think about some parts of the portfolio, for example, Commercial International and Defense Systems, both of which had good first quarters, but aren't yet where we expect that they will be on a margin performance basis. So there's uplift there over the course of this year and into the future. And for Health and Civil, sustained this level of performance through Q2 is what we indicated, and we'll have to see how the competitive process plays out on the recompetes in Q3, Q4, but there is the potential for that business to continue this momentum, certainly through the back half of this year and into '25. Thomas Bell : Just pivoting off of that a little bit, I want to give a shout-out to the team for how they've embraced this whole concept of promises-made, promises-kept culture. So while we have a standout first quarter performance in our Health business, they are not the only business committed to continuing to perform through the year.  So we're very confident in our ability to hit the current range, and we're very excited about the degrees of freedom that gives us to invest differentially in our future and really propel our next growth strategy to great heights. Jasper Bibb : That makes sense. And then you mentioned the improvement in managed health programs for Health and Civil segment this quarter. I guess just curious what the trends were on the legacy Civil side of the segment as part of the growth in margins Leidos had driven in the first quarter. Chris Cage : Yes. The Civil part of the portfolio has some excellent programs in there. And as Leidos and the team are bringing that all together, it's more about the energy and the synergies that we see across those businesses on personnel and in software capabilities that can be extended to both sides of the equation. I wouldn't think there's any particular standouts in the Civil portfolio. It was a solid first quarter out of the gate.  So we're looking forward to building on that momentum as the year unfolds, especially -- and as we look at our FAA business and where that can extend capabilities to certain international customers, et cetera, as a particular area of interest for us. Thomas Bell : But I can't let that question not go without a little bit of a foot stomp on the great performance we're having in the Health side of the business. We are continuing to invest in innovation there. And some of the innovations that Bert asked us about before that were built during the COVID crisis puts us in this position to do exams better for the VBA and some of the results that are behind the financial results are that Leidos investments have allowed us to increase the total number of veterans served by 27% in 2023.  And as Chris mentioned in his comments, the volume is even increasing now in 2024. More than just that, we're able to serve our rural veterans better by 33%, and we're able to serve our homebound veterans by over 55%.  So the investments we've made in technology and capability to take the clinics to the veterans are serving our veterans in ways that are enabling us to then unlock volume and unlock financial results. We're very excited not only about the whole of Leidos' portfolio, but this part of the portfolio in particular. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Sheila  Kahyaoglu: Kudos to the Leidos Board for choosing the right candidate, clearly, Tom, great results, the whole Leidos team. So maybe on Health, we talked about it a little bit and Chris mentioned it in his remarks in terms of the PACT Act moderation. Can you maybe frame how we should think about the upside and downside scenarios there? Thomas Bell : Yes. So the PACT Act volumes are racing forward. We're in a unique position to liquidate that volume on behalf of the Veterans Administration and feel very good about that. But as Chris mentioned in his comments, that puts pressure on reaching the contract ceiling value for the Veterans Administration, and they may have to -- and they will have to recompete that contract early. However, we've got a great position for that recompete.  We feel very confident in the technology, the capabilities and the team we have assembled to continue to serve veterans in this nation. And so while, as Chris said in his comments, we've provisioned for some slight moderation in profitability in the second half of the year just because of the competitive dynamics and our being unsure of exactly how the Veterans Administration is going to put that RFP out. We feel very good that, that's a business we're in. That's a business we can continue to grow and that's a business that we can continue to serve our nation and its veterans very robustly. Chris? Chris Cage : Yes, Sheila, I'd just add, I mean, we have invested. We'll continue to invest in increasing our ability to drive throughput and drive excellent service for the veterans. We've gotten the strongest signal yet from the customer that the volume of activity should remain elevated, and we see that continuing into 2025. And it's not just the number of cases, it's the complexity of those cases.  So we're, we believe, still in the early innings of where this thing can play out, and we're going to continue to invest accordingly to make sure veterans are well served with great experiences. I would say that even our first quarter results, which were quite strong, it wasn't aided by incentive fees as part of that, too. So there's still some opportunities to drive that performance higher over time. So I really like how we're positioned in that business right now. Sheila  Kahyaoglu: And then maybe on Defense Systems margins, they were better sequentially but down 170 bps year-on-year. So how do we think about maybe just focusing on Dynetics, the key milestones there in terms of improvement in profitability? Chris Cage : Yes. So I mean, a couple of things we're tracking, and Cindy, leading that business is all over this with her team. But as we said in our remarks, we're actually pleased with the way we performed out of the gates in the first quarter. We're ahead of pace. There are some specific things we're focused on to drive margins higher over time, one of which we just completed at the end of last year, getting Dynetics fully integrated into the Leidos set of systems, whether that's financial, HR, et cetera, and our rate structure. And so there's a lot more collaboration, resource sharing, efficiencies that are unlocked as part of that.  So that's very exciting program execution. It's a strength of Leidos, and it's an area that we've seen improvements in talent upgrades and process upgrades, and that's an area that we can identify mile markers along the rest of this year that will drive our program performance higher and our profitability higher as the year unfolds.  And then finally, transitioning into next phase of key programs. We know sometimes on developmental programs, the early phases are not the most profitable, lessons are learned, and those are applied into the next round of bidding. And I think the team has incorporated those and we feel good about the bids we've been putting out and they are well positioned to win to keep growing that business. Thomas Bell : Yes. And just to foot stomp that a little bit, Sheila. I mentioned -- as I foot-stomped an earlier comment about all the businesses keeping up with their commitments to Chris and I for their full year performance and the promises-made, promises-kept modus operandi, and I'm very happy to report that Cindy is amongst them, undeterred by a less robust start to the year than perhaps we might have hoped for, but very committed to the full year results, and she and her team are committed to meeting or exceeding those. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Rocco J Barbero : This is Rocco for Seth. On margins, milestone achievements supported the National Security and Digital margin in the quarter. Should we expect additional milestones in the coming quarters? Or should the margin rate there normalize? And then on Health and Civil, Q2 is expected to be as stronger as Q1, but should we think about the back half falling into the mid-teens on margins [ seen as strongest ] in the business, obviously, pending the recompete? Chris Cage : Yes, I'll start and Tom can jump on. Obviously, National Security and Digital, excellent program execution is what we expect from that team because they've consistently delivered it. And sometimes you're not able to anticipate that you'll knock it out of park on award fees the way they have continued to do so, but I wouldn't bet against them.  So we'll continue to see program execution as a strength there. And as it relates to Health, yes, when we -- Health and Civil, when we started the year, we signaled there in the mid-teens was a reasonable expectation for the year. We've exceeded that. We'll continue to exceed that level through Q2. And I think even in the second half of the year, there's the possibility and potential, it could be better than that, and we'll be able to give you some better color on that as we get closer to the recompete process. Thomas Bell : I would just say that my whole promises-made, promises-kept culture, never uninvites overperformance. And so overperformance is welcomed. Overperformance is understood as a goal we all look to achieve and I have every confidence, Roy and his team are going to work to overperform both in this year and the future. We haven't talked about it yet, but our business development pipeline is very exciting and very robust. And nowhere is it more robust and more exciting than in Roy's business, in our National Security and Digital space. So he and Steve are working very hard to make sure we are positioned to win in the marketplace in the future, not only to deliver results now but to deliver results for the next 5 years. Rocco J Barbero : Great. And then should we expect hypersonics to drive Defense Systems growth this year or when the business is changing to limit growth? Thomas Bell : Well, hypersonics is one of several areas that we're focused on in our Defense Systems business. And yes, we are very excited about the capabilities we've proven in our hypersonics programs. And in fact, this week, we're having very robust conversations with customers around where they want to go and how they want to take that technology forward.  Obviously, it's a wicked hard problem, but we've got our wicked smart people working to solve them with and for the customers. But that's not the only one. We've obviously got a lot of expectation with regard to IFPC Enduring Shield. That program is progressing well through the Army test program this year, and we're very hopeful for an LRIP decision at the end of this year. And wide field of view Tranche 2, while we were disappointed that the prime for our payload wasn't selected, we're working several avenues to maintain our prowess in that market and serve our nation in their understanding of what's happening from a threat standpoint.  So our Defense business isn't only hypersonics, but hypersonics is one of those areas, and we're very excited about the suite of capabilities we're currently focused on, necking down to and prosecuting effectively. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Matthew Akers : I wonder if you could comment on the security products business. I think you said in the prepared remarks, there's still work to be done optimizing that. So I was just curious if you could touch on -- I think you are in-sourcing some products you talked about that last year. And then kind of how big should we think about some of these products that you've decided to exit? Thomas Bell : We are very, very proud of Vicki and her team and the swift actions they've taken through last year and since last year. They're engaged, they're excited about the opportunities they see. And I'm very happy that they're not looking at that world through rose-colored glasses. They are being positively inclined pragmatists, looking at the market for what it is and looking at how we prosecute that market in the Leidos way to the best degree possible. We did exit certain geographies, as we talked about last year, and we continued to refine the products we're actually offering into the marketplace because we decided those have become commoditized and they weren't a great place for Leidos to perform. But while it's still early innings, we're very excited about the business. We're spending a lot of time on the strategy for how and where we grow that business into the future. And we expect that to be a part of our conversation as the strategy unfolds through the year and into next. Chris, anything you'd add? Chris Cage : And I would just add, I mean, we're excited about getting our Charleston facility up and running. And the teams have been doing a good job there. Actually, the leadership team will be down there next week to lay eyes on it ourselves.  So we're looking forward to seeing that. There's a variety of products. I won't get into specifics about which ones we're pulling out of the portfolio. But clearly, we're focused on where we have technical differentiation, leadership positions, people screening has been a strength of that business for a long time. You can imagine that will be something we continue to stick with and double down on.  We have excellent suite of port and borders equipment, but there are some pockets of the check baggage -- checkpoint baggage, et cetera, that we just have to continue to evaluate where we're positioned and make those changes accordingly. Matthew Akers : Great. And then I also want to ask on CapEx. A little bit of a slow start to the year. I might have missed it, but is the $190 million still the right way to think about that for this year? And does that sort of ramp up the year? Chris Cage : Yes, Matt, that's still our budget, and there's a little bit of reserve in there. And we ask the teams to be smart and disciplined even when we allocate them approvals. But you'll see a few things ramp up. We've got our San Diego facility that we're going to be proud of to get a brand-new facility for a lot of our classified work out in San Diego completed this summer, and the teams are also looking for interesting ways that we can get in front of the customer on unmanned capabilities, demos, tests, et cetera. So we expect that to ramp up a little bit, but we'll continue to manage that tightly. Thomas Bell : Chris mentioned San Diego a little bit. I'll just foot-stomp the great job the team is doing there. We're building a facility that will be world-class in terms of security and up to the latest standards of our nation. And so we'll have facilities on the West Coast that are as good as any and better than most. And we're very excited about the conversations and the opportunities that will unlock for us with our customers and the opportunity, therefore, to serve them at the highest classification levels. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Noah Poponak : So I guess on the margins, in the quarter, the total company EBITDA margin over 12% despite what you're saying about Defense Systems and the back half of last year kind of mid-11s with the same thing and a little bit more normal Health margin. I guess just without even putting a time frame on it, but just as you go forward beyond this year, should we all be thinking of Leidos as a 12% plus EBITDA margin business? Or is that getting ahead of ourselves, depending on where Health and Civil shake out? Thomas Bell : Well, no, we're not in the point where we're guiding to 2025 and beyond. But I remember last year, when we were wrapping up the year, we were talking about us being high-10s business and people were chastising me for suggesting we might be over 11%. Now we're proving we can be over 11% and very eager to see what the full potential of this business is. That's not a commitment to maintain margins at a certain level. We're going to make smart decisions. We're not going to get locked into certain preconceived notions of where we want to go, but better is always good. And we want to bank those gains and expand and exploit other areas to grow the business. So as we've guided this year, high 11s is our commitment to you in 2024. And as we prosecute 2025, we'll be very eager to see if we can meet or better that. Chris, anything? Chris Cage : Well, mid- to high 11s. Tom, I just want to make sure the team doesn't run away from us here on their models. But no, your points are well made. I think that we have lines of business that haven't reached their full potential, and we're driving them in that direction.  And capitalizing on the gains we made, we're going to continue to invest to stay ahead of demand. So those are things that we'll have to evaluate where those opportunities are, Noah. But clearly, you can see this business has a lot of potential, and we're going to continue to unlock it. Noah Poponak : Okay. And Tom, you sound pretty positive on bid and proposal. It sounds like you're making changes there as well. The company has had a lot of growth in the all-in total backlog number. It's been kind of flatter on that funded number and the funded book-to-bill or your stated book-to-bill, it's been decent, but it's seen higher numbers in the past, I guess. Are you expecting or should we be expecting that -- those numbers to improve through this year? Or does it take you a little more time to make any changes you're making on the BNP side? Thomas Bell : And yes, we've put the right team in place to execute the vision for us being a growing business profitably, focused on profitable growth. And so the pipeline is being refined to go after aggressively the right business, not all business. You remember one of my sayings, not all business is good business. And for Leidos, people understand that message and our priming the pump of the pipeline accordingly. We've got a healthy backlog, as you rightly call out, I'm not a big fan of these quarterly book-to-bill ratios because they are a fool's mission. The right thing to do is focus on a health backlog, a profitable growth. And we're not embarrassed by the backlog we've got. It's up 4% year-over-year. And we're looking to improve that as the year goes on. We've got a huge pipeline of opportunities in front of us. All businesses have robust pipelines of good growth. And yes, in the latter half of this year, there are a significant number of new and takeaway businesses that we're hoping to brag about on future calls. But we've got to wait and see on those things. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. Cai Von Rumohr : Tom, good work on medical exams, terrific numbers. So you mentioned that you're approaching the ceiling on the medical exam. Can you tell us approximately when you might hit that ceiling? And can you give us any range of time frame in terms of when we might expect a new RFP? Chris Cage : Cai, this is Chris. Again, the team has done great work, and we're proud to serve our veterans, and it's been volumes that the customer didn't see coming when the original contracts were put in place. So the ceiling is structured differently. It's based upon an exam volume, and they've actually had to issue a justification authorization to extend that once already to give them time to run this competitive process.  We believe that process should play out over the next couple of quarters and culminate by the end of government fiscal year if things stay on track, that's the time line we're working towards. Obviously, it's not entirely within our control but our expectation is we'd have that new contractual vehicle in place beginning of our fourth quarter. Thomas Bell : Obviously, Cai, you'll appreciate the fact that our nation can afford the gap is critical capability for those who have served us. And so we are very appreciative that the Veterans Administration is working with alacrity around the whole of the system and how they keep serving our veterans adequately. And we're very much in dialogue with them to make sure that we're positioned to make sure our veterans continue to be served. Cai Von Rumohr : Got it. And so you've done way better than most of the other services business. Is there any risk or thought that because you're doing so well that the next bids might be structured so that there's not the same profit opportunity because obviously, I would assume, this has got to attract lots and lots of bidders. Or do you have any visibility at all or thought about how the VA might structure the next RFP? Thomas Bell : I think the long and short answer to that, Cai, is no, we don't yet. They're still working through that themselves. But we feel very confident in the investments we've made and the facilitation that we've done, the technology we've deployed, the team we've assembled that we're in a very good place to compete and continue to serve our nation and the Veterans Administration. Exactly what the rules are and what the incentives are in the next RFP will be known in time. But whatever the customer decides to do, we'll adjust accordingly and continue to work to make an adequate return on our investment and adequately serve our nation's veterans.  So we're not deterred by this. We're actually excited. The fact is we are making robust profits here because we're serving our veterans so effectively. We're doing exactly what the Veterans Administration has incentivized us to do. And so it's a good news story. And the veterans who get served, the quality health care they get coming into a Leidos QTC clinic is better than any. And the customer service and the customer reputation we have is best-in-class. So we're very excited about it and very eager to continue to serve our nation in this way. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Robert Spingarn : So Tom, I wanted to start with a big-picture question, and it's about AI, you talked about it earlier. This is a little bit more from the industry perspective, but you and your competitors generate 60% or more of your sales from cost plus and time and materials contracts.  And I'm wondering if the work of consultants can be automated or done more efficiently through AI, might that presumably lead to lower costs and reduced billable hours. And in that case, how does the value accrue to shareholders rather than all of that efficiency just being passed back to the customer? Thomas Bell : Rob, what we're looking at with AI, and I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, is really becoming that conduit from commercial best practices and GenAI technologies into the government space. You'll appreciate as well as anybody the fact that the government space and the government systems have a whole bunch of idiosyncrasies and complications that people like Leidos and Leidos in particular, know very well.  So the 2 examples I cited in my prepared remarks of Sourcegraph and Moveworks are 2 examples of best-in-class commercial capabilities that we're being able to use to generate outsized productive results for our customers. What that does is it does cut down work in the customer ecosystem but it allows the people to go do more value-added work than just the trite, routine, repetitive or deeply analytical things that then we team with a human. We're very focused on integrating those solutions into our Trusted Mission AI solutions.  And then we're very keen that we don't deploy AI and forget. We are very focused on our AI solutions being in partnership with the human being, never alone and unafraid. Chris, anything you'd like to add? Chris Cage : Rob, it's a good question. It's a good insight. I think we take the view that you've got to play the long game here. I mean if we were worried about maximizing the dollar on the current book of cost-plus contracts, I think that'd be a little bit shortsighted. So recognizing that, to Tom's point, we can deliver more mission outcome with the same budget and then set ourselves up to be incrementally more competitive on future opportunities. That's what's going to play well with our customers, and that's what's going to keep them coming back to Leidos. So we see this perpetuating our growth momentum as we continue to invest in this capability. Robert Spingarn : And that's a real interesting answer. And then, Chris, just not so much following on to that, but talking about cost plus, again, I think if we look at the other side of that, I think, around 40% of revenues are fixed price. So a pretty meaningful portion. I'm wondering, I want to ask you about stale backlog. If the backlog reflects that 40%, in other words, it's similar to the revenue profile. Is there any portion of that, that has pre-inflation pricing where you'd get a natural lift in margins as that work rolls off over the next couple of years and things are repriced post-inflation? Chris Cage : Rob, on inflation, I get where you're going with that. And I mean there's -- I'd say there's pockets of that, but there's not a pervasive opportunity or concern in our current backlog. I mean a lot of it as we priced our backlog on multiyear jobs, even if it's fixed price, we built in some inflationary expectation.  Some of that, for a period of time, inflation ran hot. But the teams have flexibility on how they execute for those outcomes. And so we're also motivated to drive efficiencies in our process. And each new bid that we're moving forward with, we're evaluating them on their own merits and looking for opportunities to make sure they can generate an attractive return for our shareholders. So feel good about our backlog and feel good about our pipeline and where that helps support our margin objectives over time. Stuart Davis : Operator, it looks like we only have time for one more question. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Jason Gursky : Tom, you mentioned during the quarter and then here again on the call today, the Munich Security Conference and the somber event that it was. I'm just curious from a demand perspective coming out of Europe, kind of what you at Leidos are seeing these days. And how do you go about taking advantage of the demand signals that you're seeing in Europe at this point kind of given where you operate on that side of the pond, so to speak? And what kinds of programs you might be chasing over there? Thomas Bell : Yes, it was a somber sobering affair. For those of you who haven't picked up the magazine that they published at the beginning, the title of the conference was lose-lose question mark. So that gives you a sense of the tone earlier this year. And I don't think that, that has become any more joyful.  They are all to a, one, increasing defense budgets robustly. So there is certainly top line growth happening in Europe. But more importantly than that, my personal hypothesis is that we're going to see defense expenditures globally, morphed from hardware to more system solutions and effectors.  I beg your pardon for those words, but systems, integrated solutions and effectors, not so much the platform that launches the product, but the actual effector for defense. And so Leidos is particularly well positioned to serve that market, not only because we've got a robust presence in Europe already anchored in the U.K., but throughout Europe.  But also because as I look at that shift in spend, not only the increase in top line, but the shift to product services and solutions and effectors -- from products to solutions, services and effectors. I see Leidos in the unique opportunity to help our customers prosecute those needs. I mentioned in AUKUS, what AUKUS Pillar 2 is all about, seamless information sharing, AI, autonomy, advanced cyber, hypersonics, electronic warfare. And I mentioned -- I mean this reads like a catalog of Leidos' capabilities and strengths.  So I think we are uniquely positioned. The fact that the U.S. is talking about lowering the ITAR hurdles between the U.S. and the U.K. as a part of all of this allows us to position ourselves even more forcefully to serve our U.K. customers in ways we have been inhibited from doing before. And I think that gives us a launching off point to talk to the Baltics around undersea capabilities, to talk to all about integrated air defense capabilities, to talk to all about electronic warfare capabilities. It just gives us the launching point to have much more robust conversations than we've been able to have before. And again, our Commercial and International segment now all aligned to have all those customer touch points aggregated into one place, so we can more jointly connect them and prosecute them with a whole of Leidos' approach.  I just really think is an exciting time for Leidos. So early days. They're still doing a little storming and norming about those budgets and how they're going to do it. But we are not going to be haughty and say it's all got to be us. We also are humble partners in these things. So we're working to find out who we might want to partner with in Europe to prosecute these even better and work with national champions as a result. So it's a very exciting opportunity, but early days yet. Jason Gursky : And then just the last one on the pipeline that you have in front of you here domestically, maybe you could just talk about what you're seeing from a competitive perspective here of late and just general trends on the competitive environment would be great. Thomas Bell : Yes. So we're doing reasonably well in defending the work we have. Our recompetes and on-contract growth is good, and we are very happy with our performance there. The retooling in our business capture and growth areas is all about going after the big game and making sure we put ourselves in a position to robustly prosecute new opportunities for Leidos.  I feel very good about the team we've got. I've got very -- the pipeline is actually stoped with those kind of takeaway opportunities, and there's many that are well over a billion. So we're seeing ample opportunities for Leidos to differentiate itself in competitions, and we're seeing ample customer uptake on the kind of things that Leidos does best. Chris, anything you'd like to add? Chris Cage : Yes, Jason, just quickly, I mean, I'd say that certainly, best value or decisions are the trend we continue to see. And I'm not seeing any Crazy Ivans and the competitive set is pretty well known and understood. We pay a lot of attention to that. Oftentimes, it just comes down to are you writing a compelling proposal, getting clarity of what your solution, and do you have the unparalleled customer understanding that you need to really hit the mark on the things that they're looking for that might not have jumped out in the RFI.  So we think we're doing that well. We think we're focused on adding talent and depth in our account management structure to continue to do that well, and we like where we're positioned. Operator : This concludes the Q&A portion. I'll now turn the call back over to Stuart Davis for closing remarks. Stuart Davis : Thank you, operator, for your assistance on this morning's call, and thank you all for your time this morning and your interest in Leidos. We look forward to updating you again soon. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. Please note, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll turn the conference over to Stuart Davis from Investor Relations. Stuart, you may begin. Stuart Davis : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our second quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Tom Bell, our CEO, and Chris Cage, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you'll also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll use during today's call. Turning to Slide 2 of the presentation, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, includes risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, as shown on Slide 3, during the call, we'll discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in today's press release and presentation slides. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom Bell, who will begin on Slide 4. Tom Bell : Thank you, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be with you all again today to report a record quarter for Leidos. In this quarter, organic growth remained strong, achieving a record adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.5%. Year-to-date, we've delivered industry-leading profitable growth, with adjusted diluted EPS 50% higher than last year. The team is doing an excellent job converting our earnings into cash. In turn, this has allowed us to continue to deploy capital to grow shareholder value per our plan. We're now halfway through our commitment to repurchase $500 million worth of shares this year. I'm also proud of the fact that this robust first half of 2024 allows us to once again raise guidance for the full year. Chris will give you a complete update on our financials and our guidance later in the call. One year ago, on my first call with you all, I laid out four focus areas to begin Leidos' journey to best-in-class performance. Instilling in Leidos a \"Promises Made, Promises Kept\" culture, sharpening our strategy, improving the performance of previous acquisitions, and enhancing our ability to win new business. I'd like to take this opportunity to update you on the meaningful progress we're making in these areas. I see this progress as foundational to putting ourselves in a great position to execute our forthcoming Leidos North Star strategy. First, our team has fully embraced a \"Promises Made, Promises Kept\" philosophy. As part of this, we've made a firm commitment to each other to drive operational improvement, profitable growth and robust cash conversion. The evidence of this culture taking hold is clearly visible in the 12-month trend of our results, and our second quarter results, summarized earlier, that are simply our best yet. Our currently strong and strengthening balance sheet puts us in an excellent position to continue to allocate capital prudently over time to grow shareholder value. Further share repurchases this year are possible, but at the same time, I must say that our new North Star strategy work is beginning to bring into focus exciting and compelling growth opportunities potentially worthy of investment. This brings me to that second focus area, creating our new North Star strategy. While we continue to deliver robust in-year program execution, we are also aggressively prosecuting our year of deep strategic thinking. And the energy and insights that are beginning to come into focus because of our purposeful strategy process are very intriguing. We've now completed work on the Leidos proprietary hypothesis of the future, our own exclusive prediction of the challenges our customers will face, the solutions those challenges will require, and the technologies we must create and harnessed to best differentiate our solutions for our customers. Informed by our hypothesis of the future, we're now halfway through crafting a new business strategy for Leidos. This strategy will both leverage and enhance our current core businesses and uniquely position us for outstanding success in the future we foresee. One clear component of our strategy will remain our focus on technical differentiators, our golden bolts. Technological innovation is and will remain a cornerstone of Leidos. And our enterprise-wide technology investments are now more than 1% of total revenue and growing. At our recent Investor Technology Day, we went in-depth on one of those golden bolts, Trusted Mission AI. Those of you who were able to join us witnessed firsthand our brilliant team in action, demonstrating how we use Trusted Mission AI to drive productive disruption across our customers' missions. We believe that when it comes to AI, the mission is the market. So, everything we do as the number one provider of IT to the federal government and the number eight US defense contractor is an opportunity to exploit and deploy Trusted Mission AI for our customers' mission benefit. Another area of proactive investment for us remains cybersecurity. For instance, we've been investing in Zero Trust for years before there was a requirement for it to be adopted by federal agencies. As a result, over the last three years, we've received more than $5 billion of awards that cite our Zero Trust methodology as a differentiated strength. We're currently pioneering the application of quantum technologies to enable highly secure networks. We're executing contract R&D for DARPA in this area and investing in post-quantum encryption technologies and solutions. These will ensure our customers can rapidly respond to future developments in quantum computing. These examples give you some understanding of our forward-looking approach to the market and our track record of investing ahead of demand. Third, we're on track to unlock the strategic value from the large acquisitions we made in 2020 and 2021, specifically Dynetics in security, detection and automation. On Dynetics, we have doubled down on three specific areas, each of these now on a robust positive trajectory. In satellite payloads, we're a key supplier to the Space Development Agency's wide-field-of-view sensor program within its proliferated warfighting space architecture. We have delivered all our payloads for Tranche 0, and those payloads were the first ones in low-earth orbit providing SDA actual on-orbit imagery. In addition, we remain on track to deliver our Tranche 1 payloads in early 2025. And we are teamed with Sierra Space to be their payload provider on their Tranche 2 birds. The Space Development Agency has recently issued their RFI for Tranche 3. So in sum, we believe our current comprehensive role on all three existing tranches and our current actual mission performance in space position us well to continue to deliver for this critical and expanding mission. On force protection, we've delivered 14 IFPC Enduring Shield prototypes, which are successfully working their way through government testing. The Army recognizes this system's unrivaled air defense capability, and we expect to receive awards soon to begin low-rate production in 2025 and full-rate production in 2026. And in hypersonics, the United States continues to progress in developing and fielding hypersonic weapons. Leidos is supporting this progress by developing -- excuse me, delivering technology advances through our Common-Hypersonic Glide Body and MACH-TB programs. These programs play a critical role in accelerating the pace and scale at which we can produce, test, assess, advance and field our nation's hypersonic capabilities. We remain on track for our Common-Hypersonic Glide Body and thermal protection systems delivery. And all in all, we feel quite positive about this robust pipeline of opportunities in hypersonics. So, 2024 maintains its promise to be the good year for the maturation of these programs. And we're also seeing our focus here translate into better financial performance. Our Defense Systems profitability was double-digits in the quarter, our first time at that level of performance from as far back as we recast financials in the new organizational structure. Turning to security products, the SD&A acquisition is now fully integrated into our SES business area. Though challenges remain, SES is on sound footing because of the swift actions of our new management team that they took last year. We have focused our efforts and investments in product lines and geographies that make the most sense for Leidos and therefore, our shareholders. Our new Charleston manufacturing facility is up and operational, and we're performing better against our service-level agreements with our customers. We've had solid bookings this year and more consistent deliveries of large border solutions. As a result, SES is ahead of plan for revenue and earnings for the quarter and the year. SES revenues are up 11% year-to-date and we've achieved almost 90% of last year's non-GAAP profit in the first two quarters of 2024 alone. A common theme of this improved acquisition performance is the new organizational structure, which brings better alignment of sector resources and new leadership with an increased emphasis on execution and Promises Made, Promises Kept. Fourth, we continue to make significant progress to enhance our business capture performance and backlog quality. We've achieved net bookings of $4 billion this quarter with a heavy emphasis on cyber and dig-mod awards for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0. We also have nearly $3 billion of awards currently under protest. We ended the quarter with total backlog of $36.5 billion, including $8 billion of funded backlog. While this quarter's performance adequately supports our 2024 growth commitments, we are not at all satisfied, and our growth teams have been working diligently to reignite our winning ways here at Leidos and do much better on top-line growth soon. An element of this is strengthening our customer-centric framework of account management. Over the past six months, we've hired dozens of key account managers and frontline growth leaders, each with deep mission and customer expertise in areas of strategic importance. Each of our account managers have a frontline obsession and seamlessly integrate across both our P&Ls and our office of technology to ensure we couple best-in-class teams with best-in-class technical solutions. Two examples which illustrate this point are our recent hires for INDOPACOM and AUKUS. Because of their respective hard work in very short order, we've won strategic awards to support military exercises that are fundamental to the US Pacific deterrent strategy. Maritime autonomy and undersea sensors work in Australia and hypersonics work in the UK that fit within AUKUS Pillar 2, and US Navy submarine trainer development efforts that fit within AUKUS Pillar 1. We've taken the further step of dedicating some 100 of our top engineers and solution architects to our frontline growth efforts. Operating in full partnership with our account managers and capture teams, they are positioned to bring the best of the best of Leidos to our customer needs. With the improvements we're making in the growth value stream, we are getting set up for a much better business capture performance in the future. At quarter's end, we had $26 billion worth of bids awaiting adjudication. And more importantly, quality is improving dramatically. Our pursuits are more aligned with our strategic direction, our proposals demonstrate greater customer understanding, and we are doing better at pulling through enterprise-wide technical expertise into each customer solution. So in summary, I'm very pleased with our financial results this quarter and the momentum that we're carrying into the back of the year. We're making great progress on our current four focus areas. This puts us in an excellent position to execute our emerging Leidos North Star strategy. I'm very proud of the 48,000 Leidos teammates who collectively every day ensure Leidos is making smart smarter for the benefit of our customers. And I'm honored that every day more and more of the best of the best wicked smart people in the nation join Leidos to break limits. I'll now turn the call over to Chris to walk you through our financial results in detail. He'll also provide insight into our upgraded outlook for the year and then we'll be pleased to take your questions. Chris? Chris Cage : Thanks, Tom, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our second quarter results demonstrate yet again the power of our focus on profitable growth and cash generation. With clear intent, our team is driving current financial performance while also building for a more prosperous future. Turning to the income statement on Slide 5. Revenues for the second quarter were $4.13 billion, up 7.7% year-over-year. Robust revenue growth reflects the benefits of both the strong demand environment and historically low levels of attrition. The highlight for the quarter was margin performance. Adjusted EBITDA was $559 million for the quarter, up 33% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 260 basis points to 13.5%. We achieved this record margin through business mix and indirect cost management. Program-level execution was generally very strong, but EAC adjustments were a net $12 million headwind. Non-GAAP net income was $360 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.63, up 43% and 46%, respectively. Below-the-line items had no material impact on net income or EPS. Turning to the segment view on Slide 6. National Security and Digital revenues increased 1% year-over-year. We saw volume growth on our Sentinel and DES programs, as well as several contracted research and development efforts. You may also recall that last year we had spikes in some of our large digital modernization programs, notably NGEN and AEGIS, which created a tough year-over-year comparison. National Security and Digital is also the segment most impacted by protests. Still, accelerating growth in National Security and Digital is a major focus of the ongoing strategy discussion. National Security and Digital non-GAAP operating income margin increased 20 basis points from the prior-year quarter to 10.4%, with some milestone achievements, strong cost control and excellent program execution. For the first half of the year, National Security and Digital has been solidly ahead of plan on profitability. Health & Civil revenues increased 22% over the prior-year quarter, and non-GAAP operating income margin came in at 24.9%, up from 14% a year ago. The primary driver of revenue growth and increased profitability was higher volumes across our managed health services portfolio and an extra quarter of catch-up on incentive fee awards on our VBA disability exam contracts. Commercial & International revenues increased 3%, paced by an uptick in deliveries on security products, higher volumes in our commercial energy business and a hardware refresh in our Australian IT business. These drivers offset $39 million of write-downs in our UK business, primarily on two fixed-price mission software development programs caused by changing requirements and scheduled slippages. The UK write-down suppressed non-GAAP operating income margin to 0.7% in the quarter. Absent these write-downs, Commercial & International would have posted 9.7% year-over-year revenue growth and non-GAAP operating income margins of 8%. Although these write-downs are disappointing, they underscore the rationale for the new organizational structure. The C&I team is bringing greater focus on programmatic execution within the international portfolio and they quickly took action to ensure the long-term success of our UK operations. We're confident that we'll get back on track towards our financial and operational objectives within the UK. And on balance, we remain encouraged by the strong performance and demand signals across our Commercial & International segment. Finally, in Defense Systems, revenues increased 6% over the prior-year quarter on a total basis and 7% organically. And non-GAAP operating income margins increased 170 basis points year-over-year to 10.3%. Tom touched on the improvements the segment is making on program execution, and it is good to see the kind of financial performance that we expected from this portfolio. As we transition from development to production on some key programs, we see Defense Systems as a growth and margin driver for Leidos. We're making great strides towards unlocking the full potential of this business and are optimistic 2024 marks a significant turning point towards a brighter future. Turning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 7. We generated $374 million of cash flows from operating activities and $351 million of free cash flow. We had our highest collection week ever, which led to the exceptional Q2 performance. Overall, we're seeing a strong focus on cash throughout the organization. DSOs for the quarter was 58 days, an improvement of one day from a year ago and four days sequentially. In Q2, we repurchased a total of $114 million in shares, including $100 million on the open market, and paid $51 million in dividends. We ended the quarter with $823 million in cash and cash equivalents and $4.7 billion of debt. Our gross leverage ratio now sits at 2.4 times, which gives us plenty of financial flexibility. Next, I'll go through our enhanced outlook for 2024 on Slide 8. We're raising the lower end of our revenue guidance by $100 million, which gives a new range of $16.1 billion to $16.4 billion. We're increasing adjusted EBITDA guidance to approximately 12%. And we're raising our non-GAAP diluted EPS by $0.20 to a new range of $8.60 to $9. Our guidance for operating cash flow remains at approximately $1.3 billion for the year. This enhanced outlook reflects our strong first half performance as well as broad-based momentum across the entire portfolio, but let me walk you through some of the drivers of the second half performance for your modeling. Clearly, we're seeing strong momentum in our managed health services business. Last call, we signaled some potential second half revenue and margin headwind in our VBA disability exam business based on an upcoming recompete, which remains ahead of us. In addition, the unprecedented caseload of disability claims spurred by the PACT Act is straining the VA's budget resources. Earlier this month, the VA urged Congress to approve $15 billion to fund budget gaps in government fiscal years '24 and 2025 for risk cuts to veterans' benefits and care. The VBA customer has implemented several measures to proactively manage through these budget challenges, including dialing back its internal staffing, which suppresses industry case volume. We're already seeing the impact of this change with reductions in our near-term case backlog. Given that veterans benefits work is funded through mandatory, not discretionary budgets, and caring for veterans has broad bipartisan support, we expect underlying caseload to rebound in our fourth quarter. Notwithstanding this temporary funding issue, we stand ready to continue to deliver exceptional service to the nation's service members as a trusted mission partner to the VA. We expect Commercial & International margins to snap back in the second half, and for National Security and Digital margins to moderate somewhat, consistent with our commentary on the last two calls. And lastly, in the back half of the year, we've stood up a robust innovation fund focused on growth. Our bottom-line performance puts us in a favorable position to accelerate investments across the business, as seed corn for our emerging strategy to continue to drive sustainable profitable growth. With that, operator, we're ready to take some questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Mariana Perez Mora from Bank of America. Your line is open. Mariana Perez Mora : Good morning, everyone. Tom Bell : Good morning. Mariana Perez Mora : So, my first question is on managed healthcare and the margins there and incremental margins there are really, really strong. How should we think about -- what is the moat that you guys have as you go ahead to this, like, competition and recompete coming? Because I could imagine like the installed base you have that actually allows for these incremental margins actually pose a really strong moat, but what else from a technical perspective you think that you have in your advantage to keep a good share of, like, this really growing market? Tom Bell : Thanks, Mariana. Really appreciate your question, and obviously, a part of the portfolio we're very, very proud of. The performance we're achieving in this part of the business is directly related to our passion to serve the nation and its veterans and our investment in technologies ahead of curve, so that we were poised to take additional volume as we came out of COVID and had an opportunity to serve more and more veterans. We're very proud of this and we're very proud of those investments that allow us to serve more veterans. And our modeling for what the output and input of veterans that need case management increases and stays the same over the coming years. So, we're very bullish on the absolute volume. What we're doing to affect our future in that overall volume is ensuring that VA sees us as their partners. So, we've leaned in to help make sure that they understand we are invested in their success and their budgetary challenges that they have right now. And that positions us well for this recompete that's coming in the third or fourth quarter, probably more like the fourth quarter. We expect the customer to expect us to continue to serve the veterans the way we are and we're very bullish about the opportunity for us to continue to invest in technologies that serve our customers even better. So, the challenge that we've given Liz and her team is not how to hold on to this business, but how to increase this business over time. So, as part of our year of deep strategic thinking, we're not seeing 2024 as the peak of this business. We're seeing it as a plateau of this business from which we continue to springboard. That's the challenge we've given Liz, and her and her team are responding very favorable to that. Chris, do you want to add anything? Chris Cage : Yeah, Mariana, I would -- Tom touched on the technology aspects, and clearly, that's been a major focus that we've added to the equation under Liz and Larry Schaefer's leadership over the past several years. But beyond that, we've been a longstanding partner here. We've won this recompete multiple times over. There's investments that we've made in physical locations, mobile locations, provider networks, critical staff, all of those things come to bear. And then, of course, the customer is going to evaluate what has your performance been. And, clearly, we can demonstrate a track record of strong performance with great customer satisfaction, great accuracy, throughput, all of the key metrics the VA is looking for. So, we're sharpening our pencils to make sure that we're putting ourselves in the best position possible to defend this critical work for ourselves, but obviously, it's an area we feel very encouraged about our position on. Mariana Perez Mora : Thank you. And if I may, my next question is about the -- as you focus on the account managers and capture these teams, what are the challenges you have on hiring and training the talent, both internal and people that you hire? Tom Bell : There's really a war for talent of these type of people, but we are bound and determined, as I've mentioned on previous calls, to make sure Leidos is the destination of choice for the best and brightest talent that's out there in the ecosystem. And so, what we've started to see, I mentioned, we've hired dozens of these account managers and we've allocated hundreds of people to be our solution architects for our new solutions. We have an environment in Leidos that is compelling. We are an employer of choice. And the more we win, the more people will want to be on the winning team. So, it's not so much a question of challenges. It's a question of helping them understand the opportunity that's in front of them for joining Leidos and the investment we're going to make in them to make a difference. People that are in this line of business are in this line of business because they want to serve their customers. And the most disenfranchising thing you can do for a customer -- for a person who is passionate about serving customers is not fully support them. So, Leidos is creating an investment strategy and we're investing in the people, processes and tools that allow them to affect their customers positively and bring solutions to them differentially. And that is the most compelling thing about coming to work for Leidos that we're hearing from others and attracting great talent as a result. Chris Cage : The only thing I'd add, Mariana, to that is, of course, a very good question, and Tom is right, I mean screening the right people to have the passion to want to serve the right customers' missions is critical. The area that we need to help them the most as they get into Leidos, there's clearly a tremendous amount of capability that we have that can be brought to bear to support those customers in multiple ways. Helping them understand the breadth of our offerings is an area that we are continuing to invest in and that's the reason why partnering them up with so many solutions, architects and other people that have been down that road is critical, but there's technology that's behind that as well. So, Gerry Fasano leads our growth office. He's very focused on that rollout plan and we're excited about that taking a lot of momentum here in the second half of the year. Mariana Perez Mora : Thank you very much for the color. Operator : Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Matt Akers : Yeah. Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Tom Bell : Sure, Matt. Matt Akers : Tom, I wanted to follow up. You talked about kind of some of the portfolio pruning initiatives you're kind of looking at. Kind of could you give us an update on where we stand there and kind of what inning we are at that whole process? Tom Bell : Yeah, sure. Thanks, Matt. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're done with the Leidos proprietary hypothesis of the future. This is our own exclusive proprietary view of what the world looks like in 2033 and therefore, what are the challenges our customers are facing in 2028 in order to affect that future. We're halfway through building our business strategy as a result and affected by that view of 2028. So, it's very much a today forward view and a future back view meeting in 2028. As we are starting that, Chris trailed in his comments that we've put a small investment fund out there, because ideas are starting to emerge from this year of deep strategic thinking that we know are winners. These are areas that we are going to be investing in, in the future. And although we're not going to articulate it, we're putting seed corn out there now in those areas, so that we're not waiting for the whole process to be done to do the obvious compelling things we want to do to affect our future here. So, we're very excited about that. Now, the overall objective and the parameters of our year of deep strategic thinking, I think I mentioned it in our last call, it's not going to be a pivot for Leidos, a 90-degree pivot or 180-degree pivot, it's going to be variations on the cores that we're in now. And so, we're going to be doubling down on our core strengths. We're going to be really focused on repeatable business models. We're going to really focus on speed. We know that our customers are very concerned with speed, but they're concerned also that the people they hitch their wagons to have to have the scale to solve complex problems differentially. So, speed and scale. Trusted Mission AI, there's a reason we had a whole day focused on Trusted Mission AI, because we think it is a compelling technological unlock for the futures our customers are facing across all the markets that we serve. And we're going to continue to look for those areas of white space that are adjacent to the current businesses we're in for investment. Now, obviously, Matt, in the spirit of your question, there's also going to be parts of the portfolio we are not going to differentially invest. I've mentioned this in calls last year. I do not believe in spreading peanut butter around and watching every flower bloom. I think all about differential investment for differentiated results, but there is also not any part of the business yet that is raising its head in the strategy process is saying it's obvious this does not belong in Leidos. So, don't think of this as portfolio pruning. Think of this as simply investing to maintain, investing to grow and investing to grow exponentially. That's the way we're thinking about our strategy process. All that will be discussed at full in our March Investors Day that we look forward to welcoming you to. Matt Akers : Great. That's helpful color. Thank you. And I guess if I could do one more, just latest thoughts on upcoming recompetes and anything big that we should be watching for this year? Chris Cage : Yeah, Matt, obviously, we talked a little bit, of course, about the VBA exam business and that's top of mind as we navigate to the end of Q3 into Q4. Beyond that, I mean, there's not as many needle movers. There is an exciting opportunity in the hypersonics arena where Common-Hypersonic Glide Body and TPS contracts converge and we look forward to extending our work there with an important customer. There is an integrated logistics support contract with the TSA that -- whether it's late this year or first quarter next year and obviously, you can imagine that's a partnership between our C&I business and work we do elsewhere that specializes in the logistics side. And then, looking ahead to next year, I think the other big one I'd point out is the DHMSM contract. The follow-on to that obviously is an important piece of work for us. The team is already in the proposal bids, making sure that we're putting our best foot forward, but that is sometime in the middle of 2025 -- early-to-mid '25. Tom Bell : Hey, just to pile on a bit, Matt, sorry to have a reclama here, color for our pipeline, we've got $15 billion in submits in the second quarter. We've got $26 billion-plus awaiting customer decisions. In the next 12 months, we have a pipeline of almost $70 billion, and our whole qualified pipeline approaches $200 billion. So, we're very excited about the opportunities to grow, and that's why we are very much focused on priming the pump of our business capture teams with talent who can differentially go out there and get this business. Matt Akers : Great. Thank you very much. Chris Cage : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Your line is open. David Strauss : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Chris Cage : Good morning. Tom Bell : Hey, David. David Strauss : A question, Tom, on National Security and Digital. I think you guys hit on the slow growth there in the first half, but it sounds like you're talking about an acceleration in the second half, but at the same time it sounds like you're signaling lower margins in the second half. So, could you just dig in exactly kind of what's going on there in the second half versus the first half? Thanks. Tom Bell : Yeah, our National Security and Digital segment is arguably the core of the core of Leidos. And it is an area that we've put two of our most talented leaders, Roy Stevens and Steve Hull. And they are partnered to make sure that we are focused on how we help our customer in deterrence and being the smartest government on the planet. We don't think that there is a challenge here with the pipeline. Obviously, this is a business where we've won in the past. We know we can win in the future. The margins in this type of business are never going to be over the top. They're going to be in the low double-digits. But what we have in this segment, in my mind, David, is a revenue growth story. There is much more we can do to help our customers in these areas and our customers -- this comes back to the speed and scale conversation I had before, our customers are increasingly aware of the fact that the scale of the problems that they have requires people who have speed and scale to solve them. So, Roy and Steve are partnered with the whole enterprise with Jim Carlini in Technology and Gerry Fasano in Growth to make sure that we're leaning into serving our nation in this area and not looking to back off in any way. So, if we gave you an indication of softening here, that's probably not the guidance we'd want to give. Chris Cage : Yeah, David, I'd just add on to that. I mean, I think part of that is because we had an excellent first half of the year on margins. And there are some things that can move around, around milestone timing and things of that nature and how much special project work we see on programs like NGEN, but there's no fundamental issues here. And, in fact, we're actually very encouraged, to Tom's point, this will never be our highest-margin business, but we do see upside here over time and the teams are investing in more repeatable models in the dig-mod space and those will be some unlocks to future margin upside that we're expecting. But I don't want to overlook some important wins that did take place in the quarter. Getting the next Defense Enclave Services task order under contract is critical for us. That is a key unlock for Steve and his team to drive growth into that important program. So that clears the way for 13 additional DoD Fourth Estate agencies to migrate on to the network over time. So, we've been waiting for that and we're excited about what comes behind that as we get into '25 and beyond. David Strauss : Great. Thanks for that color. Chris, quick follow-up. You noted a pretty good working capital performance in the first half of the year relative to the prior year. How are you thinking about working capital through the rest of the year? Chris Cage : Yeah. So, I'm very pleased with the team's performance on cash management. I think we've done an excellent job. And last year, we made some really strong gains on managing the payable side and more industry standard terms with our vendors, and we've made some more progress in that regard this year. We've been attacking the DSO side. I would say, it's steady as she goes. I don't see anything at this point in time that would be a major use of working capital. We're always interested in great ideas that could be accretive to the business. But right now, we're focused on Q3 and Q4 are usually our strongest performance quarters and I expect this year to follow suit. David Strauss : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Cai von Rumohr : Thanks so much. And Tom, terrific results. Tom Bell : Thank you, Cai. Cai von Rumohr : So, you guys have mentioned that you expect Health -- the medical exam business is not at a peak, it's at a plateau, but given [indiscernible] at least early on next year, we'll be under the new contract. Should we assume that the margins are going to be lower? Because I assume it takes time until you get to the point where you kind of are doing well in terms of the incentives and all of that. So, is it likely that profits in Health will be down next year? Tom Bell : I hate to answer your question this way, but we don't know is the real answer, because we're awaiting the RFP that tells us what the customer actually wants to do. We know that the contract comes to an end at the end of this quarter. We are awaiting the RFP for the future. We're not sure if that's going to be -- if we're going to have an extension to the current contract, a new contract for a fixed period of time or a new contract for a long period of time. And we don't know how the VBA is going to incentivize industry to bring its best and its most throughput to our veterans. So, we have no reason to model, in our own minds, a decrease in profitability, but there is a big unknown while we await the RFP. Chris Cage : Yeah, Cai, I'd only add, I mean, what we do know is that the VBA has asked Congress for more money, right? And that's a strong signal that they see the demand out there, more veterans need care, need throughput, and that's always been the priority. Now, we're in, call it, a temporary situation where they have to navigate this funding gap. Tom is right, I mean, a lot of things will become clearer for us as we get through the next quarter or two, but you can imagine that our early conversations with Health team about '25 is how do we grow off of '24 levels. And that's the way we're approaching it. And so, everybody's clear-eyed around looking at every opportunity to make sure we optimize our performance levels there and elsewhere to continue to grow earnings. Cai von Rumohr : Perfect. One quick one on your new business. You had $15 billion of submits, you have $26 billion awaiting. What should we think about in terms of your book-to-bill? You also have $3 billion in protest. I think there's a big classified award in there. Should we see book-to-bill pick up in the second half? And are you guys chasing some of the large takeaways you've been so successful in? Tom Bell : The team remains committed to a book-to-bill ratio slightly better than 1 for the year of 2024 and they are determined to meet or exceed that. There are some big swingers in there and it's possible that if many of these break our way, we'll far exceed the book-to-bill ratio that they have. But Cai, again, in my earliest call I talked about the fool's mission that chasing quarterly book-to-bills was in my mind, and the fact that what we should be focused on is building a quality backlog over time of profitable business. And that's really what I'm more incentivized and really focused on with the business capture team; how do we look at that trailing 12 months of book-to-bill and how is that looking at our future growth potential with the backlog that we've got on the books? The team is very focused on that. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're doing a better job of bidding for the things that will reward Leidos adequately for technology and the capability we bring, and I feel as if many of those that are in our backlog will start to break our way. So, we're very bullish on the future without getting ahead of our skis. Cai von Rumohr : Terrific. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Your line is open. Peter Arment : Yeah, thanks. Good morning, Tom, Chris, Stuart. Tom Bell : Hey, Peter. Peter Arment : Terrific results. Hey, Tom, maybe just the focus on Commercial & International, just you had the write-down in the quarter. Absent the write-down, you would have had pretty good margin performance. Maybe just talk a little bit about, I guess, either the write-down or just confidence level in kind of the back half of the year, where your margins are, I guess, expected to be better? Thanks. Tom Bell : Yeah, sure. Thanks. Well, first of all, this is very much the benefit of having new eyes and a new organization structure that's looking with fresh perspectives on the business. As Chris mentioned, this is primarily two fixed price contracts that we have in the UK that through increased and very robust conversations with the customers, we've decided we have to take a write-down because of changing requirements and schedule slippage. But we feel confident that we've also taken a lap around the block and looked under the rocks to make sure that there's not more. So, Vicki and her team are doing a great job scrubbing the portfolio. She's cut the number of watch programs in her portfolio by half in these first two quarters. And we feel very bullish about the prospects for her business. I mentioned and I featured in our last call last quarter that we want to make Leidos synonymous with AUKUS Pillar 2. And as you heard in this call, we've taken some steps by really allocating and hiring some talent that can really get after making that so. So, Vicki and her team are very focused on bringing the team together around AUKUS. We've got excellent customer touchpoints in the UK and Australia, and obviously, here in the United States, and we're very bullish on the opportunities for Commercial & International. Also, I want to tip a hat to the SES team. They had a very good first half of the year and that is all credit to Mike Van Gelder and to Vicki, who have really gotten their arms around that business and really made sure that we're on a solid platform from which to grow. So, very optimistic about where that business is heading in her portfolio also. Chris Cage : The only thing I'd add there, Peter, is the piece of the business there that Tom didn't mention is our commercial energy business and that has been performing extremely well and tends to have a pattern where the back half of the year is stronger on a margin basis. There are some critical incentive and award fee determinations that happen sometime later in the year. So, a well-run business that we expect to continue to deliver great results, and the other piece of the portfolio we believe are on strong footing for the second half. Peter Arment : Yeah, that's very helpful commentary. And then just Tom, just quickly the DoD continues to make a lot of evolving changes or strategies around Counter-UAS and I know that Leidos through Dynetics has some exposure here. How are you guys thinking about the portfolio when you're thinking about the Counter-UAS business today? Tom Bell : It's a very timely question, Peter. I have a classified briefing later this week to dive deep into all our capabilities for Counter-UAS. Obviously, IFPC and Enduring Shield is the thing we talk most about, about Dynetics. But within our Leidos Innovation Center, the LInC, and our Defense Systems segment, we've got a myriad of other technologies that can affect Counter-UAS capabilities for our customers. So, we're going to take a step back, kind of look at everything that we've got in the pantry when it comes to technology and decide, are there some things we should be investing in this year to help our customers with this very, very vexing problem that they're uncovering now. So, very bullish about our opportunity to serve. The question is, do we have something in the pantry that will be compelling for the customer. Peter Arment : Appreciate the color. Thanks, Tom. Tom Bell : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open. Jeremy Jason : Hi. Jeremy Jason from Jason Gursky's team. Tom Bell : Hey, Jeremy. Jeremy Jason : Hello? Sorry. Tom Bell : Go ahead, please. Go ahead. Jeremy Jason : I kind of have a math question. Could you walk us through the pipeline for each of the segments for '25 and '26? And kind of give us an update on production capacity and how that might impact growth outlook? Thanks. Chris Cage : Well, Jeremy, Tom gave you some high-level metrics. We're probably not going to be able to dissect the pipeline by segment by year for you, but rest assured that we feel it is robust and each of the segments has opportunities north of $1 billion all the way down to some strategic small opportunities in the tens of millions of dollars. So, we like our positioning there. The big ticket numbers again, $26 billion pending, 200 overall pipeline, approximately $70 billion we expect to be decided in '25, two-thirds of that being new work and takeaway, great position on our BD side and the growth teams are highly energized. As it relates to production capacity, the good news is the Dynetics team had built up some capabilities down in Huntsville. We feel like we've augmented that in areas like the wide-field-of-view satellite payload needs. We've got a facility that we've been waiting to fill up from a capacity standpoint on the IFPC side, the Enduring Shield. So, we're excited about the ability to take full advantage of what we've got in place there. And then, we spoke previously on the SES side about our new Charleston facility that we toured just in the last few months. It's a great facility that the team has built out and in fact there's plenty of room to expand capability even in the footprint that we built out. So, I don't see a big need on major investments in those areas. It's always something that we look at and we're happy to entertain great ideas if there's a compelling expansion to the pipeline, but we're in good shape to be able to expand up to the needs that we foresee over the next 18 months or so. Tom Bell : And just to pile on a little bit on that, Jeremy, the $26 billion of pending awards we have, I mean, that is not only several home runs that we've got on deck, but 40, 50 big awards of $50 billion -- $50 million or more. So, we've got lots of proposals in work. And so, the batting average should be relatively positive on that. We've used the example internally of -- we've had a business capture problem and so to break that inertia, we have inputted energy, energy with new talent, energy with new processes and tools. And now we're very excited about the momentum that's going to build over the next 12 months to 15 months. You'll appreciate that in our customers' environment decisions take time and ultimately they're almost all protested. And so, it takes a little while before the flash of energy to break inertia becomes the bang of the momentum of actual wins, but we're highly confident that we're in a good place and Gerry is the right leader to bring us forward. Jeremy Jason : Thank you so much. Tom Bell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC. Your line is open. Ken Herbert : Yeah, hi, good morning. Tom and Chris, really nice quarter. Tom Bell : Hey, Ken. Chris Cage : Thanks, Ken. Ken Herbert : Hey. I just wanted to first start off, you obviously raised the guidance with the exception of the cash from operations. Is there anything in particular when you think about the cash flow outlook in the second half of the year we should keep in mind or maybe driving a little bit more conservatism there? Chris Cage : Yeah. Hey, Ken. Chris here. Obviously, we stepped up our cash guide last quarter by $200 million, a pretty significant increase. We're clearly focused on converting these extra earnings that you're going to see here into cash and there's always the chance that some of that comes in January versus December. So, at this point in time, with two quarters to go and two-thirds of our cash commitment for the year ahead of us, we just didn't feel it was prudent to increase the guidance at this time. But there's no headwinds that we're foreseeing, we're just kind of managing it down the middle. Tom Bell : And just to build on that, right, at the beginning of the year, we talked about the uncertainty in the market heading into an election year. Obviously, we're still dealing with some uncertainty. We're still dealing with customers that have budget challenges and issues around their performance of their business. And so, while we're extremely pleased with the first half of the year that allows us to raise our guidance again, we're not going to get ahead of our skis or over promise. We're going to keep our powder dry to make sure that the third and fourth quarter deliver the way we expect them to. Ken Herbert : That's great. Thanks, Tom. And if I could, it sounded like from your prepared remarks that there could be upside as well to the expected buyback this year, the $500 million. I guess maybe part of that's timing, but can you just reset in terms of what you might want to see to deploy more capital there? And maybe any change in how you think about the framework around returning capital to shareholders considering some of the investments you're talking about here today? But great, great cash in the quarter, really nice. Tom Bell : Yeah, sure. And great cash in the quarter is the reason that I only trailed it and didn't commit to more. We had great -- you know how the flow of the business comes. It's a little bit like a sine wave when it comes to cash coming in. And typically, the third quarter is a relatively robust cash quarter for our business. We had a very robust second quarter. So, I recommitted. We're committed to repurchasing $500 million worth of shares this year. We're halfway through that now. We'll continue that program. If the cash comes in per historical norms in the third quarter that may give us a chance to revisit it. But more on that as the third quarter unfolds and we look toward the fourth quarter. The one thing I will say Ken, just because to state the obvious, but not to assume it is stated, fear not, we're going to be -- continue to be prudent allocators of cash in a shareholder-friendly manner. And so, don't worry about this burning a hole in my pocket as my grandmother used to say. Ken Herbert : Perfect. Thank you. Tom Bell : Thanks, Ken. Operator : Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Noah Poponak : Hey, good morning, everyone. Tom Bell : Hi, Noah. Noah Poponak : So, I guess the EBITDA margin has to be a lot lower in the second half than the first half to be at the 12% for the year, and the second half EPS as a percentage of the total would need to be a lot lower than it's been historically to be in the earnings range for the year. Obviously, the Health & Civil margin pretty strong in the second quarter, but you're also absorbing this C&I margin. So, can you maybe, Chris, just walk me through that? I mean, what -- which segment's revenue growth or margins really moderate a lot? How are you thinking about that Health margin through the back half of the year? Chris Cage : Sure. No, thanks, Noah. And we get it, right, excellent first half of the year, excellent full year guidance, but the second half relative to the first half looks a little bit more modest. But stepping back, the guidance implies, let's call it, roughly 11% margins in the second half of the year. And just six months ago, we opened the year with an expectation of 10.5% to high 10%s on margin. So, we're pleased to be able to look ahead and say, even in a scenario where the disability examination work levels perhaps come down, we still see line of sight to, let's say, 11% margins kind of being delivered by the business. And that's really the primary reason, right? As we look at as the VA is kind of navigating the next few months, we're expecting those throughput to be lower, and then we've allowed ourselves some cautiousness as we look into the fourth quarter around how quickly that will snap back. So, there are certainly scenarios where that could do much better, but that's the primary backdrop. As we look at the rest of the portfolio, obviously, we did signal that National Security and Digital has had a very strong first half on margins. There's always the potential those are able to sustain at those levels, but again, looking at some of the milestones, we pulled back a bit on that for the second half guidance. And then, the last piece, Noah, that I'd point to is the investments. Taking advantage of this opportunity to make sure we're funding an innovation fund that we can dial up or dial back depending upon the progress that's being made and really make sure that we've got a jump start on 2025. So, the fundamentals of the business across the board are in great shape. We feel good about that. In fact, there are some areas still on the optimization side that we still have ahead of us to get after on indirect cost management. So, I feel like we're really well positioned as we look ahead at '25. Tom Bell : Noah, I'll just foot stomp something Chris said in his prepared remarks, and that is our 2Q profitability was aided by having two quarters worth of incentives in \u2013 hit in the second quarter. So, the profitability of that business was enhanced because of that. The underlying business remains as solid as it ever has been. Noah Poponak : Okay. And Chris, the VBA, I guess, it sounded like you guys are saying you don't have an RFP yet. It sounds like recompetes imminently without an RFP yet. Chris Cage : Yeah. Noah Poponak : It's maybe unlikely, I don't know. Is that sliding out? Does that make an extension more likely? Chris Cage : That's how we see it. It's been fluid. We've been rehearsing and preparing and can adapt to any scenario, but it's becoming more and more likely that there is an extension of some kind versus recompete, but we can't commit to that. We're just prepared for whatever the VA is able to do in a short order here. Noah Poponak : But you still expect them to slow down the activity while that's being sorted out? Chris Cage : At least until -- they've got a new government fiscal year and that'll help them get into a new budget environment. Now, they -- again, they could be aided by Congress in the near term, but our baseline assumption at this point in time is activity levels are more muted over the next few months. Noah Poponak : Okay. Thank you. Chris Cage : Thank you. Tom Bell : Olivia, it looks like we've gone beyond the hour. So, I think we'll call the Q&A at this point. So, I want to thank you for your assistance on the call and thank everybody on the call today for your interest in Leidos and we look forward to catching up with you in the future. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does [conclude] (ph) our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. Please note this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Stuart Davis from Investor Relations. Stuart, you may begin. Stuart Davis : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our third quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Tom Bell, our CEO and Chris Cage, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you will also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll use during today's call. Turning to Slide 2 of the presentation, today's discussion contains forward looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, includes risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, as shown on Slide 3, during the call, we'll discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in today's press release and presentation slides. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom Bell, who'll begin on Slide 4. Tom Bell : Thank you, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. As always, it's great to be with you all again today. This morning, I'm very happy to report our sixth straight quarter of excellent financial performance and I'm also very proud of the fact that the team has delivered high quality wins across the entire Leidos portfolio. As a result of this strong sustained financial performance, our growing business capture momentum and our increased clarity into important Leidos markets, we are again raising our forward guidance for 2024 across all metrics. Chris will provide full details regarding our outstanding financial performance and our improved 2024 guidance later on this call. This quarter's solid organic growth and industry leading margins enabled us to deliver substantial earnings growth and free cash flow. With record adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.2%, we've now achieved 12.9% EBITDA over the trailing 12 months. This excellent execution performance is the result of our robust portfolio of programs serving customer priority missions, our investments to drive efficiency and the team's embrace of a promises made, promises kept philosophy throughout our capability based organization. Our performance in this quarter reflects adjusted diluted EPS growth of 44% and free cash flow conversion of 159%. Our outstanding cash collections this quarter also enabled us to accelerate share repurchases. We purchased $200 million worth of shares on the open market, thereby clearing $450 million of our $500 million planned share repurchases for the year. As a result of our sustained performance and our conviction regarding our portfolio's ongoing earnings and cash profile, we have again increased our quarterly dividend. Shareholders of record on December 16 will receive a dividend of $0.40 a share, a 5.3% increase over our past dividend. The balance sheet strengthening we've undertaken over the past 18 months gives us excellent optionality. And this will be important as we begin to focus more capital in the future on our new North Star growth strategy. But for the remainder of this year, uses of capital will continue to be prudently focused on the potential for additional share repurchases and purposeful down payments on specific growth engines that have come into focus as a part of our new North Star strategy. We look forward to sharing more detail about our new North Star strategy and its suite of compelling Leidos growth engines at our upcoming Investors Day in March. Starting today, I'll take the opportunity from time to time to highlight one of our compelling Leidos growth engines. Today, I'll start this practice with an overview and update on our Health & Civil segment. Over the past year, our Health & Civil segment has been a growth and margin leader for us. Our team in Health & Civil is executing extremely well. And within this newly formed segment, they are optimizing performance across their broad portfolio. And in doing so, they are leveraging the synergies of the complete set of scientific experts we employ, what we refer to as our ologists, who come to Leidos to break limits in their careers and deliver superior results for our customers. We're seeing strong performance and positive developments across the full array of Health & Civil\u2019s customers, including our work for NASA, the National Institutes of Health, the various customers of our air traffic management systems, and our virtual health solutions customers. One area of this segment that I know many of you track is managed health services, where we bring truly differentiated solutions to our customers, which in turn unlock truly differentiated performance. Currently, a core offering within our managed health services is disability and occupational health evaluations for a wide range of customers, including the Department of Labor, the FBI, and the U.S. Secret Service. Included in these flagship programs, we perform medical disability examinations for veterans and active duty members preparing to discharge. Exam volumes for this business have remained elevated based on the permanent increase in the eligible population from the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act, better known as the PACT Act, signed into law in August of 2022. Because of our continued ahead of the curve investments in this business with AI, virtual health and other key technology enablers, and investing in overall capacity, we're positioned to continue to respond with quality and speed to the increased volumes and complexity of exams the PACT Act creates. As an example, we've continued to expand our fleet of mobile clinics to meet the needs of underserved veteran populations. These include those living in rural communities, tribe members on Indian reservations and homebound veterans. And to assist our veterans beyond our own Leidos QTC clinics, we've developed cutting edge care coordination processes and algorithms for the VA. These help the VA optimize their use of their critical imaging systems, such as CT scan machines to ensure veterans are receiving quality and timely health care across the whole of the care ecosystem. I'm exceptionally proud of our performance for the VA and for our nation's veterans. And we are focused on working with the VA to continue to drive down case backlog and deliver timely exceptional service to veterans and service members. On our last earnings call, I relayed that volume and profitability of this business might be challenged in the second half of this year. I expressed this caution at that time because of the real customer budget challenges and the lack of clarity regarding an upcoming recompete for some of our work. Consistent with our promises made, promises kept philosophy, we issued improved guidance then that was prudent given the uncertainty at that time. I'm happy to report that we now have much greater clarity on both these fronts. First, Congress approved a $3 billion supplemental funding request by the VA for the government fiscal year 2024. And this was passed with clear bipartisan support. So we fully expect congress to approve the VA's $12 billion request for fiscal year 2025. And second, the VBA has already exercised the option year contained in our current region's contract. In addition, we've submitted what we believe to be a compelling bid for a new two year contract for this same work. And we expect to receive a contract award for this important work in the coming weeks. We very much look forward to continuing our long standing partnership with the VA in service to our nation's veterans. With this current option year in hand and the new two year contract ahead, we are very confident in the ongoing financial performance of this business. We expect the volume and margins of our future work here to be sustained on the back of the investments we've made and continue to make in throughput and quality. And looking beyond this new two year award, we remain confident in our ability to continue to differentially serve our nation and its veterans. The VBA is encouraging offers to drive even more innovation into veteran services before they award the next set of long-term contracts, and this plays to our strengths. With our scale and technical depth, our investments in cutting edge Trusted Mission AI, and the talent mission focus of our team, we are poised to demonstrate our ability to handle even greater volumes of exams with excellent quality, timeliness and veteran customer satisfaction. Turning now to business development. As you know, we've been focused on fundamentally resetting our future performance expectations by improving the size and quality of our backlog. This third quarter yielded an excellent return on this focus with net bookings of $8.1 billion, representing a book-to-bill ratio of over 1.9x. We ended the quarter with a total backlog of $40.6 billion, including $9.1 billion of funded backlog. And importantly, I'm very pleased with the improved quality of this future work. Quality wins this quarter were balanced across all our segments, with a rich mix of new growth drivers. Here is a sampling. We won over $700 million in new and takeaway wins in full-spectrum cyber. This is a testament to our capability and competitiveness in this market. It's also an early success from the investments we've made in repeatable solutions in our digital modernizations sector. A couple of key awards to mention this quarter include developing the army's new general unified network to deliver a next-gen transport capability compliant with zero trust principles. And we won a large classified takeaway contract for a member of our intelligence community. The Air Force tapped Leidos as its digital integrator to oversee planning, analysis and operations of its advanced battle management system digital infrastructure network, a core component of the Air Force battle network. This comprehensive network links together all Air Force assets, allows for optimal coordination between different units and enables commanders to respond rapidly to the changing situations on the battlefield. The $300 million award augments our growing portfolio of combined, joint all domain command and control programs. And we had $1.7 billion of net bookings within our defense systems segments. Reflecting our maturing product portfolio there, on IFPC Enduring Shield, we received an award for additional development work, and four more launchers after government-led development tests successfully intercepted a mix of unmanned and cruise missile targets. This means we remain on track to receive a low-rate production contract in 2025 and a full-rate production contract in 2026. We finalized our contract to provide wide field of view Tranche 2 satellite payloads. This means we will continue to serve our nation with payloads on the FDA's Tranche 0, 1 and 2 satellites. We received a contract from the U.S. Special Operations Command to restart production of our small glide munitions program. This program blossomed a decade ago from a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement or CRADA and we've now delivered more than 4,000 units. Of note, we're also on CRADA for a next-generation small cruise missile system called Black Arrow. Recently, Black Arrow completed multiple tests at customer ranges and will undertake even more advanced flight tests this fall. We believe that Black Arrow will help meet the DoD's critical need for affordable standoff strike systems that can be quickly produced and fielded in volume. It's encouraging to see these and other significant results from our focus on growth across our entire portfolio. The third quarter was also marked by high volumes of proposal submissions. So looking forward, even with the large number of Q3 awards, our pipeline of bids awaiting adjudication grew by $3 billion and now stands at $29 billion at the end of the quarter. We believe these positions us very well for even greater business capture performance in the future. As referenced earlier in our conversation, because of the hard work that the team has put into our year of deep strategic thinking, our new North Star strategy has come into clear focus. From the kaleidoscope of opportunities in front of us, I can confidently say that the rigorous process we have undertaken has unveiled an exciting set of focused opportunities for us to accelerate Leidos growth, top line, bottom line and cash over the coming years. That path forward and the compelling financial picture it will spawn will be the focus of our March 2025 Investors Day. I'll now turn the call over to Chris to walk through our financial results in detail and provide additional insight into our improved outlook. Chris? Chris Cage : Thanks, Tom, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our third quarter results again showcase what is possible, as we lower performance risk focused on high-quality wins and drive efficiency through the organization. This team is laser focused on sustainably growing earnings and cash and then deploying them responsibly to grow shareholder value. Turning to the income statement on Slide 5. Revenues for the third quarter were $4.19 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Customer demand remains robust and employee retention remains historically high. Margin performance was once again a standout in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA of $596 million was up 32% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 270 basis points to 14.2%, a new high watermark for Leidos. Program level execution was one catalyst for margin performance. EAC adjustments were a $30 million net positive, our best performance in nearly four years. Non-GAAP net income was $396 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.93 of 40% and 44%, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, our slightly higher tax rate in the quarter fully offset our slightly lower diluted share count and net interest expense. Looking at the non-GAAP reconciliation tables in the press release and presentation appendix, you'll see $6 million of GAAP impairment charges from exiting and consolidating underutilized lease basis and we expect another $15 million or so of charges associated with additional actions over the next five quarters. We're closely managing our corporate costs and lowering our real estate footprint improves our competitiveness and keeps corporate costs in check. The annualized savings from these actions will be in the neighborhood of $25 million to $30 million, which we'll see the full benefit of in 2026. Turning to the segment view on Slide 6. National Security and Digital revenues increased 1% year-over-year. We saw volumes grow broadly across our digital modernization portfolio, which offset slowness across several intelligence community programs. I'm very pleased with the margin discipline of the segment as they continue to perform ahead of plan. National Security and Digital non-GAAP operating income margin increased 70 basis points from the prior year quarter to 10.5%. This was the highest margin of the year, and it reflects early success in digital modernization repeatability and utilization initiatives as well as excellent award fees on our intelligence community programs. As Tom alluded to earlier, Health & Civil continued to deliver for customers and shareholders. Revenues increased 16% over the prior year quarter and non-GAAP operating income margin came in at 24.2%, up from 16.5% a year ago. Revenue and margin over performance was primarily in the managed health services portfolio that Tom spotlighted, as we receive more disability exam requests than anticipated and our differentiated solutions were able to unlock higher performance and incentives. Profitability was roughly in line with Q2 levels. Commercial & International revenues increased 5%, with increased deliveries of security products and energy engineering services. Non-GAAP operating margins were 8.8%, their highest level this year. The UK business was a positive top and bottom line contributor in the quarter, and I'm pleased with the positive trajectory for this business area and the segment overall. Finally, Defense Systems revenues increased 13% over the prior year quarter and non-GAAP operating margins increased 280 basis points year-over-year to 10.2%. It's rewarding to see the kind of financial performance that we expected from this portfolio. There were many bright spots in the segment, highlighted by the move to the initial operating test and evaluation stage on IFPC Enduring Shield. Looking across the segments. Clearly, Health & Civil continued its strong execution, but I'm most encouraged by the broad-based strength of the entire portfolio. We had two sectors growing at double-digits for the first-time in the new organization structure. And if you set Health & Civil aside, margins for the remaining three segments were up 80 basis points from a year ago and higher than they've been as far back as we have recast financials. Turning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 7. With the end of the government fiscal year, we had exceptional cash performance. We generated $656 million of cash flows from operating activities and $633 million of free cash flow. In Q3, we repurchased a total of $203 million in shares, including $200 million in the open market and paid $51 million in dividends. We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $4.7 billion of debt. We have significant capacity to return cash to shareholders and invest in growth. Next, I'll go through our enhanced outlook for 2024 on Slide 8. We're raising and narrowing our revenue guidance range to $16.35 billion to $16.45 billion, an increase of $150 million at the midpoint. We're increasing adjusted EBITDA guidance from approximately 12% to the high 12% range. We're raising and narrowing our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance range to $9.80 to $10, which is an increase of $1.10 at the midpoint. And lastly, we're increasing our guidance for operating cash flow by $50 million to approximately $1.35 billion for the year. Our new guidance reflects not just the outperformance in the third quarter, but also an improved outlook for the fourth quarter, spurred by positive momentum across all four segments and increasing visibility in our Health & Civil segment through the recompete of the [Regions] contracts. As you put together your models, we're expecting fourth quarter interest expense, tax rate and diluted share count to remain near Q3 levels. We plan to step up CapEx investments tied to growth in Q4 and end the year at $160 million or about $30 million below our original expectations for the year. Finally, as Tom indicated, our year of deep strategic thinking has brought our North Star strategy into clearer focus. We're not yet ready to give next year's guidance or new long-term targets, but I want to orient you to our current thinking. Our very strong performance in 2024 raises the bar for next year. The midpoint of our revised guidance range yields revenue growth of 6% and diluted EPS growth of 36% in 2024. At this point, we're not expecting to repeat quite that same level of growth in 2025. We see 2025 as the pivot year from the company we are to the company we're building towards as we implement our strategy. We currently expect revenue growth in 2025 to be in the lower single digits, with the longer term growth outlook potentially back to 2024 levels or above. Most importantly, we are committed to retaining margins near current levels and robustly and sustainably growing diluted EPS over time. With that operator, we're ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question coming from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Peter Arment : Maybe just to highlight the -- you talked about $700 million plus in new takeaways and full spectrum cyber, it's super impressive. Obviously, you guys are really -- company's doing well on so many fronts. But maybe you could just talk about more color there and where this -- where we expect to see this kind of flow through the new takeaways? Tom Bell : Yes, we're very excited about the National Security and Digital segment. As I think about that segment and Leidos, it really is the core of the core of the core of what Leidos has always been and has always done extremely well. And we've got a fantastic history in that segment of winning big franchise programs, multibillion-dollar franchise programs. And so we like that business. We've put a leadership team in that business that we trust. And you're already starting to see in this third quarter, the beginning of us getting our chutzpah back in our winning ways in that business. So very excited about that, and we look forward to more conversations about cyber wins going forward. At the same time, cyber has been one of the golden bolts that we've been investing in as a core competency of Leidos for our whole history. And so not only are we very proud of the team that's leveraging our cyber chops for cyber wins, especially for our very, very important in the intelligence community customer. But we're also very proud of the fact that our cyber capabilities and our zero trust gravitas is frequently commented on by customers as a reason we win in other markets also. So we're very proud of the return on investment we're getting in our cyber security business and as an underlying capability of everything Leidos does. Obviously, these are customers where we can't really say too much more than we already have about where we win and what those programs are, but we're very excited about it and we're very, very committed to expanding our capability to help our government be the smartest government on the face of the earth. Chris Cage : Yes, Peter, obviously, [ Aegon ] was certainly something that fits into that arena, but as Tom talks about a lot of classified work there that we can't get too much color on. But clearly, the team has been focused on differentiation and the investments that we've been making and we'll continue to make really positions us well to grow that area of the business more robustly as we head into '25 and beyond. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thanks for the script as well, Tom that was super helpful honing in on one segment. So I'm going to ask about Health & Civil, of course. So maybe if we could talk about where you are, just given the significant growth with the VA funding? There can it -- it seems like it's still outstanding from my understanding, but if you could give us some timing on that and how you're thinking about positioning there and potential risks and how we should think about Health & Civil EBIT as we head into next year? Tom Bell : Yes. So as I tried to highlight in my prepared remarks, we've had a fantastic third quarter in our Health & Civil business. And before I get into managed health services, I want to, again, broadly overview the fact that, that business is much more than just back. We serve a variety of customers, everything from NASA and making sure that the logistics to the space station are maintained. We do critical work for our customers at the National Institute of Health and the National Science Foundation. We do exams for the FBI, the secret service and the Department of Labor. So it really is a broad segment of our business and it's a business that is outperforming in all of those facets. On the VA and on the VBA since I appreciate the fact that, that's your question. We had a great quarter that helped us clear the air. Kind of the fog of war has been lifted and now we see our way through for not only the next year or two, but much longer into the future. As I mentioned, the customer has currently extended the current contract we have them with the option year that they had. We expect them to formally contract for the next two years, along essentially the same terms as the business we have today. We're very confident in the fact that we'll be able to maintain our volume, our throughput and our profitability of that business over that contract. And as I suggested in my prepared remarks, Sheila, we also are very excited about what the VBA is setting up for the terms of the next competition. It incents innovation, it incents technology. And when you talk about critical customer missions with deep technology needs, you're talking Leidos. So we're very excited about that business. We're currently continuing to invest in it. We're making sure we don't wait for the RFP to innovate and bring even more efficient and effective solutions forward for our customers. And so we're very bullish on the long-term business we're in for Health & Civil. And in fact, spoil alert, when you come to March, you'll see that growing this business is a core of our growth strategy going forward. So far from us seeing it as a business that is sun setting or at its apex, we see it as only a business that's just begun to be a growth engine for Leidos. Chris, do you have anything you'd like to add? ChrisCage : A couple of additional points, Sheila. Clearly, again, our third quarter performance, part of that was the incentives related to doing great work with high customer satisfaction, with differentiation. Those are the things that will compel us to be a prominent provider in this space for the foreseeable future. The other thing that you might have seen, it's not done yet. We don't count our chickens, but the customer and the military health side put out a justification authorization to extend our current work on the DHMSM program for an additional three years. That would -- should hopefully sort itself out middle of next year. But that's another strong indication of where customers really want to see the value that Leidos brings and they want to continue that relationship with us. Now as it relates to looking ahead to 2025, that's what we gave our color commentary. This business has outperformed everybody's expectations for this year. Health & Civil has had a fantastic year. Our goal in the near-term is to sustain that level of performance and that's what gives us confidence in our ability to keep margins solidly in the 12% range for the corporation. Growing off of that base will be an area of focus certainly for the intermediate to longer term horizon and we're very confident we'll be able to do that. Operator : Your next question coming from the line of Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities. Tobey Sommer : I wonder if you could give us an update on a smallish program that we haven't talked about on these calls in a while. Sort of your capabilities for unclassified data collection in the BuckEye program and others. I'm curious what the utilization of those company-owned assets is like and what the prospects for growth is like? Tom Bell : Yes, so BuckEye continues to be a very strong business within our Defense segment, where the assets we have deployed for that mission are I'll call it, fully utilized and we're sweating the assets very well. And in fact, expansions of those missions are part of what we're using some of the capital we have in this fourth quarter for down payments for further growth in the coming years. Personally, I expect that sometime in the next decade or two, manned ISR assets are probably going to be replaced by other capabilities. But in the here and now, these are critical capabilities that our war fighters rely on and we're proud to serve very specific focused niche of those customer capabilities that they need and want. So BuckEye and other programs like it remain a part of Cindy's business and it's a part of the business we're very happy with. Chris Cage : And Tobey, I'd just add, I mean, to Tom's point, we're seeing, even though there's been some programs that we haven't won, we actually are still a strong provider in the ecosystem of airborne ISR support to our customer missions. And to Tom's point, we'll continue to see select opportunities to increase investment. Those are high return on investment types of plays when we make them and so we'll look for those when they make sense. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Mariana Perez Mora with Bank of America. Mariana Perez Mora : So Chris, you said you're not ready to talk about FY'25, but you mentioned the low-single-digit growth. And as you mentioned, DHMSM or MHS GENESIS is already expected to be extended, so that side the risk. Then I see a lot of opportunities coming from August. And at USA, everyone was really enthusiastic about the defense portfolio actually getting some traction, missile, ammunitions, counter missile, hypersonics, all those things. What are the areas that are actually not growing or that you are conservative going into next year to actually think it's going to be the transition year in terms of growth? Chris Cage : You're right, there are a number of things across the portfolio that we're very excited about. But what we've also learned is some of those things take a longer gestation period to manifest themselves like we're seeing in the defense systems business today. Growth has been nice and a good upward momentum, but it took some time to get there. As we look ahead to 25, we do like our position. We feel really good about how the company is stacking up. But clearly, Health & Civil off of this substantially elevated level of performance is going to be in a more muted growth posture in the near-term, accelerating away. We did talk about some of the wins in national security and digital, we see growth momentum accelerating there. But you look at the backdrop, we're clearly in an election year. There is a risk of potential of there's an extended CR and some disruption. We've seen that play out in the past. So as we see the landscape here today, we're going to be cautious about those things. And if we get more clarity in the several months ahead, we'll be in a better position to refine that point of view going into the early part of next year. Tom Bell : Mariana, I might add, I really appreciate your enthusiasm for the business, too, and optimism. I share it. I think there is tremendous growth available for Leidos. And that will be the feature of our March 2025 Investors Day, focusing on those engines of growth we see within the portfolio that have been clearly identified as a result of our year of deep strategic thinking. So we're very excited about it. But I cannot remind investors and analysts who attended our 2021 Investors Day that in -- then we promised profitability of 10.5% in 2024. And so here we are committing to guidance this year of 12.9%. And the fact is, even with next year and the solid 12s, we're streets ahead of where this portfolio was envisioned to be just three years ago. We will not be resting on our laurels there. This is just an indication of the kind of pivot year that 2025 brings, but a pivot year is just that. It's a pivot year to greater growth and continued growth for a great portfolio of critical needs that our customers reward us for. So that's the focus over the next coming months. We look forward to having that conversation with you in March, and we're very bullish about the future of Leidos. Mariana Perez Mora : And if I may, just a quick follow-up. On the $29 billion that you have of like submitted bids in the pipeline, how much of those are new businesses versus recompetes? Chris Cage : Well, the $29 billion, I can't give you that, but I can tell you that when we look ahead to next year's portfolio, almost 70% of what is in the 2025 portfolio is new business and takeaway. So I don't have the exact point on the $29 billion, but a high percentage of that would also be new business and takeaway, Mariana. The recompete landscape is quite modest. We've talked obviously about the VBA business and have clarity here on the next two years of that here soon, if the military health system DHMSM program does play out the way we hope. We're really not talking about any substantial recompete. So that's a great position to be in for our BD team to really be attacking new work with vigor next year. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. Cai von Rumohr : Terrific results in Health. The recompete, the profitability is so good. Usually, when you see markets with that kind of profitability, you tend to attract more entrants. Now I know that the entry barriers are pretty high and that's been a plus. But you mentioned incentive improvements. Can you give us any color about the upcoming recompete, and do you expect that the profitability opportunity will be comparable? Or will there be more competitors or a different structure so that they get a good result, and you make good money, but not quite as much as you're making today. Tom Bell : I appreciate the sense of your question. But of course, there's some questions I really can't answer in there. And at the same time, I can say that we're very confident in the continued profitability of this business over the next couple of years and we look forward to the recompete because, as I suggested, it incents the very things that we're excellent at. So there is, for us, confidence that we'll be able to lean into the business to help the VA get what they want, which is customer satisfaction and volume. At the same time, we feel very good about how we've been able to weave into our solutions in this space Trusted Mission AI and other innovative processes that allowed us to bring down our costs and sweat the fixed assets that we have. And so as a result, the profitability of this business and the opportunity for us to expand it are core parts of our strategy for growth for Leidos. So we don't see it as a net negative, but rather an area where we're going to be able to hold on to the profitability and expand the top line. Chris Cage : I just would remind you, I mean, we did get the option your exercise. So we have clarity on the contract we're performing under right now, the recompete to Tom's point, we can't give a lot of detail there. But again, our team really focused on how do we maintain a competitive position and work with our customers. But at the same time, get a return on the investments we've made. And it's not just the work going on in the VA. Tom spotlighted there's much more going on in managed health services with other customers that we're doing work for. So the expansion of that entire portfolio enables us to have visibility and the confidence in the ability to retain a high level of margin performance there. Cai von Rumohr : And if I may one more, Dynetics. For years, it's basically had lots of potential and has had trouble really fully converting that. When you talk of low-single-digit growth next year and then better growth as we move further out, is Dynetics in that bucket? Chris Cage : Dynetics is definitely in that bucket. I mean, again, Tom featured -- think about the BD results they had this quarter is eye watering, excellent book-to-bill, programs that are moving forward to a low rate and then accelerating away. It will take a couple of years to get into a full rate production type mode and those are the kinds of things that give us confidence on the uplift. We still don't have full clarity on how quickly the customer will ramp up our hypersonics work. We're ready. We're ready to scale. We're dependent upon industry partners. So there are some things there that definitely are exciting for the future and we expect that growth momentum to continue, but the best years for that business is still ahead of it. Tom Bell : In fact, Cai, I'll just add on. Chris talks about an excellent book-to-bill. Just to put a little context on that, that's greater than a 3x book-to-bill just for our Defense segment. So that's the kind of quarter they had. And what we're starting to see, Cindy and the leadership team there are starting to really focus from that kaleidoscope of opportunities and the potential that's always been there, to focus on the things that are really important to our DoD customers now to fight for the future. So one of the things we talked about was the SOCOM customer restarting a production line for small glide munitions. In fact that's huge because that line had gone dormant and the customer has come back to Leidos and said, we need more of that product. And that has spawned the ability for us now to prototype and start to test this small cruise missile, Black Arrow that I referenced. That's a direct result of not only our prowess on small glide munitions. But also remember the Gremlin program, bringing those two capabilities together has put us in a position to test is small cruise missile. And frankly, that's exactly what our war fighters need. The rapid prototyping, rapid production at scale and affordable capability for standoff weapons. So we're very bullish, as Chris says, about the future of Dynetics and the ability for the current management team to take all of that potential and make diamonds out of it. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Scott Mikus with Melius Research. Scott Mikus : Tom, Chris, a little over a year ago, you guys won CHS-6. I was wondering if you could talk about how that's ramped so far? And are the margins for that program accretive to the overall business? Or are they still dilutive as you're making the investments to ramp up? Chris Cage : Yes, Scott, I'd say the team has done a great job of getting that program ramped up in the year one. As you can imagine, both programs in the early phases aren't reaching their full potential and the same is true on CHS-6. We saw an early flurry of buying activity for longer lead things that will help increase revenue volume in '25 and beyond. So I would say the margins aren't where we expect them to be for the long haul as of yet. But -- and despite that, look at the great performance we're seeing in national security and digital. So the team is in a good spot there and CHS-6 will be a nice contributor to the portfolio over time, but it certainly hasn't reached its full potential yet. Tom Bell : Scott just to pile on a little bit. One of the things we've been doing as we retool our business development approach is, we've also been ensuring we have the experts who can communicate to customers the art of the possible. One of the things we've discovered is that the tool that CHS-6 is, is not universally understood within the army and we have people out there right now, ensuring that our customer understands their ability to use CHS-6 to buy a wide variety of products and capabilities. And so we feel very good about that. And we're incentivizing our program managers to fill out the full potential of the IDIQ contracts that we have. So we feel very good about the fact that maybe we're a little slow out of the blocks on that program, and it hasn't hit its stride yet, but I'm convinced that the army, we and our business development team are going to be able to help us supercharge that program for part of our success going forward. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Noah Poponak : Just want to make sure I have the time line on the VBA work inside of Health & Civil correct. Because, Chris, I thought you referenced the one year extension from the VA, but then I heard you thought in the Q&A referencing, multiple years. So I guess, how much visibility do you have now on what funding mechanisms? And then whenever there is a recompete, when exactly are you now expecting the recompete and how much actual revenue is being recompeted? And then on the margins, am I hearing you correctly that you believe north of 20% adjusted segment operating margin is a reasonable medium- to long-term framework for this business? Tom Bell : No. Let me go first, and I'll give you some big tectonic plates and then Chris will fill in the details. First, as we said, we're currently on an option year to the current contract. So that's ongoing. Second, we expect a two year award to be made in the coming weeks. So let's call that November, sometime in November. The terms of that contract will be largely similar to what we have now. And then after that two year contract, the customer assumes they'll be awarding new multi-year contracts for the way forward at that point. So we're currently on an option year. As soon as the new award gets placed, that option year will seed and will be on the terms of the new two year contract. And then there'll be a multi-year contract beyond that. Chris Cage : Right. So that kind of gives you the lay down of the activity set. It's not the entirety of the work we do for the VA. It's four of the regions. There's other contracts as well. So -- but it's a substantial piece of business that, again, we've put forward a compelling bid for, we believe. Going forward as it relates to margins, yes, I think you're in the right zip code here, right? As far as 20-ish-plus percent for this segment going forward. We've outperformed that over the last two quarters. You've seen numbers in the 24% range. I feel like that is excellent results by the team. So north of 20% is certainly something that we see increased clarity on now and feel much more bullish about sustaining that performance going forward. Tom Bell : And we're going to achieve that, not only by doing more of what we do now by expanding the suite of services that we provide. More in March. Operator : And our next question coming from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : This is [Rocco] on for Seth. Are there any notable factors that have been weighing on national security and digital growth? And what does the pathway look like to accelerate the growth in the segment moving forward? ChrisCage : Well, so National Security Digital, we featured in our call, there's been some shifting of budgets and priorities in some of our intelligence community customers, not tectonic shifts, but smaller shifts, focused more towards great power competition. Some inability to get the cleared personnel in the right spot that is always an inhibitor. Our team has managed around that very successfully and I think has positioned that business for increased growth going forward. A lot of the key wins that we featured in the call will show up as catalysts in national security and digital and some new work there. There's also been some protests, unfortunately, that's par for the course in this business area but some of those are substantial growth drivers for us ultimately, once they clear that process. So we're looking forward to a positive resolution there. But the team has been shifting the portfolio, pivoting a bit and we're seeing early returns on the digital side, the digital modernization part of that portfolio and expect even greater results there going forward. Tom Bell : [Rocco], I mentioned to an earlier question that we see our place in the universe as helping our government be the smartest government on the face of the earth. I would suggest that one challenge our customers have in helping us help them fulfill that mission is relatively stable budgets or when you price in inflation flat to declining budgets. And so I know no taxpayer wants to hear that. But our national security and intelligence community work really is challenged with limited top line growth against a threat environment that is incredibly diverse and not seeding. So I would love to see a little bit more top line growth and I know our customers would love to be able to do more things so as to help our government be the most brilliant government on the face of the earth. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Ken Herbert : Tom and Chris, really nice results. Maybe, Chris the guide for -- the updated guide for '24 implies sort of a step down in top line in the fourth quarter, the sort of that 3% range with what sounds like really nice results again expected out of Health & Civil. How do we think about maybe the moving pieces within the segments in the fourth quarter? If you can give any granularity there. And I guess as part of that, is it fair to sort of look at maybe the top line parameters and the operating or adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter is maybe a good indicator of starting point or how '25 could look based upon some of your higher level comments earlier? Chris Cage : And so again, we've had a fantastic year and that fantastic year has positioned us to be even more intentional around some investments that we're making in the fourth quarter to position ourselves for the long-term, both on innovation and technology, but also on our employees and employee engagement. So you'll see some of those things manifest themselves in Q4. Q4 obviously does have a higher level of time off, right, vacation time that we're baking in. And just allowing for the potential risk around any disruptions in funding and those types of things following on from election. We hope we don't see any of those, but there's always that potential. I would look more to our comments for next year as it relates to margins, solidly in the 12%. So a modest step down in Q4 is not indicative of how we see the business running into next year. We see strong performance out of the gates there and so you should expect that. But revenue volumes, there are some puts and takes. There's probably flattish performance from Q3 into Q4 as we look at the disability exam work, timing of some materials that could ebb and flow. But as I mentioned, just cautionary note on what happens with the budget environment and vacation and leave for our employees because it's been well deserved. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Louie DiPalma : You discussed how the PACT Act is stimulating exam volumes. Based on your crystal ball, was the exam volume level in 2Q and 3Q, was that the peak in terms of exam volumes? Or should that continue to trend higher in the fourth quarter and 2025? Tom Bell : Yes. Go ahead, Chris. I'm sorry. Chris Cage : Louie, I mean as I just was saying to Ken, I don't see Q4 showing an uptick over what we've seen for Q2 and Q3 spectacular performance. But broadly, the demand signal is there to sustain that level of performance as we see it going forward. When you look at some of the stats on pending claims and backlog of claims, they remain substantially elevated from where they were a couple of years ago. So in that zone is probably the expectation that we see over the next several quarters and beyond, but not at an elevated level. Tom Bell : Yes, I agree. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Josh Korn : This is Josh Corn on for David. I just wanted to ask, so now that you've done just about the full [500 million] of share repurchases that you had been talking about. I just wanted to ask about repurchases and capital deployment priorities in Q4 and going forward. Tom Bell : Yes, obviously, we will certainly complete the [50 million] outstanding, and we'll be evaluating uses of capital against alternate internal uses at the same time. But as I trailed in my formal comments, we'll continue for this year to be customer-friendly -- or excuse me, investor-friendly. And I think you should look at the increase in our dividend as a down payment on how we view that. Chris Cage : Yes. I mean we're in a great position, Josh, as you realize, with the strong cash position coming out of Q3. We still see value in the stock clearly. And with our best days ahead of us, we'll continue to be comfortable moving into the market when it makes sense. Tom Bell : We have time for just one more. Operator : Our last questioner coming from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Matt Akers : I wanted to comment, I guess, health margins help obviously, up a lot this quarter, but the other three margins -- other three segments have had pretty good uptake in profitability kind of over last. So I wonder if you could just talk about sort of what's driving that and kind of how much further there is to push margins higher in terms of those other segments. Chris Cage : We appreciate you recognizing that we're getting this done not just solely through the Health & Civil business, but our other leaders of really taking to hold the opportunities to drive increased profitability. Start with National Security and Digital. We featured repeatable offerings. Steve and that leadership team are really all in on practice areas and just kind of efficiencies that we can capitalize on through these franchise programs that we're already operating on. So we've seen some early returns there and we think there's more opportunities for how we do cloud migrations help us or you name it across our portfolio of contracts. In defense systems, again, just program execution discipline, better bidding discipline. The team has got a lot more rigors on their programs as they advance to -- beyond the initial prototype phases of some of those programs and that's showing up. And as I trailed in my prepared remarks, the EAC performance, the best in four years. So that gets to our program managers across the business, great work by them, great work on the program execution side. And so again, we're not done. I think there's more gas in the tank in the portfolio. Tom Bell : And all I'll add, Matt, is that while all our segments reflect different market realities of the potential profitability, all of our segment leaders are incentivized to be best-in-class profitability. So stand by for more. Stuart Davis : I appreciate the question, Matt. And I just want to thank the operator for your assistance on today's call, and thank everybody that joined us here for your time this morning and your interest in Leidos. We look forward to updating you again soon. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

I'm happy you could join us to discuss another outstanding quarter for Leidos, capping off a very strong year, delivering 2024 results above the high end of our prior guidance. Leidos' excellent recent performance also allowed us to reach and exceed the 3-year performance targets we set out at our Investor Day in 2021. I'm very pleased we were able to over deliver on those cumulative commitments. Against the target set then, we delivered an organic revenue growth CAGR of 6.6% and well above our goal. We delivered adjusted EBITDA margin for 2024 of 12.9%, 240 basis points above our goal. And we drove free cash flow conversion of 100% exactly on our commitment. This delivered cumulative operating cash flow to our target of $3.5 billion. Our excellent multiyear performance enabled us to take our gross debt leverage ratio down from 3.4x to 2.2x today. And now our strong balance sheet and core financial engine give us the financial flexibility to deploy capital to support tangible growth initiatives and drive brilliant shareholder value. All on this call will be aware that since 12 November, our stock has traded down about 25%. As a result, we repurchased an additional $400 million worth of shares in the fourth quarter. That brought our open market repurchases for 2024 to $850 million, significantly exceeding our initial commitment. As always, I want to thank each of our 48,000 Leidosians who bring our bold vision for Leidos to life every day. Their passion for our customers' mission, their fortitude, resilience and ingenuity enable us to deliver exceptional value to our shareholders even in the most dynamic of environments. Turning to Slide 5. In addition to delivering exceptional performance last year, 2024 was a year of deep strategic thinking. We're calling our new growth strategy, North Star 2030. North Star 2030 keys on a specific group of growth pillars, where we know customer needs are growing, market profitability is robust and Leidos differentiation is evident and accelerating. We'll fully unpack our North Star 2030 strategy for you at our upcoming Investors Day. But undertaking this strategy effort last year is proving to have been timed perfectly. I mentioned all this now because a natural question today might be, how does North Star 2030 hold up to the priorities of this new administration? And the answer is incredibly well. You'll recall that our strategy process last year was grounded in a 10-year future-backed Leidos proprietary hypothesis of the future. That work detailed macro domestic and geopolitical mega trends that we predicted would occur over the next decade. Now we see those mega trends coming through at pace. And therefore, we are even more confident our growth pillars position us for success today and in the future because they are all grounded in one unifying theme. Leidos exists to make our customers' outcomes smarter and more efficient. Everything we do for every one of our customers is linked to that statement. We were created to leverage innovation for our customers to meet the immense and enduring national security challenges faced by America and its allies, from protecting the Homeland to deterring and winning battles abroad, and driving government efficiency is fundamental to everything we do. And of course, that's what's needed to expand America's economic strength. All that is what we are all about. And that's exactly what our new administration is all about, too. Therefore, we view the new administration's priorities as an opportunity for Leidos. Over the past months, the administration and the Department of Government Efficiency have begun to unveil an agenda to transform government operations and ensure taxpayer dollars are invested more wisely. This has given us increased confidence in our strategy. The new administration has signaled a focus on eliminating regulations, streamlining procurement and moving to more outcome-based contracting, all of which are exactly in line with the mission and work of Leidos to make government smarter and more efficient. 3 current focus areas are right in our wheelhouse : IT modernization, transformational war fighting capability and increased privatization. First, the new administration has said that IT modernization is low-hanging fruit for government efficiency. We totally agree. The federal government's ability to reduce costs, bridge outdated [ and desperate ] data silos and facilitate the adoption of enabling technologies like trusted mission hinges on having modern, adaptable IT systems. As the leading provider of IT software solutions for the federal government, we have a proven track record of modernizing and simplifying our customers' complex IT environments, while integrated trust [ and mission ] AI and robust cybersecurity. This allows agencies to achieve their mission objectives smarter, faster and cheaper. For example, the disability case processing system we built for the Social Security Administration has improved processing time of disability claims by over 90%, reducing backlog by over 50% and increasing the accuracy of benefit calculations by 20%. Leidos is delivering significant cost savings to the SSA through these customer efficiency enhancements and proven anti-fraud tools. In addition, just last year, we also transformed the SSA's National 1-800 number. In just 48 days, we reduced wait times by almost 75% for over 80 million callers each year. The administration's focus on IT modernization also affords us a great refreshed opportunity to accelerate adoption of our existing Defense Enclave Services program. To date, we've successfully transitioned only 3 defense agency and field activities, or [ DAFAS ], and their 32,000 users, each on time and on budget. As a result, those DoD offices now enjoy better user experiences and better service delivery. But even more importantly, they are now operating seamlessly within a single robust fiber secure, efficient integrated DoD IT system. But there are 11 [ DAFAS ] and nearly 330,000 additional users originally envisioned to be served by this program that are yet to be migrated. We look forward to helping our new Secretary of Defense greatly enhance user efficiency, hardened IT assets and reduce costs by completing the remaining migrations to DISA's standardized, unified and secured IT network. In turn, this will enable DoD reinvestment of real savings into critical war-fighting capabilities. So speaking of critical war-fighting capabilities; secondly, administration leadership has indicated that the Pentagon's top line budget should focus on the right kind of programs with increased investments in cost-effective and high-performance systems. In anticipation of these demands, we have positioned ourselves as a positive disruptor, rapidly transforming invative ideas into market-ready solutions essential for next-generation war-fighting capabilities. For example, we lead the way in maritime autonomy. We recently developed an unmanned undersea multi-mission vessel in less than 18 months. With a price that is, to the best of our knowledge, significantly lower than all comparable offerings. This success has enabled the Navy to expand our program size and scope, allowing us to enhance underwater ISR capabilities and develop multisensor UUVs and other unmanned platforms. We also designed and deployed a small unmanned surface vehicle called Archer. Archer is equipped with a modular mission bay designed for anything, contested logistics, ISR or weaponry. And we did all that in less than 9 months. Archer provides the U.S. and our allies with immediate access to flexible, advanced maritime designs with proven long endurance robust autonomous capabilities. Additionally, we're developing a new class of small cruise missiles, advancing from concept to successful demonstration flights in under 2 years. And we're achieving dramatic cost savings for this critical capability through a modular design, featuring open architecture that incorporates the best most affordable subsystems and technologies using digital twin philosophies and AI optimization. These groundbreaking developments highlight our defense system team's focus on delivering affordable mass war-fighting capabilities with unmatched speed efficiency and efficacy, which the DoD needs today to prevail across the increasingly complex and contested domains. Third, leaders are calling for expanded public-private partnerships for essential citizen services to create more efficient and effective outcomes. We have deep expertise and success here, too. For instance, for decades, we've partnered with the Veterans Administration to transform the delivery of health care to our nation's deserving veterans. With our proprietary capabilities to anticipate demand and our ability to innovate at scale, we have established the largest, most flexible network of first-class medical and mobile clinics. This has allowed us to increase veteran throughput by more than 300% and have the average exam time line. And we've delivered all this efficiency while consistently exceeding VA targets for both timeliness and critically quality of care. As part of this, we're very proud to deliver excellent care coordination for homebound veterans and those in remote locations, bringing first-class care to where the veteran is across all 50 states. These capabilities magnify Leidos' differentiation and recognition as a top managed health services provider for our federal customers. But our VA work is just one of many examples of successful privatization. Another case study of our success in public-private partnerships is the future flight services program for the FAA. Through this program, we provide critical services to general aviation pilots. By providing this service, we've saved the Federal Aviation Administration more than $2 billion. by significantly modernizing underlying technology, all while maintaining at or above 99.9% system availability. 2025 will be an exciting year as we implement our new North Star 2030 strategy, and we're already seeing great traction in our robust growth ambitions. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we had net bookings of $7.6 billion, delivering a book-to-bill ratio of 1.7, our highest ever for a December quarter. And 2024 overall was our best growth year since 2020, with an overall book ratio of 1.4 and a year-over-year backlog growth of 18%. I'm very proud of the quality of our backlog achieved through many significant wins, all aligned to durable markets and critical customer missions, which in turn, enjoy bipartisan political support. Let me walk through a few key awards in the quarter. First, the VA has awarded us a 2-year multibillion-dollar award for medical disability examinations. This award underscores our ongoing ability to deliver excellence for the VA and our nation's veterans. And it aligns with the financial expectations we outlined to you on our last earnings call. Second, we won a $2.6 billion follow-on for our integrated logistics software work for the Transportation Security Administration. This 8-year award comes with significant increases to our contract size and scope and continues to position us very well with the new administration's determined focus on homeland security. Third, we received a $4.1 billion sole-source IDIQ for our IFPC Enduring Shield Air Defense System. So far, we've only booked on task order under this IDIQ to provide systems for the defense of Guam. But this IDIQ provides us and our customer all the top line room they need to ramp up production of this critical capability for years to come. And fourth, we secured a $670 million task order to advance our nation's long-range hypersonic weapon, specifically, our development and production of the common hypersonic glide body and its thermal protection system. So in summary, 2024 was a great year for Leidos. But all that success is just prologue for our exciting future. Enabling disruptive progress is core to our work of making all our customers' outcomes smarter and more efficient. Pure American entrepreneurial spirit was forged at our founding and is alive and growing here today at Leidos. Our passion is to look at problems differently and seek innovative solutions and outstanding customer results. And this drive and culture serve us incredibly well in today's environment. Our new administration is moving quickly with its efficiency agenda, and Leidos is positioned to be a major contributor to the success of that agenda. Building on the bold vision of our North Star 2030 strategy and in light of the new administration's priorities and the core competencies I've outlined, we've developed a set of fast-paced initiatives in the spirit of those to make our customers' outcomes smarter and more efficient. And over the next 90 days, we will continue executing a purposeful campaign we've already begun to work with our customers, administration officials and elected representatives on these initiatives for a smarter, more efficient U.S. government now. Now is the time for us to act with pace in this new landscape. We are exceptionally well placed to be a critical part of the solution. And so seizing this opportunity remains our top corporate priority. As a result, we look forward to holding our Investor Day this summer. I'm super excited about our proven track record of performance in dynamic environments. Our strong foundation for executing a successful 2025 and beyond, our bold vision for Leidos and our North Star 2030 strategy and our outstanding outlook. With that, I'm going to pass the call over to Chris to walk through our 2024 results and give you our enhanced financial outlook for 2025. Chris? Chris Cage : Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to echo Tom's remarks on the remarkable journey we've been on. This team has rallied to over deliver at every turn this quarter, this year and over the past 3 years. These accomplishments are rooted in a meaningful cultural transformation in how we manage and operate our business, which enabled us to deliver outstanding results while building a path to a better future. We delivered industry-leading margins, and we invested to strengthen internal functions, enhanced technical capabilities, doubled down on business development and reward our employees. Now let me walk you through our financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year. Please turn to Slide 6. Revenue for the quarter was nearly $4.37 billion, for a robust organic growth rate of 9.7%. Although the quarter did include an extra week as part of the normal periodic true-up of our 4-4-5 financial calendar. For the year, total revenue grew 7.9% to $16.66 billion or $212 million above the high end of our prior guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA was $508 million for the fourth quarter and adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.6% was up 20 basis points year-over-year. The fourth quarter margin includes the cost of enhancing some of our employee benefits in light of our strong performance, which rippled through the segment margins as well. On a full year basis, adjusted EBITDA was $2.15 billion, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 210 basis points to 12.9%, putting us right at the upper end of the high 12% guide from last call. Our margins have benefited from a fundamental shift in our portfolio. Currently, 43% of our portfolio is fixed price, up from 39% in 2023. As Tom touched on, we view the move to more outcome-based procurement as a continued area of opportunity for Leidos. Non-GAAP net income was $316 million for the quarter and $1.4 billion for the year, which generated non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.37 and $10.21, respectively. For the year, non-GAAP diluted EPS was up an impressive 40%, almost $3 above 2023 and $0.21 above the high end of our prior guidance range. The primary driver of the robust EPS growth in 2024, the best in our history, was consistently strong EBITDA generation. Growth was propelled further by our capital deployment as lower share count and interest expense more than offset a slightly higher tax rate. Turning now to an overview of our segment results and key drivers. In the interest of time, I'll focus on the quarterly figures on Slide 7. The full year comparisons are shown on Slide 8. National Security and digital revenue growth accelerated to 5.5%, and spurred by strong business development results in the last 2 quarters. Segment operating income margin slipped a bit to 9.7%, with normal variations in profitability across multiple fixed price programs. Still, margin of 10.2% for the year was above initial expectations, and we look for profitability to continue to increase through repeatable offerings and higher-margin growth pillars. Health and Civil revenues and profitability remained strong. Revenues were up 16.4% from the prior year quarter, and non-GAAP operating margin was 21.6%. These results were driven by high demand in our managed health services as well as excellent program execution across the portfolio. With the VBA MD recompete in hand, we remain confident in our ability to win our fair share by continuing to bring innovative solutions to the VA to more efficiently serve our veterans. Commercial and international revenues increased [ 12.3% ] year-over-year with growth across all business areas. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 7.9%, down 80 basis points from the prior year quarter due to a product mix within SES and increased investments in growth. Building off this strong top line finish and sunsetting the challenges faced this year in the U.K., we fully expect margins to improve and stabilize going forward. Lastly, Defense Systems revenues increased 6.7%, spurred by this year's wins like [ Tiago and Whitefield ] Tranche 2 as well as additional production on our IFPC Enduring Shield program. Segment non-GAAP operating margin was 3.5%, which included a $21 million write-off associated with an airborne surveillance asset and investments in our proliferated low-earth orbit space architecture. So a short-term pause on the margin momentum built in the second and third quarters, we believe this provides a cleaner and more focused foundation as we enter 2025. Turning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 9. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $299 million. DSO for the quarter was 59 days, in line with the third quarter of 2024. For the year, operating cash flow was $1.39 billion, $42 million above our prior guidance. Netting out capital expenditures, free cash flow was $213 million in the quarter and $1.24 billion for the year, which was up 30% compared to 2023. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $406 million worth of shares and paid $53 million in dividends. As Tom mentioned, we significantly exceeded our $500 million annual share repurchase commitment, keeping our promise to deploy capital in a shareholder-friendly manner. As of quarter end, we had $943 million in cash and cash equivalents, $4.7 billion in debt and a leverage ratio of 2.2x gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA. Our healthy balance sheet and financial performance led S&P to enhance our investment-grade rating to BBB flat and Moody's to change their outlook to positive with the potential to upgrade to Baa1 within the next 12 months. These moves strengthen our position as we prepare for the maturation of a $500 million bond this May. We are still weighing our options but given our below target leverage, our current intention is to refinance this debt. Now on to the forward outlook on Slide 10. Coming off a record breaking 2024, we're even more confident in our market positioning and pathways for profitable growth. Recent wins create a strong growth footing, and our pipeline is robust. We submitted $8.3 billion of proposals in the quarter and have $25.6 billion of bids awaiting adjudication. With broad-based momentum building, we are confident in our ability to navigate any macro uncertainties from a position of strength. Getting to the specifics. For 2025, we expect revenues between $16.9 million and $17.3 billion, reflecting growth of up to 4% over fiscal year 2024, consistent with our prior messaging of low single-digit growth, but off of a much higher 2024 baseline. Our guidance accounts for the ongoing continuing resolution and a continued pivot away from low-margin work. We anticipate fairly balanced revenue growth across the segments. We're guiding 2025 adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid- to high 12% range, stronger than our prior expectations. We remain committed to margin expansion over the long term and see potential for higher profitability in all of our segments over time. We're guiding non-GAAP diluted EPS between $10.35 and $10.75, which assumes an effective tax rate of 23.5% to 24%. And share repurchase activity, roughly consistent with last year. In terms of cash, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $1.45 billion, from a free cash flow perspective, we're targeting capital expenditures of approximately $230 million or about 1.3% of revenues. This generation provides plenty of capital to allocate while also funding growth investments. With that, operator, we're ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question coming from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Matthew Akers : One thing that came up on a couple of the other conference calls this quarter, maybe some of the disruption around the new administration, some of the DOGE efforts. I think there was a period where they could sort of try to pause federal spending is [ probably ] a couple of weeks ago. Just curious if you saw any disruption, I guess, kind of in Q1 so far? And if so, if that's kind of behind us or you're still keeping an eye on that. Thomas Bell : Thanks for the question, Matt. Good to hear your voice. The short answer is not really. There's been some, let's call it, disturbances in the force perturbations, customers that are obviously, trying to understand the environment themselves. And that caused some day long, 2-day long pauses in contracting vehicles, but then that picked right back up. So we think our customers are adapting to the current environment. They're figuring themselves out and they're proceeding at pace. Chris Cage : Matt, the only thing I'd add is that we did take the opportunity to carefully evaluate our portfolio and come up with a playbook should those disruptions last longer, as Tom mentioned, we haven't seen that, but we stand ready to maneuver in this environment adroitly. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Mariana Perez Mora with Bank of America. Mariana Perez Mora : So my question is about a focus on border security and the IRON DOME, you guys have like capabilities across the board from like screening solutions to like counter UAS or like air defense systems? Like how do you see that playing out and where Leidos can actually have an opportunity from this, like this project? Thomas Bell : Thanks, Mariana. Yes, both that you mentioned are, again, right in our wheelhouse and in fact, just yesterday afternoon, I was up on Capitol Hill working one of them. I won't tell you which one. But both of them are areas where we've prepared some big ideas that we have been putting forward to the administration and to the senior stakeholders. As you say, IRON DOME and the executive order on IRON DOME play to everything we do. All the capabilities that are requested in IRON DOME for America from space surveillance and understanding to counter effects for incoming cruise missiles and hypersonic weapons is right in our wheelhouse of what we do. So that's one of the reasons we are really focused on it because the Space Development Agency has asked for RFI responses within 30 days, and our team is laser-focused on answering that mail with compelling, really adroit, to use Chris' word, again, opportunities to satisfy that need quickly and affordably for our customers. On border security, obviously, border security is a huge area of focus for this administration, and it plays again right to our wheelhouse from the equipment at airports to the equipment on borders and the equipment necessary to see low altitude UAVs coming across borders. Everything I just spoke of is, again, right in Leidos' wheelhouse. So again, another reason we're so optimistic that this environment and this administration's priorities present tremendous opportunities for Leidos growth in the future. We're focused on seeding that field with our ideas, the ideas we've had for a long time for better, faster, cheaper solutions to these customer challenges. And we're finding now in this environment, a very, very receptive set of stakeholders who want to hear from us and are eager to advance that conversation at pace. So very exciting times, indeed. Operator : Our next question coming from the line Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Sheila  Kahyaoglu: [ Tom and Chris ], just lots of focus on profitable growth. A lot of that is driven by your Health segment and the fixed price exposure there, which is fairly high. Maybe can you talk about VBA since you've tackled those head on. The VBA recompete was awarded earlier this year. How we think about that next phase of the program, both the top line and bottom line contribution and what the additional provider if it changes the outlook at all? Thomas Bell : Thanks, Sheila. Yes, we're very excited to have booked that substantial award for the continuation of our work there. And as I said in my prepared comments, the award we received gives us the confidence we can liquidate that up that order profitably in line with what we held out to you last quarter. Yes, there is a new entrant into a few of those regions. That's a participant we dealt with in one of the regions already. Obviously, we're looking forward to our scope, our scale, our technology to continue to allow us to have the volume and the profitability of that business that has satisfied our customers to date. And so over time, we'll have to adjust to a playing field that changes. But for 2025 and 2026, we feel very confident in our ability to execute that program along the lines that we have held out. I will say, though, this North Star 2030 and its growth pillars, don't just rely on our growing our medical exam business. The growth pillars, as I said in my prepared remarks are all about where we know strong customer demand is growing Robust profitability exists and Leidos differentiation is evident and accelerating. Those are the 3 things that we picked our growth pillars for. Those are the areas in Leidos we're now investing differentially in because we know that's going to bring us differential top line and bottom line results across a wider suite of capabilities within Leidos. And so we're very excited about North Star 2030, its growth pillars, broadening the number of programs that are high top line growth and bottom line growth in very excited about that. Chris, anything you'd like to add? Chris Cage : Yes. I mean, Sheila, obviously, the teams have been building towards this recompete for some time, and we've been innovating and investing to drive efficiencies into our process. So we won a competitive position. As Tom mentioned, another new entrant, that's fine because the demand signal is very robust. And this has always been a game around who can deliver outcomes timely with high quality and stand ready to take on increased capacity, and that's where Leidos has been positioned. So team has done excellent work there, and we're already looking ahead a couple of years down the road to make sure we're a step ahead for the follow-on. Inevitably, in this business, there's always a follow-on. So you always got to continue to prepare for that. but for this year, it gives us a great platform to continue the momentum that you've seen out of the health business, and that's our expectation. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Gautam Khanna : You guys obviously guided 2025 and have a longer-term view as well with the North Star road map. I was wondering if you could opine directionally on bookings this year and maybe the growth reacceleration in '26 and beyond? Where do you think we end up kind of mean reverting back to you given the strong performance last year creates a tough compare for this year, but kind of more regularly looking at beyond '25 organic growth and however else you want to take it? Thomas Bell : Thanks, Gautam. And good to hear your voice, and pleasure to meet you. Thanks for initiating coverage of us. Let's see. Obviously, we're very proud of the December quarter, we printed a 1.7 book-to-bill ratio. [ And ] typically the weakest quarter gives us tremendous [ wind ] in our sales coming into 2025 and 2026. And the 1.4 on the whole year, our best year since 2020, again, gives us great confidence. The business development team at Leidos has been fundamentally retooled. We have a new approach to how we are pursuing market opportunities and positioning Leidos for [ win ]. That includes technologies like AI in our proposal activities. And so we're deploying AI internally and externally to have better outcomes. And I think that's what you're seeing. So while our Chief Growth Officer, will be retiring in a couple of months, and we thank him for helping us win back our hotspot in this area. We're going to be not missing a beat and continuing to improve our performance. Now obviously, right now, we're dealing with a continuing resolution. So any time you have a continuing resolution situation, that suppresses the amount of orders we see coming out immediately. But we're very hopeful that as the reconciliation package and the budget package moves its way through the administration and the Congress that this year will normalize and new orders will start to come in, and we're very excited about the future. The key to our longer-term top line and bottom line growth is the quality of these wins that I articulated. 2024 has a bunch of programs with very long legs and very long opportunities for single-award IDIQs to have new task orders for many years to come. And so it's not just winning awards. It's also then on contract growth. Another area where we and Leidos have been investing in our expertise at unlocking on-contract growth within program officers. Chris, anything you'd like to add? Chris Cage : I would -- obviously, you're trying to get at the heart of the matter, what, and looking ahead to our Investor Day, and we feel the story will be compelling. And those financial expectations are set. We've spent time building that up. And you can believe that we see the pace of activity accelerating as it relates to our growth. And when we have an opportunity to sit down with you all and go through that, I think you'll see our momentum that Tom just talked about on business development, coupled with our ample capacity from a cash generation and quality balance sheet perspective, we are very well positioned to build significant momentum over the next 4 years. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Louie Dipalma : You discussed several positive wins for the Dynetics Leidos business with IFPC Enduring Shield and common hypersonic glide body, I was wondering what is taking place with MACH-TB 2.0, Kratos put out an announcement, and they listed you as a teammate. And I was wondering, did you transition from being the prime on that program to a subcontractor? Thomas Bell : Yes. On MACH-TB 2.0, we're sub to Kratos and happy to do that. And yes, you're right. We were prime on 1.0. But there's ceiling available still to us on 1.0. And so we're not letting go of our opportunity to serve our customer there. And there's significant role work share that exists for us as a sub to Kratos on 2.0. So we know Kratos very well. We like working with them, and we feel this relationship will help us advance this capability for our nation at pace and in the end, that's what it's all about. Louie Dipalma : Great. And on your April earnings call, you indicated that you secured a multibillion-dollar classified takeaway that was under protest. Can you update the investors on the call on like the amount of awards that are under protest. And was this specific contract put into backlog over the past 2 quarters? Thomas Bell : So the answer is we prefer not to indicate how much is under protest because talking about protests isn't our jam. But the answer to your second question is no, we don't put contracts under protest in our backlog. Those are still waiting in abeyance. Louie Dipalma : Okay. So that particular contract still hasn't been adjudicated? Thomas Bell : Correct. Louie Dipalma : Okay. And one last one, if I may, for your Enduring Shield IFPC system, it's obviously gaining traction, is that system viable to be deployed domestically and then it seems that it's meant for cruise missiles and counter drones, but do you think that there's market for that domestically? Or is it better suited overseas? And if it's not viable domestically, what products in your portfolio could fit into the iron dome initiative. I know that you provide the sensors for the proliferated warfare space architecture. So that is definitely suited, but what else could be applicable. Thomas Bell : Yes. Thanks for that, Louie. So the answer is, of course, it can be deployed along any border that you are worried about, cruise missiles or unmanned vehicles being a threat. So domestically, internationally, any countries, borders. And yes, that is a big part of our IRON DOME value proposition to our customers. Thanks, Louie. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Colin Canfield with Cantor Fitzgerald. Colin Canfield : It's great to be back. Can you level set us on what you're assuming for FY '26 budget request? [ The investment ] DC that we're getting is that -- it looks like 10% nominal is probably a good base case. With [ task leadership looking up ] for [ $200 billion ] year-on-year increase. So maybe talk us through kind of what you're expecting in terms of top line for FY '26 request and how you think about that flowing through to your programs? Thomas Bell : Thank you, Colin, and welcome back. I appreciate you reinitiating guidance on us. The answer is I don't expect anything at this point. And I know that sounds a little bit cavalier, but we're in a world where there are many different agendas moving and exactly where the DoD budget ends up is one of those factors. I think there is bipartisan support that the world isn't getting to be a safer place, and that the defense budget needs to go up. But we're focused not only on what top line growth that gives us in new opportunities, but also helping unlock savings in the rest of the defense budget portfolio. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the Defense Enclave Services opportunity to not only make these [ DAFAS ] more cybersecure and more resilient, better user experience, but unlock tremendous savings for the new Secretary of Defense to deploy for growth in weapons that are the pointy end of the spear. And so we're focused not only on the top line and what it will be for '26, '27, but we're also focused on unlocking savings that can be reinvested by the new Secretary of Defense and this administration in that future to augment whatever top line growth they get. We'll know more about what exactly we expect in '26 and '27 in 6 months or so. But obviously, between now and then, we're focused on our growth pillars. We know that those growth pillars are independent of specific top line growth because they are enduring existing customer demand that we know is growing over time. So we feel very good about the strategy we've laid out to grow in '25, '26, '27 and '28. Colin Canfield : I want to keep it to one, but just picking on that FY '26, '27 comment, are you suggesting that the proposal is going to be a 2-year budget deal like we've seen in the past? Thomas Bell : There are people on Capitol Hill that are talking about that, but I'm not basing my expectations that, that will come to pass. We'll see. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Gavin Parsons with UBS. Gavin Parsons : In terms of the long-term kind of EBITDA and cash flow outlook when the VBA contract transitions to its next generation will you be able to still grow EBITDA and free cash flow through that contract transition? Chris Cage : Gavin, Chris here. So absolutely. But as Tom talked about, I mean, we're already building momentum in other areas to complement what happens with VBA. And that mission is not going away, but we imagine that there'll be an opportunity to continue to innovate there to drive more efficiency and automation through the whole delivery chain. But absolutely, our expectations will be growing EBITDA over the time horizon as we've been alluding to. We'll give you our point of view through 2028 on where we see the business going. But the growth pillars are robust, and there are plenty of other areas that will build momentum in the health and civil business along with our other segments. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of coming Scott Mikus with Melius Research. Scott Mikus : I have a question on the guide. In 2024, you did $10.21 in EPS. And if my math is correct, I think you had a $0.20 impact from the 2Q charge, the U.K. business and roughly an $0.11 impact from the asset write-down this quarter. So if I add those back, the guidance implies almost no underlying EPS growth. I'm just kind of wondering, is that conservatism based on the change in administration? Or any sort of color you can provide? Chris Cage : Scott, thanks for that. And you're right. Of course, we don't expect some of those things to repeat. Of course, running a business of this size and complexity, you always have to allow for the fact that there's things in the portfolio you have to manage through. I would say that as the year unfolds, we want to give ourselves the opportunity to invest in the pivot year for the future while delivering great performance. And if that allows an opportunity to increase those expectations over time, we will. I mean I think the other thing I'd point you to, we trailed the debt that we do expect that [ we'll ] be refinancing the interest rate environment is a little bit higher. So we'll see a small headwind on interest and taxes that factor into the EPS guide as well. But yes, so I think you sluiced it out. The only other thing I'd add, we had an excellent year on EACs on balance, aside from those 2 larger things that you pointed out. And the goal of the team is to continue to do that, but there's always variability in the portfolio you have to allow for. Scott Mikus : Okay. And then, Tom, you mentioned that the new administration wants to increase privatization. So although a new competitor has been added to the VBA contract in some of your regions, do you think that, that increased competition could be offset by a greater share of exams being outsourced? Thomas Bell : Well, that will be up to the new administration and the new cabinet level appointees and agency, the people running the agencies. What we're focused on is making sure we maintain and grow our market penetration by providing excellent service to veterans, allowing us to have availability for more veterans faster and cheaper. And we're excited about that. If opportunities present themselves for increased privatization in any of our markets, we will be there very eager to help our customers think that through. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Seth Seifman : I wanted to ask about the growth pillars you think about for North Star 2030, Tom, and how you -- the extent to which you think about the challenge of getting not just growth but profitable growth when you've got some new competitors coming into the space with very low cost of capital that are evaluated primarily on their ability to deliver very fast growth and kind of the extent to which you're thinking at all or how you're thinking about the challenge that poses to delivering profitable growth. Thomas Bell : Yes. Thanks, Seth. We certainly are aware of these new entrants into the marketplace, and we welcome them. And in fact, we work with them in many occasions. So we see them as part of the ecosystem that we're eager to work with to deploy better, faster, cheaper solutions for our customers. That being said, our growth pillars, again, are all founded on areas we know we have differentiated capability and we know we can accelerate away from the pack. So we are looking at growth pillars where we know we have something others don't. And yes, others might have low cost of capital and ability to build it over time, but we have these capabilities now. And so we're very focused in our growth pillars around those markets and those customer needs and those areas where we know we have a differentiated capability, and we're very excited about our ability to accelerate away from the pack in those areas. So not overly concerned and at the same time, looking for us to deploy our unique brand of partnership. We're always open to partners. We've always been open to partners, and we'll remain open for partners as we try to solve our customers' problem in different ways. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Joshua Korn : This is Josh Korn on for David. I wanted to ask you, you mentioned earlier a pivot away from low-margin work next year. I just wanted to dig in a little bit on what exactly does that mean? And are there implications for mix by contract type? What sort of work does that involve? Thomas Bell : Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. And yes, the corollary to our growth pillars is areas where we're going to deemphasize in the portfolio. We're not turning and walking away from any business we have today. Because of our robust financial results, we've been able to print inside Leidos, we have the ability to continue to invest in all areas of the business while we overinvest in these growth pillars that I've mentioned. That being said, we're also looking at areas where we're not going to continue to invest and over time, allow to attrit. Nothing -- no knee jerks here, nothing, no student body left kind of moves. Over time, we'll simply leave that work for other people on recompetes. And so look for a gentle, purposeful approach to investing in the growth areas. Continuing to invest in areas we know where we can grow as we always have, and then deemphasizing some of these areas that are low-margin work and really not something that our customer rewards our innovation, our technology and our ability to make their outcomes smarter and more efficient. So that's the long-term playbook over the next 3 years. Chris Cage : Yes, Josh, you can think of things like infrastructure support services, big O&M jobs, things like that. If we're not technically differentiated, you'll see us shift our focus, as Tom mentioned, to the things where there are better opportunities for Leidos. And the pipeline there, it remains very robust. Thomas Bell : And better top line and bottom line growth. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Peter Arment : Tom, Chris, nice results. Thomas Bell : Thank you. Peter Arment : Tom, just to circle back kind of on this whole cost plus versus fixed price and was mentioned earlier, I think Chris mentioned 43% of Leidos is now a fixed price, but a large percentage of that is in health and civil. How do you think about when you look at your other national security segments and defense about opportunities to grow your fixed price mix there just given the environment of those. Thomas Bell : Well, we are always open to and eager for outcome-based contracting, whether that's fixed price or whether that's privatization, whether that's paying for a service at a fixed rate. There's different tunes you can play within that song. But we're -- I'm eager to grow that. I think we excel at that today. I think we've got a demonstrated track record of providing dramatic cost reductions for our customers and great profitability and revenue growth for our shareholders. And so the Leidos team is all about that. That's because we can unlock technology. When we own the outcomes, we own the inputs and the technologies that we can deploy into these areas that allow us to differentially serve our customers and have better results for them. And so we're very excited about it and leaning into it. DOGE, the administration I'm very happy that the conversations have begun around increased privatizations and increased opportunities for outcome-based contracting because I think that's an area that Leidos can excel. Chris Cage : Yes, we've seen some of it, Peter, in the defense space, less than we'd like. But in our digital modernization business, for example, cost per user or a cost per person on the network, And of course, some of the things we talked about in our defense systems area in support of IRON DOME and some of those opportunities will ultimately be a fixed price production outcome. So again, we're up for it. We invested robustly in our program execution capabilities. And so this is a direction that we want to be on. Operator : There are no further questions in the queue. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Stuart Davis for any closing remarks. Stuart Davis : Thank you, operator, for your assistance on today's call, and thank you all for your time and interest in Leidos. We look forward to updating you again soon. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
