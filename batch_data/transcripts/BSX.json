Welcome to the Boston Scientific Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Susie Lisa. Please go ahead. Susan Lisa :  Thank you, Linda. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q1 2014 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading, Financial Information. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will begin our prepared remarks with an update on our business progress and his perspectives on the quarter. Dan will then review our overall Q1 2014 financial results as well as guidance for full-year 2014 and the second quarter of 2014. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Dawkins and Dr. Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share; new product approvals and launches; clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected use; our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q2 and full-year 2014 guidance; as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs and 8-Ks filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike? Michael F. Mahoney:  Thank you, Susie, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll begin today with some highlights regarding our first quarter performance and then provide some thoughts on our 2014 outlook. Dan will then review the financials and 2014 guidance and then we\u2019ll take your questions. So please note that in my remarks, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis constant currency unless otherwise specified. So, overall we had a very good first quarter and we\u2019re off to a strong start in 2014. Our plans for the year are to deliver full-year 2014 sales growth in the 3% to 5% range. Importantly, our sales growth will be leveraged to double-digit EPS growth. And we are increasing our full-year 2014 EPS guidance, for which Dan will provide further details. I am pleased that we delivered continued revenue growth in first quarter, along with improved profitability. This represents the fourth straight quarter of operational revenue growth as we continue to build momentum and deliver on our commitments. Our 4% operational revenue growth in first quarter and continued focus on margin improvement helped drive adjusted EPS of $0.20, which exceeded the high-end of our guidance and represents 21% growth. As we continue to execute on our strategic plan, I like to provide several key highlights from the first quarter and discuss key expectations for \u201814. Starting with MedSurg, MedSurg had another excellent quarter. Our MedSurg businesses benefit from the continued high growth in Neuromodulation, as well as strong results in both Urology and Women\u2019s Health and Endoscopy. Within our Cardiovascular group, we are encouraged by the return to operational revenue growth posted by our global Interventional Cardiology team. We look forward to accelerating our IC growth given our strong pipeline and global commercial reach. Our Peripheral Interventions business delivered another quarter of above-market growth, driven by strong international performance. Our Rhythm Management group benefited from C.R. Bard's EP acquisition. Yet, our worldwide Cardiac Rhythm Management business slowed in first quarter. We aren\u2019t satisfied with this performance and we believe results will improve given the momentum behind S-ICD globally, and the recent X4 CRT-D platform in Europe, as well as our recently approved ICD and CRT-D products in the U.S. We also continue to execute on our strategic imperative driving global expansion. International sales were particularly strong, growing 8% as we continue to successfully broaden our portfolio and capabilities beyond the U.S. To drill down a bit, we\u2019re very encouraged by our pan-BSC European results in the quarter with 10% sales growth. In addition, we delivered 22% revenue growth in the emerging markets. Our emerging markets are steadily increasing in scale and now represent 9% of total company sales. And we are well on our way to our goal of 15% of total sales generated in the emerging markets. I\u2019ll now highlight the key drivers of our business unit performance for the first quarter and our \u201914 outlook. So, starting with MedSurg, our three businesses continue to grow operational revenue faster than their respective markets. These businesses are expanding globally and investing in meaningful innovation, which in combination, help accelerate the diversification of the Boston Scientific portfolio. Urology and Women\u2019s Health posted a strong start to the year with high-single digit revenue growth, led by strong international sales. And our Urology growth has been fueled by investments we have made in physician training and expanded product registrations in urology. Endoscopy delivered solid performance in what has historically been our slowest quarter in Endoscopy. The division benefited from strong uptake of the endoscopic ultrasound slimline needle, continued demand for our hemostasis clips and biliary devices and strong emerging markets growth. Regarding Alair, our bronchial thermoplasty platform for the treatment of patients with severe asthma, this continues to experience strong reorder rates and consistent case-by-case approvals by many large commercial insurers. However, Alair is not likely to contribute meaningfully to total company sales until we\u2019re able to gain positive coverage policies from major U.S. payers. Reimbursement has taken longer than we anticipated, but we believe that a robust data portfolio combined with increased usage will ultimately prevail. In the first quarter, we completed our first BT cases in China and our regulatory submission in Japan is receiving an accelerated review.  Neuromodulation; this business had another terrific quarter. Our neuromod team continues to gain global share driven by the industry-leading Precision Spectra platform. Our Precision Spectra spinal cord stimulation system is designed to provide improved pain relief to a wide range of patients with chronic pain, and it\u2019s also easier for physicians and patients to use. We anticipate that our neuromod business will continue to grow faster than the market and gain share throughout 2014 globally. However, due to changes in reimbursement and challenging year-over-year growth comparisons as we anniversary Spectra\u2019s launch, we anticipate that our growth rate in Neuromodulation will taper in the coming quarters. Beyond spinal cord stimulation, we announced the launch of an important international clinical registry to evaluate both clinical outcomes and economic benefits of deep brain stimulation using our Vercise DBS System in Parkinson's disease patients. So now let\u2019s turn to Cardiovascular. We\u2019re really pleased with our improved progress and a return to growth in the quarter. However, we have numerous opportunities to improve upon this performance. Our global IT performance was led by double-digit growth in Europe, which is encouraging given the recently expanded launch of our complex coronary care portfolio and our SYNERGY stent system. We believe we are well positioned to improve our global IC performance throughout the year due to a number of factors. First is the U.S. launch of the Promus PREMIER drug-eluting stent, which has recently captured the leading number one market share position in the U.S; the upcoming launch of Promus PREMIER in Japan; and the expanded European launch of our SYNERGY stent system; and the recent launch of the REBEL bare-metal stent in Europe. I\u2019ll also add that our Structural Heart franchise is really beginning to build momentum and strengthen internationally. It\u2019s still early, but we\u2019re seeing very positive momentum from our recent Lotus TAVR launch in Europe. The Lotus Valve is being well received by European physicians and we\u2019re planning to expand our launch and training capabilities throughout the year. 90-day follow-up from our Lotus REPRISE II CE Mark trial was presented at the recent ACC Conference and demonstrated excellent results with 85.4% of patients demonstrating zero or trace para-valvular aortic regurgitation. We also look forward to the presentation of the six months REPRISE II follow-up data on Lotus at the upcoming EuroPCR next month, as well as initiating the REPRISE III U.S. IDE trial later this year. Also within Structural Heart, WATCHMAN, our left atrial appendage closure device, continues to build momentum in Europe. And in the U.S., our goal for WATCHMAN approval is mid-2014 and we look forward to expanding patient access to this truly innovative stroke prevention treatment. Peripheral Interventions delivered solid growth yet again and continues to expand its global capabilities. The consistent success of our PI business is driven by leadership positions in balloons, stents and interventional oncology. We\u2019re excited about the upcoming launch of our drug-coated balloon in the second half of the year in certain European markets. So, turning to resistant hypertension, we continue to receive positive feedback in the international markets on the unique benefits and differentiation of our second-generation multi-point platform. We continue to train physicians and sell Vessex to treat patients with resistant hypertension in those markets where Vessex is approved. However, we have seen a slowdown in the European resistant hypertension market post to SYMPLICITY HTN-3 publication. In terms of our U.S. trial strategy, we\u2019re carefully examining the available data post the ACC meeting and we\u2019re working collaboratively with our scientific advisory boards and others to determine the best next steps for our clinical program. In addition, we are investing in the Vessex platform and other emerging opportunities, including atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure. So, finally I move to our Rhythm Management group, which includes our Cardiac Rhythm Management and EP divisions. So starting with EP, we\u2019re continuing to enhance our portfolio and build capabilities to compete more effectively in this large and fast-growing market. The integration of the former Bard EP business is proceeding on track, and we completed the alignment of the global commercial teams. We are excited about the potential of our IntellaTip MiFi therapeutic catheter platform, which features MicroFidelity sensors embedded at the tip of the catheters. The sensors provide high-resolution to assist physicians with better assessment of catheter tip location, tissue characteristics, and ablation feedback. MiFi XP recently launched in the U.S. and we expect to launch in Europe this quarter. Another important expected product launch is our Rhythmia Mapping System where we continue to see high levels of customer interest. We anticipate first commercial sales of Rhythmia in Europe later in second quarter and in the U.S. in third quarter. We expect to see improved performance in EP in the second half of \u201914, led by these new product launches and synergies from our broader rhythm management capabilities. Turning to our Cardiac Rhythm Management business, it\u2019s been a very positive quarter in terms of S-ICD uptake and new product approvals that we believe will benefit our CRM business for the long run. However, in first quarter, our global CRM sales pulled back and declined slightly. We believe that we continue to gain share in de novo ICDs, but these gains were offset in Q1 due to continued headwinds from our CRT-D and quad in the U.S., Japan and Australia markets. The uptake of S-ICD in the first quarter was very positive. The launch is proceeding ahead of plan and the physician training events continue to be at full capacity. We continue to roll out the technology globally and for the full-year 2014, we are targeting an S-ICD revenue contribution north of $75 million. In first quarter, a positive interim analysis from our EFFORTLESS S-ICD registry was published with 456 patients and a mean follow-up of 558 days. This long-term large patient dataset demonstrated results comparable to trans-venous ICDs in terms of inappropriate shock rates of6.4% and a 100% conversion of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Finally, on S-ICD, from a reimbursement standpoint, we are pleased this quarter to receive the positive coverage decision from the multi-state commercial insurer, Health Net, and we expect others to follow shortly. In pacing, overall, our pacing franchise posted essentially flat sales in a market that we believe was down slightly. Our global CRM team is executing on a number of very important product approvals that will further strengthen our rhythm management portfolio. During the quarter, we launched new MRI compatible products in Japan and Europe. In Europe, we launched two key CRM product lines; our quad line of X4 CRT-Ds and ACUITY X4 leads, as well as our next-gen pacemaker lead, INGEVITY, which is MRI conditionally safe. In Japan, we launched our MRI-compatible INGENIO and FINELINE II system with promising early results. Importantly, we\u2019re very excited about to have recently announced the approval of a new defib platform in the U.S. We\u2019re launching a brand new product called the MINI ICD Platform, which now offers physicians and patients, the smallest and thinnest ICD available in the market. So, MINI has a total cam volume of just 26 CCs, which is 13% to 20% smaller than the best competitive devices. We also received approval of our X4 quad pulse generator. This new CRT-D generator will be successfully coupled with competitive quad pole leads to offer patients and physicians new and unique CRT-D therapy benefits, including a thinner profile, more pacing vector options, and industry-leading battery longevity. And, so in summary our team is delivering upon a comprehensive portfolio that offers EPs and their hospitals meaningful solutions for their patients at risk of sudden cardiac arrest. We look forward to discussing our rhythm management technology with you in more detail at the investor events we\u2019re hosting at May 8 in San Francisco in connection with the Annual Heart Rhythm Society Meeting. So, to wrap up the first quarter, overall we\u2019re off to a very good start and we\u2019re pleased with our first quarter performance. We\u2019re competing in a challenging and dynamic marketplace, but we\u2019re encouraged by our growth opportunities in front of us. In addition, we believe there is ample room for improved operating performance across many of our businesses and regions. We\u2019re expanding our global capabilities and further diversifying the business. And as highlighted by our recent CRM approvals, we are delivering meaningful innovation that provides both unique value and economic savings to the healthcare system. We continue to expect to generate strong cash flow which we believe will support an allocation of capital that is aligned with our strategic priorities while enabling us to maintain sufficient flexibility. So, again to summarize, our plans are to deliver full-year 2014 sales growth in the 3% to 5% range. Importantly, our sales growth will be leveraged to deliver double-digit EPS growth and we are increasing our full-year 2014 EPS guidance. Finally, I\u2019d like to thank our employees for their winning spirit and their commitment to Boston Scientific. Now, let me turn our call over to Dan Brennan, our CFO, for a more detailed review of our financials and \u201814 guidance. Daniel J. Brennan:  Thanks Mike. I\u2019ll start with some overall perspective on the quarter before diving into the details. We generated adjusted EPS of $0.20, compared to $0.16 in Q1 of 2013, and ahead of our guidance range of $0.16 to $0.18. Similar to the Q4 results, the improved profitability in Q1 was driven by operational revenue growth and continued gross margin expansion, which was up 260 basis points year-over-year. In addition, this quarter saw lower R&D spend, which was down 80 basis points year-over-year, due to the timing of some projects and a focus on R&D efficiency. These improvements were partially offset by SG&A spend on investments in our strategic growth initiatives and our core product launches. Overall, we posted an adjusted operating margin of 20%, which represents 220 basis points of improvement year-over-year and 140 basis points quarter-over-quarter. We\u2019re encouraged by this level of profitability in Q1 as we remain focused on delivering our goal of 25% adjusted operating margin by 2017, and view these results as a signal that our strategies and programs are working. We believe we remain on track to achieve our profitability goals. Below the operating income line, a $7 million gain on investments and a slightly lower-than-expected effective tax rate, along with a 1% reduction in shares outstanding from a year ago, resulted in adjusted EPS of $0.20 or 21% year-over-year growth. In addition, we generated adjusted free cash flow of $168 million in the quarter and operating cash flow of $198 million. We used $125 million or 63% of that operating cash flow to repurchase approximately 10 million shares in the quarter. While we are pleased with the execution against these goals, particularly with respect to continued operational revenue growth, which we\u2019ve now posted for four straight quarters, as well as improved profitability and a 20% adjusted operating margin, we believe we still have substantial future operating leverage and remain focused on delivering our 25% adjusted operating margin goal by 2017. Now, I\u2019ll provide a detailed review of our Q1 business performance and operating results. For the first quarter of 2014, consolidated revenue of $1,774 million, represented operational growth of 4%, compared to the prior-year period, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the divested Neurovascular business and 1% growth on an as-reported basis. The acquisition of C.R. Bard\u2019s Electrophysiology business contributed 140 basis points of growth in the quarter. The foreign exchange impact on sales was a $25 million headwind, compared to the prior-year period, and about a $5 million higher than the $20 million impact we assumed in our guidance range. I would now look to provide more details on the revenue results for our seven divisions which roll up into our three business groups. I\u2019ll start with MedSurg where the total group sales of $548 million, grew 9% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Each division within MedSurg grew faster than its respective markets and group operating income increased 280 basis points year-over-year to a Q1 2014 adjusted operating margin of 30.5%. To dive into the details just a little bit, Urology and Women\u2019s Health worldwide sales grew 8% on a constant-currency basis compared to the prior-year quarter. This represents the fastest quarterly growth rate for Urology and Women\u2019s Health in over five years. This performance was driven by strong international sales with all regions up double digits due to our balanced product offering and physician training efforts. Endoscopy sales grew 5% worldwide year-over-year on a constant-currency basis with six of our eight franchises in this division posting mid-single digit growth or better on a constant-currency basis. Emerging markets growth in Endo was a highlight, increasing more than 30% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, driven by strong execution and an ongoing conversion to single-use products.  To close out the MedSurg highlights, we are pleased to report a third straight quarter of 20-plus percent year-over-year sales growth on a constant-currency basis in Neuromodulation with 23% worldwide growth in the first quarter. Significant changes to Medicare reimbursement for physician office trialing of spinal cord stimulation systems went into effect January 1 of this year, resulting in slower trialing volumes, which are typically a leading indicator of total SCS market growth. We continue to believe Precision Spectra\u2019s ease of use and patient pain relief will help Boston Scientific gain share and drive market growth. Turning now to the Cardiovascular Group, which consists of the Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions divisions, global sales for the group totaled $700 million and grew 2% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, led by Peripheral Interventions growth of 5% and a return to growth in Interventional Cardiology. Cardiovascular group adjusted operating margins for the quarter of 24.3%, represented 140 basis point improvement year-over-year. Within Cardiovascular, worldwide Interventional Cardiology sales of $497 million grew 1% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis on the strength of the Promus PREMIER DES launch, we believe we regained the DES leadership in the U.S. with $118 million in sales and an estimated mid-30s market share. Globally, DES sales declined 3% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. U.S. DES sales grew 1%. Sales internationally were down 5% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Europe was down just slightly as we continue to regain traction in terms of contracting and tenders in Germany after settling our patent litigation there in September of last year. Asia\u2019s DES results lagged the other regions, down low-double digits year-over-year due to the weakness in Japan, but we believe we can regain share with the upcoming launch of Promus PREMIER in Japan. And for some perspective, the 3% decline in worldwide DES sales this quarter compares to a 10% year-over-year decline in Q4 of 2013. So, to summarize our DES performance in Q1, we are pleased with the U.S. performance of the Promus PREMIER launch and strong European growth outside of Germany. This has been offset by continued weakness in Japan. Going forward, we are optimistic that Promus PREMIER can maintain market leadership in the U.S. and we look forward to establishing PREMIER as a global standard in all major markets. Worldwide Other Interventional Cardiology grew 5% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. We believe our strategy to surround the interventional cardiologists with the broadest portfolio of technology required to treat the most complex coronary cases that are starting to take hold as we\u2019ve now enjoyed two quarters of our other IC or non-DES business growing faster than the market. In Structural Heart, which includes our Lotus percutaneous valve and WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure devices, our Lotus launch is off to a solid start and WATCHMAN of a small base grew revenue in the early 50% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Peripheral Interventions continues to deliver highly-consistent above-market growth, posting a 5% gain in revenue over the prior-year period on a constant-currency basis. Our growth was broad-based driven by our leading portfolio and continued expansion into the international and emerging markets. U.S. growth was also broad-based driven by the Epic stent, a self extending Nitinol stent ideal for the iliac's that launched in 2012, the carotid wall stent and the direction micro catheter for the delivery of diagnostic or therapeutic material which was launched in Q4 2013 in our Interventional Oncology franchises. Finally, I\u2019ll discuss our Rhythm Management group, which consists of our Electrophysiology and Cardiac Rhythm Management divisions. Worldwide Rhythm Management sales in Q1 of $524 million, grew 3% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin for Q1 of 12.6%, represented a 140 basis point improvement year-over-year. Within Electrophysiology, the quarter\u2019s 68% year-over-year revenue growth on a constant-currency basis includes approximately $24.5 million of sales from the acquired Bard EP business. Excluding this contribution from the acquired EP business, global EP sales were down 4% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. The legacy EP franchise struggled with longer-than-expected sales cycles for certain products. Looking ahead, we\u2019re excited about the potential of several new EP products, including the MiFi XP therapeutic catheter and our Rhythmia Mapping System. The expected Rhythmia launch and the Bard EP acquisition significantly expand our product portfolio and commercial capabilities and we anticipate improved results in this newly strengthened franchise in the second half of 2014 and beyond. For the Cardiac Rhythm Management division, Q1 worldwide sales declined 2% on a constant-currency basis year-over-year. Overall CRM sales of Asia grew slightly. Europe was flat. And our U.S. business declined mid-single digits, driven by market price erosion, a difficult replacement cycle, and continued uptake in the market of Quadripole CRT-Ds. Partially offsetting this, worldwide S-ICD sales were ahead of our internal expectation as we continue to see very strong demand for the product in the quarter. In addition, European sales of our AUTOGEN X4 quadripolar pulse generator and ACUITY X4 quadripolar lead enjoyed a solid launch. So while Q1 CRM sales were not what we had hoped, we do have several ongoing product launches that lead us to believe that we can be a net share gainer in worldwide CRM for the full year. On a worldwide basis, defib sales of $339 million were down 3% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Again, S-ICD globally and the quad launch in Europe were strong, but this was offset by U.S. share losses driven by a lack of quadripolar offering in CRT-D and our continued headwinds in the replacement market. Worldwide pacer sales were up 1% on a constant-currency basis year-over-year totaling $127 million. We continue to see strong adoption of our INGENIO family of pacemakers and believe we are gaining market share internationally. Turning now to the P&L, adjusted gross profit margin for the first quarter was 69.9% or 260 basis points higher than Q1 2013. The increase was largely attributable to benefits from our value improvement programs and favorable product mix, partially offset by price erosion. Foreign exchange continued to have a fairly minimal impact upon gross profit margin as a result of our hedging program. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $654 million or 36.9% of sales in Q1 2014. This represents a 140 basis point increase in SG&A spending as a percent of revenue, compared to Q1 2013, but a 140 basis point decline from the Q4 2013 rate. Adjusted research and development expenses were $191 million in the first quarter or 10.8% of sales. As a percent of sales, this represents an 80 basis point decline in year-over-year spending due to some efficiency gains but primarily to the timing of some projects. We expect to return to a more normalized rate of R&D spend in Q2 and for the balance of the year. Royalty expense was $40 million in the quarter or 2.3% of sales, flat year-over-year, but up 100 basis points sequentially as we reset to the higher tiers in some of our royalty agreements at the beginning of each year. On an adjusted basis, pre-tax operating income of $354 million in the quarter or 20% of sales, up 220 basis points from Q1 2013 despite continued investments in our strategic growth initiatives which were offset with targeted cost reduction initiatives, higher gross margins, and lower R&D spending. GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items, was $196.5 million in Q1 2014. The primary GAAP to adjusted items included in operating income for the quarter were pre-tax restructuring charges of $19.8 million, pre-tax litigation gain of $7 million, pre-tax gain on the Neurovascular divestiture of $11.5 million, pre-tax intangible asset impairment charge of $55.2 million, pre-tax contingent consideration benefit of $22.4 million, and pre-tax amortization expense of $108.9 million. The $55.2 million intangible asset impairment charge is the result of our interim impairment analysis. In conjunction with our ongoing analysis to determine next steps for our Vessex clinical program, we revised our expectations of the renal de-nervation market size and thus recorded this Q1 pre-tax impairment charge to in process R&D of $9.4 million and a core technology charge of $45.8 million related to Vessex. Now, I\u2019ll move on to other income and expense, which primarily consisted of interest expense. Net interest expense for the quarter was $53.1 million as compared to $63.6 million in Q1 last year, due primarily to the refinancing of our public debt in Q3 last year. Our average interest expense rate in Q1 2014 was 4.8% or approximately 90 basis points lower than Q1 2013. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 8.9% on a reported basis and a 11.9% on an adjusted basis. The difference between our reported and adjusted tax rates for the quarter is attributable to charges excluded in determining our non-GAAP results. Finally, adjusted EPS of $0.20 per share represents 21% year-over-year growth. As mentioned, included in the adjusted EPS calculation is an approximate $7 million gain on an investment, which coupled with a slightly lower-than-expected tax rate in aggregate added approximately $0.01 to adjusted EPS. On a reported GAAP basis, Q1 2014 EPS was $0.10, and included an intangible asset impairment charge, acquisition and divestiture related net credits, litigation-related credits, restructuring- related charges, discrete tax items and amortization expense totaling $1 35 million after-tax. This $0.10 of GAAP EPS in Q1 this year compares to a GAAP loss per share of $0.26 in the prior-year period that was driven primarily by a goodwill impairment charge in Q1 2013. Moving on to the balance sheet, DSO of 62 days decreased one day compared to March of last year, due primarily to strong collection in the U.S. and Europe. Days inventory on hand of 155 days was up 22 days compared to March of last year and up 6.5 days compared to December 2013 due to higher inventory in advance of launches, primarily S-ICD, Promus PREMIER and the European quad launch and lower cost of goods sold, driven primarily by standard cost improvements and a favorable product mix. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $168 million, compared to $181 million in Q1 of last year. Capital expenditures of $59 million, compared to $53 million in Q1 last year. Turning to share repurchases, we repurchased approximately 10 million shares for $125 million in the first quarter of 2014. Since July 2011, we\u2019ve repurchased 248 million shares or approximately 16% of our outstanding shares. We currently have $535 million of capacity remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We value returning cash to shareholders, and as always continuation of our share repurchase program in 2014 is subject to business development opportunities, market conditions, our stock performance, regulatory trading windows, and other factors. I\u2019d like to conclude with guidance for Q2 and full-year 2014. For the full-year 2014, we continue to expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $7.3 billion to $7.5 billion, which represents growth of 2% to 5% year-over-year on a reported basis and growth of 3% to 5% operationally. We continue to expect foreign exchange to be a net neutral for the full-year 2014. Included in this revenue guidance is an estimated 100-plus basis point full-year contribution from our adjacencies, primarily driven by the WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure device, the Lotus percutaneous valve and the Alair system for bronchial thermoplasty. We now expect adjusted EPS for the full-year 2014 to be in a range of $0.77 to $0.82 and we encourage you to model for the midpoint of the range. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.36 to $0.41. Although it will be necessary to make trade outs within the P&L in any given time period, we remain focused on achieving our goal of at least 100 basis points of annual adjusted operating margin improvement and reaching an overall 25% operating margin by 2017. We believe that our strategies and programs to improve profitability are working and we remain on track to achieve this goal. Now turning specifically to Q2 2014, we expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $1,840 million to $1,890 million. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the tailwind from FX should be approximately $5 million or 25 basis points relative to Q2 last year. On an operational basis, we expect consolidated Q2 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of plus 3% to plus 5%. For the second quarter, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.18 to $0.20 per share and reported GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.06 to $0.08 per share. For the detailed Q2 P&L, our expectation is for gross margin in a range of 70% to 71%, SG&A spending in a range of 36.5% to 37.5%, R&D spending in a range of 11.5% to 12% and royalties in a range of 2% to 2.5% of sales, resulting in a targeted operating margin of 19% to 20%. Our tax rate expectation for Q2 is consistent with our full-year 2014 expected tax rate in the range of 13% to 15%. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Susie who will moderate the Q&A. Susan Lisa : Thanks, Dan. Linda, let\u2019s open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. Operator : (Operator Instructions) We have a question from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead. Rick Wise - Stifel Nicolaus : Let me start if I could with CRM. Obviously, Mike, you said not what you hoped. And, but during the quarter, since the quarter you continue to roll out all these new products. Do you have what you need in hand now to get this more on a positive growth track in the second half? And maybe, Dan, you could talk about do we return, does the business return to positive growth as we proceed through the year? How do we think about that? Michael F. Mahoney: So, overall and if you look at CRM more broadly, we certainly like our full quarter trend that we\u2019ve had in CRM and we\u2019re really pleased how we\u2019ve positioned ourselves from a portfolio perspective going forward and I\u2019ll touch on that in a minute. We are disappointed in the Q1 results. It\u2019s really driven in the U.S. because we had some excellent performance outside the U.S. where we likely gained share in defib outside the U.S. and also at minimum held share globally in pacer. So our challenge really for the quarter only was in the U.S. and we think we were impacted likely. We don\u2019t have a CRT-D device yet in the U.S. and so we\u2019re likely impacted by headwinds in CRT-D and also ongoing replacement challenges that we have in the business, but offset by a de novo -- continued de novo share gain in the U.S. So in the U.S., we particularly are excited about the new launches that we have. So as you saw in the press release and you read, we had a number of really big approvals that will help this business going forward for the long term. We have a new MINI platform which is 15% to -- or 13% to 20% smaller than our competitive devices. We have the approval of our new X4 quad can and we have really been out of the CRT-D game globally for a long time. So, we will not only launch this device including the lead in Europe from now on, but also have the quad can available to launch with competitive lead devices in the U.S. So we think the combination of this in Europe and in the U.S. will clearly provide some enhanced revenue in CRT-D which has been the troubling segment within CRM. So you combine that with our S-ICD device and now our longevity story as well as a device that provides the smallest profile, we think we do have a highly differentiated portfolio and we are positioned to improve our performance moving forward. Daniel J. Brennan: And so Rick to follow up, as I said in my prepared comments, I do expect that we would be a net share gainer for the rest of the year based on the portfolio that Mike has just mentioned in terms of S-ICD, the quad system in Europe, the quad can in the U.S. and then MINI in the U.S. and Europe. From a profitability perspective, the good news is that despite going backwards in sales, we still were able to add 140 basis points in operating margin year-over-year, and we\u2019ve been very public about the fact that we have plans in place to do that within the Rhythm Management group without growth and that growth could be upside. So, we are looking forward to the rest of the year relative to sales and obviously very focused on profitability every quarter. Rick Wise - Stifel Nicolaus :  One quick follow-up on the S-ICD, our survey work suggests you have trained roughly half the docs in the U.S., I don't know if that is representative of the larger market. Do you hope to train everybody on the S-ICD this year? And maybe talk a little bit about reorder rates if it is not too soon. Thanks. Michael F. Mahoney: Yes, in terms of the training, I\u2019ll turn that question -- that comment over to Ken Stein, Dr. Ken Stein in a second. We did provide guidance in the call today for the first time in terms of revenue projections. We guided towards at minimum $75 million or exceeding $75 million in sales for the full year of S-ICD. So we want to provide that guidance. We\u2019re not going to provide quarterly actual results, but we feel we\u2019re certainly on track to deliver in excess of $75 million for the year. But, Dr. Stein, if you want to comment on the training? Ken Stein : Your order of magnitude right in the rough proportion of cardiac implanting physicians who we\u2019ve trained already. We, again as Mike said during his prepared remarks, we really continue to be fully subscribed in all the training courses that we offer and we are going to continue to train folks on this device through the end of this year and next year. Operator : We have a question from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : So also want to focus a little bit on U.S. ICDs. So if S-ICD was ahead of plan, I am just wondering what specifically in the quarter was worse than you expected on U.S. ICDs. And did pricing change relative to what it has been the last couple quarters? Do you think the market was a little soft? Just wondering if you could give a little bit more color. And as part of that, I am curious as to what percentage of your U.S. ICD sales are CRT-D and how that has been trending? Michael F. Mahoney: Overall, again, I\u2019ll answer your question specifically on ICD, we felt it was a very strong quarter comprehensively for BSC with our sales growth on track and also increasing the full-year guidance for the year and double-digit EPS with a broad portfolio. But specific to U.S., again, we are much stronger outside the U.S. in ICDs, but in the U.S. really the two categories continue to be the CRT-D, which we think is a segment and we haven\u2019t broken out the exact percent, but we think it\u2019s a segment that has been growing more quickly and we\u2019ve also been had a headwind in our replacements. And in particular, we offer a leading battery longevity platform. And we think that\u2019s excellent for patients and physicians particularly moving forward in this new environment, but it also does provide us a headwind with our replacement cycle. So, really those two factors have hampered us in the U.S., the CRT-D, which is a segment that is growing and also the headwind that we have with our battery longevity which we think will ultimately be a tailwind for us given the economics of the health care system. Again, we think this will improve with the new launch that we have of our quad-enabled CRT-D device, which we think is very innovative and it will offer physicians and patients the choice. With the quad solution in the U.S., we think it\u2019s clinically differentiated from St. Jude for the reasons discussed earlier. On pricing, we didn\u2019t see anything dramatically different in price, kind of consistent with our fourth quarter. And we also -- we can verify, but we also feel there may have been some larger competitive balking in the quarter, in the first quarter of 2014. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : Okay, that is interesting and helpful. I will let others follow up on that. I just want to ask Dan one other quick one. I know the EPS guidance went up by $0.02 relative to your previous guidance. You rattled off a bunch of other categories. Dan, did anything else change in terms of the moving parts of your guidance say on operating margin or tax rate or anything like that? Or is it all consistent with what you said previously? Daniel J. Brennan: For which period, Bob? Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : Sorry, for the full-year 2014. Daniel J. Brennan: No, I think for the most part if you go back and look at the full-year guidance ranges for the P&L that we gave at our Q4 call and now they are relatively consistent. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : Okay. Anything change though at all? Michael F. Mahoney: Nothing. Nothing of any materiality. If you look at the ranges we gave for gross margin and SG&A and R&D and tax rate, they are all very consistent. Operator : We have a question from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Lewis - Morgan Stanley : Mike, I appreciate it's a lot of questions on CRM this morning. I guess we sort of looking at the math here in this quarter, your growth rate on a comp adjusted basis into this quarter decelerated virtually identically to your other competitor that has already reported. So I know we are talking about new dynamics in the quarter. Maybe you could sort of talk about in the -- that from a market perspective it does appear that two different providers are down materially fourth quarter to first quarter. So how much of this in your mind is simply market? And if there were sort of pull-through effects in the fourth quarter that we haven't seen here in the first quarter, do you have any sense of how those trends have looked here in the early part of the second quarter? Michael F. Mahoney: Yes. We\u2019ll see when Medtronic reports in a few months here, little bit more in the first quarter in terms of the market, but overall in the first quarter, we didn\u2019t see a significant shift really from third quarter, fourth quarter of 2013. Globally, we\u2019re still calling the CRM market kind of flattish to slightly negative. We\u2019ve talked about price being in the kind of negative 3% to negative 5% range globally and really almost essentially offset by volume. So we haven\u2019t seen a significant market change in first quarter. And I think in terms of our performance again, ex-U.S. defib, our business globally performed quite well and we had a number of promising launches and we discussed likeliness and competitive balking as well as some of the headwinds in CRT-D replacement. And some of the new launches that we have we believe will offset some of those trends as we move forward in \u201814. No big market shifts that we saw in the first quarter. David Lewis - Morgan Stanley : And then, Dan, obviously across your segment reporting here in the first quarter, the biggest relative change obviously was in CRM, which I think those margins almost doubled here in the quarter. As you think about the balance of the year, Dan, and we think about MedSurg and Cardio versus CRM, can you just talk about how you think those general trends -- how much relative improvement can we see in CRM versus some of the other segments and should we assume the majority of the improvement here in 2014 is going to come out of the CRM division versus the other two lines? Daniel J. Brennan: And I think just to be clear, you\u2019re talking about a doubling from Q4? David Lewis - Morgan Stanley :  That\u2019s correct. Daniel J. Brennan: So looking at Q4 Rhythm Management to Q1, yes, that\u2019s correct, and we had talked about it on our Q4 call some one-time items that were included in Q4. So very pleased with what we saw in Q1 from a Rhythm Management perspective. So just quickly as you go through the three segments, we expect to see the Rhythm Management segment produce more relative to the others because obviously there is more room for that segment to go. But the other segments, both in MedSurg and in Cardiovascular should leverage the growth that\u2019s anticipated in there, and as I mentioned earlier, Rhythm Management, we have plans in place to do that without growth and growth would be upside for that. So, all three will contribute, but I think to your point, Rhythm Management will contribute more overall since it\u2019s coming from such a lower position than the other two. Operator : We have a question from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open Mr. Weinstein. Okay. I\u2019m not hearing anyone. I believe we\u2019ll go on to the next. We have a question from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets : I wanted to talk about the stent business which is back on track. In the U.S. you called out Promus PREMIER and it performed very well. I'm wondering if you can call outside the U.S., talk to us about how SYNERGY is launching? A lot of our channel checks suggest SYNERGY is a very differentiated stent and I know it is just getting launched in Europe. But can you give us some feedback in terms of how many countries have been launched, what the pricing dynamic, anything that you can give us that tells us that this differentiated product is going to be a share gainer for you in Europe this year? Michael F. Mahoney: Absolutely, Glenn. Overall, we\u2019re really pleased with our performance in Intervention Cardiology and we think we have a lot of room to grow in this one. It\u2019s the first quarter that we\u2019ve grown this segment of our business, which is critical for us given its high profitability in probably four to five years. And we have a lot of room to improve that.  Just breaking down on the IC performance quickly, we talk about our IC Other business as well, which is becoming quite meaningful for us in terms of its size from 5%. The DES business globally was down. We had a very strong performance in Europe and we\u2019re challenged a bit more in Japan. And the good news in Japan we expect from a Promus PREMIER launch sometime over the next 90 days, which will really change our trajectory in Japan. So as you look forward with the Japan approval of Promus PREMIER, the momentum that we have in Europe and the -- retaking the number one share position without dramatically changing pricing trends, we like our position. Specifically with SYNERGY in Europe, we continue to follow this kind of three segment strategy in Europe, because we want to establish SYNERGY which we have successfully as a premium product due to its clinical characteristics, and so at future meetings, we will provide more detail in terms of the specific mix of SYNERGY. But we don\u2019t sell it in all markets, we sell it in four to five countries in Europe that can justify a premium pricing. So in those markets, we have a much higher market share of SYNERGY -- much higher mix. In a market that can\u2019t support premium pricing, we don\u2019t even launch SYNERGY. So in those markets, we lead with our Promus PREMIER brand and then we also have a Promus for a low-end product. So we feel like our portfolio is positioned extremely well combined with our complex coronary and imaging business. And those products will be launched in Japan, the PREMIER device as we get into the third quarter and eventually SYNERGY likely the fourth quarter of \u201815 in the U.S. So we think our DES portfolio is uniquely positioned to manage price effectively and to gain share responsibly and complemented with our complex coronary strategy. Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets : And just one quick follow-up. You mentioned Promus PREMIER Japan being launched in 90 days. It is a little bit sooner than we thought. Is that going to be launched also with reimbursement in place? Michael F. Mahoney: Yes, we don\u2019t see any issues with the reimbursement with Promus PREMIER in Japan. So the answer is yes. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open. Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan: I apologize, we missed the last few minutes of the call, so if this was asked. But I wanted to ask on two end markets, Mike. One was peripheral vascular and that\u2019s because your performance was so strong this quarter and you have had competitors who have made comments, Bard in particular, that the market has gotten worse, that there has been incremental pricing pressure in particular in Europe and that is where you guys felt the strength. So, could you talk a little bit about that market and your own success there? And then second, I don't know if this was covered in the last minute, but Neuromodulation where we've had this discussion about the impact of the reimbursement change and what that would mean to your business. You seem to suggest that while you expect it to continue to grow above market that the spread between you and the market would narrow over the balance of the year. So could you add a little bit more meat to the bone there? Thanks. Michael F. Mahoney: Sure. Thank you. The first one on our peripheral business globally, we grew that 5% ahead of market for a number of quarters in a row. And it\u2019s really not one particular product, we have a very well-balanced portfolio there, very strong commercial team and a nice pipeline. In terms of the market, we haven\u2019t seen a dramatic reduction in pricing in our peripheral business. So there are some pricing challenges there, but we didn\u2019t see a hiccup or a catalyst of price declines in the quarter. And so we continue to see very low single-digit price declines in peripheral, offset by volume, gets us to about 5% growth globally. So, overall, we think it\u2019s a relatively healthy market and that will still pay for innovation. So we like our cover progress in PI globally and we will be launching our drug-eluting balloon in Europe in the future here. Regarding Neuromodulation, this has really been a gem with - or it is a gem with Boston Scientific and we did guide towards slower growth the remaining three quarters. We are confident we\u2019ll continue to gain share. That business has a lot of momentum, a very differentiated platform, but the headwinds you called out one, the reimbursement changes in the outpatient settings and also the anniversary of a launch and very strong comps, plus 20% growth comps that will be entering the second quarter. So we didn\u2019t provide guidance as to what our growth would be in the second, third and fourth quarter, but it will be slower, it will taper from what it has been the last four quarters, really driven by both of those factors, but we still believe it will be a healthy contributor to the top line and faster to market. Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan: One last follow-up. Dan, on the 140 basis points of margin expansion in the CRM business this quarter which you (indiscernible) what you guys thought. How much of that came from R&D reduction versus gross margin expansion or SG&A reduction, do you have that? Daniel J. Brennan: Yes. I think the majority of it would -- more of it would come from gross margin than would come specifically from R&D. But the point is, it\u2019s really - it\u2019s all throughout the P&L. It won\u2019t be just one area of the P&L that will drive the improvements that we\u2019re going to make in that segment. All will contribute, but the gross margin should be the largest contributor of the line items. Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan:  And overall the R&D, you saw this quarter for the company as a whole, do you expect that to balance out over the balance of the year to be less of a driver of the earnings growth? Daniel J. Brennan: Yes. That\u2019s fair Mike. So I think we were sub-11% for the quarter in R&D as a percentage of sales in Q1 and we\u2019ve guided for a 11.5% to 12% for Q2. So there is a little bit of timing. We still expect probably to be driving some efficiencies in R&D but there is some timing in Q1 that will come back in Qs two, three and four exactly. Operator : We have a question from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Josh Jennings - Cowen and Company : Just first I wanted to go back to the drug-eluting stent franchise in the U.S. and returning to growth mid-30s share. Can you just talk about the sustainability there, is there upside in terms of share gains from here versus some of the potential trialing that your competitors have called out? Michael F. Mahoney: Yes. So one is, we\u2019re pleased that we\u2019ve kind of recaptured the number one share position. We\u2019re also very sensitive to the pricing in this marketplace. So this is not a hold a number one share position at all cost position. We think we have a stronger portfolio and we can maintain price discipline and increase our market share with our portfolio. So if you look at the, one, we\u2019ve got a very strong commercial team. We have capabilities with our chronic total occlusion and imaging business that physicians are interested in that helped complement our DES portfolio. And we think, as you look for the future here, with our Promus PREMIER launch, which really is in full launch mode now and call it 18 months from now, potential launch of SYNERGY in fourth quarter \u201815 that we really are well positioned to have a - we\u2019re planning on a increasing gap in terms of our leadership in the U.S. with our portfolio. Josh Jennings - Cowen and Company : Great, and just one follow-up on the CRM side. Just with -- in terms of your high-voltage lead strategies with the recent announcement of U.S. ID for 7-French lines 4-FRONT, how are you thinking about building out that portfolio and any timelines in terms of when that lead could be approved? Michael F. Mahoney: So, this question regarding the new lead in the U.S.? Josh Jennings - Cowen and Company :  Yes. Michael F. Mahoney: So specifically around the new ICD, that\u2019s an 8-French lead, not 7. And that is being investigated as part of our NAVIGATE clinical trial, which is enrolling patients both to investigate our family of quad pole CRT-D leads, the ACUITY X-4 leads as well as the 4-FRONT device and that trial launched a little bit earlier this quarter and expect to complete enrolment in that trial around the end of next year. Operator : We have a question from the line of Bruce Nudell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse : Mike, just looking at the dynamics around the S-ICD. In one sense it\u2019s very positive in that you are expecting over 1% worldwide market share on a revenue basis. But just looking more granularly at the US, it looks like the MRG data says you are about 2 points under-represented in can share in the CRT-D segment relative to the overall share, but 5 points over-represented in the single chamber share. And so, is one of the moderating influences regarding the impact of S-ICD on overall share that people will just keep your single chamber share about the same but give you more representation in S-ICD, with a revenue uptick of course. But that\u2019s like kind of this share allocation strategy that these hospitals may have, if you could just comment on that? Michael F. Mahoney: Well, I think physicians and patients ultimately like to think we will choose the best product for the best patient. And we think that\u2019s what\u2019s driving our de novo share gains, which really is the hallmark of which platforms are most innovative. I think the new implants are being selected and we are being selected at an increasing rate because of our S-ICD capability. And we think we have a lot of momentum. We believe we\u2019ll gain a lot of momentum with this new MINI platform, which provides the thinnest device. So the notion of a physician rewarding us for that and then maybe hurting us or de-tracking us in CRT-D as a result of that gain, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a big play. I think the fact we\u2019ve had some portfolio gaps, we haven\u2019t had a CRT-D device, which is the premium priced product in the segment, we haven\u2019t had one and now we have it in Europe and we\u2019re able to provide a solution now in the U.S. and although it\u2019s not a solution, we\u2019re are offering the quad pole lead as well, we believe a number of physicians will mix and leverage our X4 can capability in CRT-D procedures. So there is a lot of service components embedded within the CRM business but we think ultimately a leading that\u2019s innovative will win and we are building that over time. Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse : And on a strategic basis, one of the things that\u2019s really kind of surprised me is the strength of TAVI results generally where it\u2019s proving superior to surgery in elderly, higher-risk patients. And that has connotations for its ultimate market size. And I think the skeptics of the market were pegging it more in the $2 billion range, the optimists were $3 billion. But it looks like there could be even upside to that. Have these results made you sit back a little bit and really think about the level of investment that Boston should be appropriating towards structural heart generally, especially given success -- early success at least in the mitral front? Michael F. Mahoney: Yes. Well, I\u2019ll turn that over to Dr. Keith Dawkins. Keith Dawkins : Bruce, I think we remain very bullish about the segment, particularly after the favorable superior ACC results recently presented. As you know, Lotus is a differentiated second-generation product and as you also know peri valve elite drives both early and late mortality and morbidity. We think the leak results from REPRISE II the CE Mark trial best-in-class and the six-month data from the REPRISE II will be presented next month at EuroPCR. So this is an area where we are investing heavily. The additional third valve size, the 25 millimeter valve, will be launched shortly and will be available for the REPRISE III U.S. pivotal IDE trial. So in answer to your question, we appreciate the increasing potential size of the market and are investing appropriately in this space. Operator : And we have a question from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Matthew Dodds - Citigroup: For BP, it looks like the Bard business, I know you talked about the legacy business declining, but I think the Bard business declined 10% as well, is that right and is that integration issues? Michael F. Mahoney: We have to get that exact number to you. The standalone Bard business declining 10% doesn\u2019t appear correct to me. So we will to verify with the group here. So our information was saying that the Bard integration has gone well, that the revenue gains are consistent with our financial model and more in the flattish range year-over- very. Quite frankly, the challenge has been more in the legacy EP business within Boston Scientific, which ex-Bard, was down slightly for the quarter. So I would tell the Bard business more flat and the legacy BSC business is low single digits. So I think overall that integration has gone well. As I mentioned the commercial teams have pulled together and we\u2019re really still in the very important time where we are pulling the key pieces there together. We\u2019ve talked about our IntellaTip MiFi therapeutic catheter, we\u2019ll gain an impact as we move towards the second half of the year. And we will have our first implementations of our Rhythmia navigation system. So that business will strengthen particularly in the second half of 2014 and be a more meaningful contributor in \u201815. Matthew Dodds - Citigroup: Just a quick one on emerging markets, if that\u2019s all right. You did better than peers this quarter. It sounds like in the commentary, Endoscopy, Urology, Other Interventional Cardiology were the big strengths, is that - are those the majority of it, or is there something I missed that also did really well? Michael F. Mahoney: We are putting increased emphasis on the diversification of our portfolio in the business you just mentioned in those emerging markets. There is less pricing pressure, there is excellent opportunity to train more physicians and to increase access and the three that you mentioned there are growing quite nicely. And so it\u2019s helping diversify our cardiovascular mix in those markets. Operator : We have a question from the line of Brooks West with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Brooks West - Piper Jaffray : Mike, I wanted to push you a little bit on the strategy with your quad generator in the United States, just to make sure I'm thinking about expectations correctly. Do you see that -- is there an opportunity to call on competitive accounts in your mind with that generator and actually try to take some share based on the differentiated features? Or is it primarily a protector for Boston Scientific labs against potential -- you know, you've got St. Jude and you've got Medtronic coming to the market in the near future. Michael F. Mahoney: I think it\u2019s both. We haven\u2019t offered, there hasn\u2019t been a competitive quad offering in the U.S. And physicians like -- in most hospitals like choices. So I think it will be - we\u2019ll target that customers who are users of BSC products broadly and customers who may not be users of BSC products, so I think it\u2019s great for the market to have a second offering. And this strategy has been really well proven out. There has been a number of cases in the past where even recently that we\u2019ve seen some competitive companies have some lead issues and you see companies or physicians that will mix and match say our leads with competitive devices or our device with competitive leads. So that is not a new phenomena within this business and it\u2019s been approved through rigorous testing and clinical performance by the FDA and I think the market will embrace a second choice in the quad offering and we will take it immediately to competitive accounts and to our current users. Brooks West - Piper Jaffray :  Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on other Interventional Cardiology, can you call out, is that mainly your imaging products and then remind us again your pipeline there? Don't you also have an FFR product coming to market soon? Michael F. Mahoney: Sure. The key drivers of our IC Other business would be our imaging business, our IVUS imaging business for sure and we\u2019ll be expanding into FFRs. I think -- I believe the first quarter of 2015 is the timing for our FFR launch, so that\u2019s a nice catalyst. The second one is our chronic total occlusion, which is the acquisition we did at BridgePoint a number of years ago, a couple of years ago and also we had a positive ruling legally and we\u2019ll be able to re-launch our Guidezilla guide catheter as we enter our second quarter here. So that should provide some additional tailwind to the Other Cardio business. Susan Lisa : Linda, we have time to take one more question please. Operator : Okay, thank you. We have a question from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : Just wanted to double check I guess your guidance for the full year including about 100 basis points plus from adjacencies, just in terms of whether or not -- I know that is what you said from last quarter as well but your confidence around that given what seems to be still a very slow progress on Alair and then the change in assumptions with Vessex. Then I have a follow-up after that. Daniel J. Brennan: Christian, it\u2019s Dan. Yes, I think as we called out in the prepared comments, the three biggest contributors to that 100 basis point, 100-plus basis points of growth will be Lotus, WATCHMAN and Alair, and that\u2019s still the plan and still that\u2019s included in our $7.3 billion to $7.5 billion guidance for the year. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : And then just on the margin front, you guys have commented that you still feel very confident in getting to the 25% operating margin goal in 2017. This quarter you saw a lower tax rate. It sounds like you didn't really change the tax rate guidance for the full year. But can you give us some level of appreciation in terms of the longer term if you can get to the 25% operating margin goal in 2017? What does the tax rate look like in that year? Daniel J. Brennan: So I think we\u2019ve gone out both this year and next year with 13% to 15%. I\u2019m very comfortable with that in terms of tax rate and actually we don\u2019t really give much guidance for \u201815, but we feel like the tax rate is an important one to give for that next year. Still feel good about the 25% operating income in 2017 and that would include whatever tax rate we\u2019re at at that point as well. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : What\u2019s the risk I guess that that nice improvement in operating margin over the next several years is really offset by a significantly higher tax rate? Daniel J. Brennan: I think if you look at the -- our comfort with the 25%, again, I wouldn\u2019t give anything beyond 2015 relative to any parts of the P&L, but still feel that the 25% is our goal for 2017 with all areas of the P&L contributing. Susan Lisa : Okay. With that, we\u2019d like to conclude the call. Thanks for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific.

We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our Web site under the heading, Financial Information. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will begin our prepared remarks with an update on our business progress and his perspectives on the quarter. Dan will then review our overall Q2 2014 financial results as well as guidance for full-year 2014 and the Q3 2014. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by Dr. Dawkins and Dr. Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share; new product approvals and launches; clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected use; our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q3 and full-year 2014 guidance; as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses.

These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike? Michael Mahoney : Thank you, Susie. Good morning everyone. Boston Scientific achieved strong results in second quarter, posting 4% operational sales growth and 17% adjusted EPS growth over the prior year period. This quarter's results increased our confidence in our outlook and we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year. We remain very confident and enthusiastic about our strategic plan as we execute on our growth initiatives and advance our pipeline. We believe that Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to drive sustainable double-digit EPS growth, given our global momentum, pipeline and significant opportunity for margin improvement. We are excited about our future as we continue to build throughout the business. We are in the very early innings of launching multiple new platforms that will strengthen the future of the company. These platforms target large disease states that impact patients globally. Such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke, sudden cardiac arrest, vascular disease, pulmonary disorders, Parkinson's disease, severe pain and cancer. Our differentiated pipeline that will be highlighted throughout the call represents a portfolio that delivers unique clinical benefits to patients and physicians while delivering economics savings to our customers. I will now provide some key highlights in the quarter and thoughts on our outlook. Dan will review the financials and 2014 guidance and then we will take your questions. So please note that in my remarks all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis, constant currency unless otherwise specified. So beyond the strong 4% operational sales growth and 17% adjusted EPS growth, I would like to go into some detail on four key highlights of the quarter. First, our diversified and balanced growth across the company. Second, our outperformance in cardiac rhythm management. Thirdly, our above market growth in interventional cardiology. And, fourth, our strong position in peripheral interventions. So starting with a big picture for BSC in the second quarter. Our performance represents strong, balanced global growth across divisions and geographies delivering 4% total company operational sales growth. We continue to execute our strategy to strengthen and diversify the portfolio in key segments while expanding geographically. MedSurg posted a solid growth of 5% with endoscopy just below that rate and continued above market growth in urology and women's health. We believe that our neuromodulation continues to grow faster than the market, however our growth slowed in the second quarter due to challenging year-over-year comparisons. These results plus solid cardiovascular sales and stronger rhythm management sales, all contributed to our overall 4% operational sales growth. Furthermore, we are executing our strategies to drive global expansion. In second quarter, in Europe we are up 7% and sales in the BRIC countries grew 19%. We continued to see strong returns on our investments in emerging markets as total emerging market sales are up 14% and now average 10% of total company's sales, a great improvement. Turning now to cardiac rhythm management. Sales grew a solid 4% on strong demand for our truly differentiated products. BSC offers a portfolio that now includes the world's only ICD that does not require leads in the heart, the world's smallest ICD, the most reliable leads and the world's longest lasting defibrillators. We are also encouraged by our 12-months operational sales trend in CRM with year-over-year sales growth of 2% for the trailing 12-months. So to provide further context, it was a very positive quarter for the S-ICD platform and other new product launches that will benefit our CRM business going forward. We continue to rollout S-ICD globally and for the full year 2014 we remain very comfortable with our target for S-ICD revenue contribution north of $75 million. From a reimbursement standpoint, we are pleased this quarter to have commercial insurers such as Coventry and HCSC, the Blue Cross, Blue Shield affiliate with over 12 million members in the west and Midwest, to now provide S-ICD coverage joining Health Net and others. In Electrophysiology, we began to launch the innovative Rhythmia Mapping and Navigation platform in the second half. And we expect to see improved performance in this business in fourth quarter and into the future with the Rhythmia launch, new catheter platforms and synergies from our broader cardiac rhythm management team. The third point. Moving on to cardiovascular. Interventional cardiology is building momentum and posted its second consecutive quarter of revenue growth due to strong Promus PREMIER and SYNERGY DES performance, improved sales execution and multiple new product launches outside of stents. We have moved back into the clear number one market share position in interventional cardiology DES in the U.S. We believe that we gained another 150 basis points of U.S. DES share in the quarter, exiting the second quarter in the high 30s on the strength of Promus PREMIER's performance. Globally in DES, we are pleased to expand our market leadership position in the U.S., return to growth in Europe, and also executing a successful premier launch in Japan. As a result, we estimate our worldwide DES share is up roughly 300 basis points from year-end 2013. And this is consistent with our prior guidance for BSC to be a net share gainer in global DES in 2014. Many of our interventional cardiology products and solutions are still on the very early phases of launch. Such as SYNERGY, our next generation bioabsorbable coated stent. LOTUS, our percutaneous aortic value and our POLARIS Imaging System for IVUS that will soon enable us to provide an integrated FFR offering. Regarding SYNERGY, we are excited the second quarter with a sales increase in over 15% of our DES revenue in Europe and nearly 30% of our mix in countries where SYNERGY has launched. Positive three-year follow-up SYNERGY data were presented at EuroPCR in May, demonstrating zero incidence of stent thrombosis at three years and a low 1.1% rate of target lesion revascularization at three years. We expect the pivotal EVOLVE II data to be released at AHA this November. In addition, our structural heart franchise continues to build momentum and strengthen internationally. We believe that six months post LOTUS TAVR launch, we are now the number three transfemoral aortic value company in Europe. Six months follow-up from our LOTUS REPRISE II CE Mark trial was presented at EuroPCR in May and demonstrated excellent results with 79.8% of patients demonstrating zero or trace para-valvular aortic regurgitation. To continue the momentum, we received CE Mark earlier this month for the 25 mm LOTUS value system which complements the previously available 23 mm and 27 mm sizes. We began the 1,000 patient response post-market registry in Europe in June and we look forward to initiating the REPRISE III U.S. IDE trial later this year in 2014. Also within structural heart, a brief update on WATCHMAN. Our left atrial appendage closure device designed to reduce the risk of stroke of patients with on-valvular atrial fibrillation. The FDA recently confirmed to us the third circulatory system devices panel will be convened on October 8 to review the WATCHMAN clinical evidence. As per our June update, we estimate a U.S. approval in the first half of 2015. BSC looks forward to presenting the totality of the data supporting the safety and efficacy for WATCHMAN in appropriately selected patients consistent with our proposed labeling. We look forward to the opportunity to expand patient access to this innovative stroke prevention treatment. Fourth, in our peripheral interventions business we took an important step to strengthen our global position and expand our capabilities with the May signing of a definitive agreement to acquire the interventional division of Bayer AG. Our internal R&D efforts also continue to deliver with the recent CE Mark and launch of the RANGER drug-coated balloon. The RANGER drug-coated balloon plus the future editions Bayer Interventional's thrombectomy and atherectomy platforms will enhance our ability to provide physicians and healthcare systems with a comprehensive portfolio of solutions to treat challenging vascular conditions. Also in the PI, an update on resistant hypertension. We consistently receive feedback in international markets on the unique benefits and differentiation of Vessex. This is our second generation, bipolar, multipoint renal denervation platform. We spent the last several months gathering input on our clinical strategy from multiple experts in the scientific community. This input has helped shaped our view of the new landscape of renal denervation while providing us with critical insights as we consider the next steps in our clinical program. So based on the inputs from your advisors and from recent meetings with the regulators and thought leaders, it has become clear that pursuing a global pivotal trial as previously designed is not the best approach. We expect to engage regulatory agencies in the coming weeks and we will proposed a revised study protocol in which our goal would be to isolate the effects of renal denervation while minimizing the challenges encountered in other trials due to the unpredictable effects of changes in medication and patient compliance. This is an innovative approach that we believe is the appropriate strategy given both the significant opportunity and near-term challenges in the renal denervation market. So moving to our operating margins. Our focus on margin improvement remains a critical imperative for the company in 2014 and throughout our strategic plan. In the second quarter despite higher plan spending to support various product launches and commercial programs, we held adjusted operating margin roughly flat sequentially and year-over-year and came in at the high-end of our second quarter adjusted operating margin guidance. Driving margin improvement remains an absolute top priority for our entire team. We also expect to continue to generate strong cash flow which will support an allocation of capital that is aligned with our strategic priorities while enabling us to maintain sufficient flexibility. So in summary, Boston Scientific is building momentum. We delivered a strong second quarter and first half 2014. We delivered operational revenue growth of 4% in the second quarter and leveraged that to 17% adjusted EPS growth. We are on track to deliver our full year 2014 operational sales guidance of 3% to 5% and we expect to drive roughly 100 basis points of operating margin improvement and leverage our sales growth to drive double-digit EPS growth as we believe there is ample room for improved operating performance across many of our businesses and regions. Furthermore, our strategic plan is compelling. It's achievable and we believe that it will deliver strong value to BSC shareholders. Finally and most importantly, I will like to thank our employees for their winning spirit, their performance in the first half, and their relentless commitment to Boston Scientific. Now let me turn the call over to Dan for a more detailed review of our financials and 2014 guidance. Daniel Brennan : Thanks, Mike. I will start with some overall perspective on the quarter before diving into the details. We generated adjusted EPS of $0.21 compared to $0.18 in Q2 of 2013 and exceeded our guidance range of $0.18 to $0.20. The improved performance in Q2 was driven by operational revenue growth, lower royalty expense and a lower than expected tax rate. In addition, this quarter saw a lower R&D spend which was down 130 basis points year-over-year due to the timing of some projects and a focus R&D efficiency. These improvements were partially offset by SG&A spend related to investments in our strategic growth initiatives and core product launches. Despite a higher adjusted SG&A rate this quarter, we posted an adjusted operating margin of 19.8% which was at the high end of our Q2 guidance range of 19% to 20% and roughly flat both year-over-year and sequentially. We remain highly focused on reducing spend and believe we are on track to achieve our profitability goal of roughly of roughly 100 plus basis points of annual operating margin improvement, which will result in a adjusted operating margin approaching 20% for the full year 2014. Below the operating income line, a $4.1 million net gain on investments and a slightly lower than expected effective tax rate along with a 1% reduction in shares outstanding from a year ago also contributed to adjusted EPS of $0.21 or a 17% year-over-year adjusted earnings per share growth. In addition, we generated adjusted free cash flow of $262 million and operating cash flow of $286 million in the quarter. We continue to execute against our goal of consistent revenue growth and believe we are uniquely positioned to leverage that growth to double-digit adjusted earnings growth. Now I will provide a detailed review of our Q2 business performance and operating results. For the second quarter of 2014, consolidated revenue of $1.873 billion represented operational revenue growth of 4% compared to the prior year period which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the divested neurovascular business. Revenue grew 4% year-over-year on an as reported basis as well. The acquisition of the C.R. Bard electrophysiology business contributed roughly 135 basis points of growth in the quarter. So operational revenue growth excluding the acquired Bard EP business was 3% year-over-year. The foreign exchange impact on sales was a $5 million tailwind in the quarter compared to the prior year period in line with what we assumed in our guidance range. I will now provide details on the revenue results for our seven divisions which roll up into our three business groups. I will start with MedSurg where total group sales of $580 million grew 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and group adjusted operating income remained stable at 30.2%. Urology and women's health worldwide sales grew 7% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior quarter. Physician training, product registrations and commercial investment in key international geographies fueled strong international performance. In addition to all international regions growing double-digits for the fourth consecutive quarter, the U.S. business returned to growth in Q2 and continues to have very attractive margin. Endoscopy sales grew 4% worldwide year-over-year on a constant currency basis as five of our eight franchises in this division posted growth. Latin America was particularly strong growing 21% year-over-year on a constant currency basis offset by weakness in Japan. To close out the MedSurg results, our worldwide neuromodulation business grew 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. We signaled last quarter, changes to Medicare reimbursement for physician office trialing of spinal cord stimulation systems went into effect this year and has negatively impacted market growth in Q2. As physicians adjust their practice patterns, we believe the market may reset this year to reflect the new reimbursement environment. In addition, Q2 marks the one-year anniversary of our Precision Spectra launch, creating tougher comparisons. After growing over 30% in the second half of last year, our neuromodulation business will face increasingly difficult comparisons for the remainder of 2014 but we believe this will still be a growing market and our goal is to grow faster than this market given the strength of our technology and our team. Turning now to the cardiovascular group which consists of the interventional cardiology and peripheral interventions divisions. Global sales for the group totaled $739 million and grew 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis for the second consecutive quarter. Cardiovascular group adjusted operating margins for the quarter of 26.1% represented 100 basis point improvement year-over-year. Within cardiovascular, worldwide interventional cardiology sales of $528 million grew 1% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. On the strength of the Promus PREMIER DES launch, we believe we expanded DES market leadership in the U.S. with $128 million in sales and an estimated high 30s market share. Globally, DES sales grew 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. U.S. DES sales grew 10% while sales internationally grew 1% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. DES revenue in Europe grew 1% year-over-year on a constant currency basis but excluding Germany, European DES sales were 8% higher than last year. Recall that we still have one more quarter before we anniversary the temporary injunction in Germany that resulted in a missed cycle of tenders. We continued to execute our three tier strategy and increase our mix of synergy in select markets. Asia's DES results were flat year-over-year on a constant currency basis, a reflection of share gains on the strength of the Promus PREMIER Japan launch and the April 1, biannual reimbursement cut. Moving beyond DES I will now address our other IC performance. Within other IC, IVUS grew 7% and core IC grew 2%, both on a constant currency year-over-year basis. Total other IC declined 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis largely due to weakness in bare-metal stents ahead of our REBEL bare-metal stent launch in the U.S. which we announced earlier this week. Overall, we believe our strategy to provide the interventional cardiologist with a broadest portfolio of technology to treat the most complex coronary cases is resonating with physicians and driving above market growth in worldwide interventional cardiology. In structure heart, which includes our LOTUS percutaneous valve and WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure device. LOTUS posted solid sequential growth on a constant currency basis off a small base and WATCHMAN continued its strong growth with revenue up 30% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Peripheral interventions delivered revenue of 3% over the prior year period on a constant currency basis. U.S. growth of 6% year-over-year was led by strength in the interventional oncology franchise. Partially offsetting this weakness was Asia where we saw some procedural softness, particularly in Japan. We remain on track to close the Bayer interventional deal in the second half of the year. Finally I will discuss our rhythm management group which consists of electrophysiology and cardiac rhythm management divisions. Worldwide, rhythm management sales in Q2 of $553 million grew 7% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Rhythm management's adjusted operating margin for Q2 of 12.2% represents 130 basis point improvement year-over-year and continues to be an area of key focus. Worldwide electrophysiology revenue grew 54% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Excluding the acquired Bard EP business, global EP revenue declined in the quarter. Looking ahead, the launch of our Rhythmia mapping and navigation system and further integration of the Bard EP acquisition will significantly expand our product portfolio and commercial capabilities. For the cardiac rhythm management division, Q2 worldwide sales increased 4% on a constant currency basis year-over-year. Growth in CRM was broad base as the U.S. grew 3%, Europe grew 4% and Asia grew 5%, all year-over-year on a constant currency basis. As Mike detailed, we continue to see strong demand for the S-ICD and feel very comfortable with the goal of $75 million plus in revenue for the year for 2014. On a worldwide basis, defib sales of $355 million were up 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. U.S. defib revenue posted solid growth of 5% driven by continued S-ICD momentum and the rollout of our MINI ICD and our X4 quad pulse generator, both of which launched in the U.S. in the second half of the quarter. Worldwide pacer sales were up 6% on a constant currency basis year-over-year totaling $142 million. We continue to see strong adoption of our INGENIO family of pacemakers which drove international year-over-year growth of 15% on a constant currency basis. We believe our o-U.S. pacer business continued to gain share in the quarter. We were also very encouraged with our worldwide CRM results in Q2 and would like to reiterate our belief that CRM trends are best analyzed over multiple quarters. And as Mike highlighted on a rolling 12-month basis, our CRM business posted 2% constant currency growth which we believe outpaced the market. Turning now to the P&L, adjusted gross profit margin for the second quarter was 70.3% or 50 basis points lower than the prior year quarter. Recall that Q2 2013 gross margin included a 90 basis point benefit from the final true-up related to our Promus profit share agreement. Excluding this onetime benefit, GM this quarter was 40 basis points higher than Q2 of last year. The increase was largely attributable to benefits from our value improvement programs as well as some benefit from the neurovascular divestiture, partially offset by price erosion. We believe we are on track to deliver adjusted gross margin in our range of 70% to 71% for the full year. Once again the impact of foreign exchange upon gross margin was minimal as a result of our hedging program. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $715 million or 38.2% of sales in the quarter. This represents a 230 basis point increase in SG&A spending as a percentage of revenue compared to Q2 2013 due to higher spend to support product launches and commercial programs. However, we are not satisfied with the overall SG&A expend and are taking steps to reduce it. Adjusted research and development expenses were $206 million in the second quarter or 11% of sales. As a percent of sales, this represents 130 basis point decline in year-over-year spending due to efficiency gains and the timing of projects. As an example of these efficiency gains, our recently CE Mark drug-coated balloons, RANGER for the peripheral market and AGENT for the coronary market, resulted from a very lean development process. We leverage capabilities across both our PI and IC divisions as well as the technological expertise of a partner who is a recognized leader in coating technology and brought these technologies to market for considerably less cost than in the past. While we continue to look for more of these types of opportunities, we expect to return to a more normalized rate of R&D spend in the second half of this year. Royalty expense was $25 million in the quarter or 1.3% of sales, down 130 basis points year-over-year due to a more favorable than expected royalty structure. As we continue to focus on costs savings opportunities, we have a number of royalty arrangements and regularly look to renegotiate them. We expect our royalty rate in the second half of 2014 to be relatively flat to the second half of 2013. On an adjusted basis, pretax operating income was $371 million in the quarter or 19.8% of sales, roughly flat both sequentially and year-over-year. GAAP operating loss which includes GAAP to adjusted items of $440 million, was $69 million in Q2 2014. I would like to add context to two of these items. First, a $110 million intangible asset impairment charge, the majority of which is related to our Vessex acquisition, resulting from our clinical strategy change that Mike outlined. There is also a portion related to WATCHMAN due to revised expectations and timing as a result of the upcoming third FDA advisory panel. Second, $267 million in litigation related net charges are primarily related to increase in our transvaginal surgical mesh product liability reserves. As a reminder, our reserves cover both known and estimated future cases in claims asserted against us as well as cost of defense. Our total accrual for all legal matters of which mesh is included, was $825 million as of June 30, 2014. Now I will move on to other income and expense which primarily consisted of interest expense. Net interest expense for the quarter was $52.6 million as compared to $61.7 million in Q2 last year, due primarily to the refinancing of our public debt in Q3 of 2013. Our average interest expense rate in the quarter was 4.8% or approximately 90 basis points lower than Q2 last year. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 103.7% on a reported basis due in part to the intangible asset impairments and litigation related charges that negatively impacted reported pretax income. Our tax rate was 9.7% on adjusted basis. This low rate continues to reflect the expected geographic mix of our profits. The difference between our reported and adjusted tax rates for the quarter is attributed to charges excluded in determining our non-GAAP results. Finally, Q2 2014 adjusted EPS of $0.21 per share represents 17% year-over-year growth. As mentioned, included in the adjusted EPS calculation is an approximate $20 million lower royalty expense. On a reported GAAP basis, Q2 2014 EPS was breakeven and included net charges and amortization expense totaling $281 million. This decline compared to Q2 2013 GAAP earnings of $0.10 per share, largely reflects the aforementioned intangible asset impairment charges and litigation related charges, partially offset by benefits related to contingent consideration. Moving on to the balance sheet. DSO of 63 days decreased one day compared to June of 2013, due primarily to strong collections in the U.S. and Europe. Days inventory on hand of 153 days was up 9 days compared to June of last year and up 5 days compared to December of 2013 due to higher inventory in advance of launches, primarily Promus PREMIER, the S-ICD, MINI and X4 and lower cost of goods sold driven primarily by standard cost improvements and a favorable product mix. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $262 million, compared to $388 million in Q2 2013. This decrease is primarily due to investments in inventory to support new product launches. We continue to expect our full year 2014 adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $1.2 billion with stronger free cash flow generation than second half. Capital expenditures were $64 million in the quarter compared to $51 million in the same quarter last year. There were no share repurchases in the quarter as we issued a net cash payment of $65 million to acquire the remaining 72% of IoGyn and announce our intent to acquire the interventional division of Bayer AG for $415 million. We value returning cash to shareholders and any continuation of our share repurchase program in 2014 would be subject to business development opportunities, market conditions, our stock performance, regulatory trading windows and other factors. I\u2019d like to conclude with our guidance for Q3 and the full-year 2014. For the full-year 2014, we expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $7.325 billion to $7.425 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 3% to 5% operationally and 3% to 4% on a reported basis. We continue to expect foreign exchange to be a net neutral for the full year 2014. We now expect adjusted EPS for the full-year 2014 to be in a range of $0.79 to $0.83, and we encourage you to model to the midpoint of the range. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.28 to $0.32. Although it will be necessary to make tradeoffs within the P&L in any given time period, we remain focused on achieving our goal of at least 100 basis points of annual adjusted operating margin improvement and reaching an overall 25% operating margin by 2017. We believe that our strategies and programs to improve profitability are succeeding and we remain on track to achieve our goal. Now turning to Q3 2014. We expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $1,790 million to $1,840 million. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the tailwind from FX should be approximately $10 million or 60 basis points relative to Q3 last year. On an operational basis, we expect consolidated Q3 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of plus 3% to plus 5%. For the third quarter, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.18 to $0.20 per share and reported GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.08 to $0.10 per share. I encourage you to check our investor relations Web site for Q2 2014 financial and operational highlights which outlines Q2 results and 2014 guidance and will welcome your feedback. So with that I will turn it back to Susie who will moderate the Q&A. Susan Lisa : Thanks, Dan. Linda, let's open it up for questions for the next 30 minutes or so. Linda, please go ahead. Operator : (Operator Instructions) We do have a question from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets : Very, very strong ICD quarter. And I'm just wondering if you can provide a little bit more color with respect to the U.S.? Was the better than expected results driven by quad can and S-ICD? And then I had a follow-up on the revenue guidance for the year. Michael Mahoney : Good morning, Glenn. Yes, we do expect a lot out of that business and we are really pleased with our performance broadly in CRM and in U.S. in particular. Also as Dan highlighted, we really do look at the business on an ongoing basis and the 12-month trend is a plus 2%. We got a lot of heat in the first quarter for a down quarter but over the 12 months it's up 2% and up 4% in the second quarter. You know some of the biggest contributors to that, you highlighted a few, one is a very strong S-ICD momentum. We have a lot of confidence that we will exceed the $75 million target that we gave for the year. And also just the richness of the pipeline that we are delivering in the U.S. with our MINI which is -- the device is about 20% smaller than competitive devices. A lot of uptake by physicians and patients with that product. It represents a significant part of our mix. We are also gaining some nice benefit globally with our quad platform and in the U.S. with the recent approval of the X4 quad generator. So we have a lot of positive news with our pipeline. We offer physicians significant differentiation and our commercial teams are delivering. Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets : And what is early feedback on the quad can? Because I know in the quarter that was launched more in kind of later in the quarter in June. Are you seeing EPs gravitate towards the product? Our research tells us that docs do indeed mix and match a lot more than maybe what we historically know. And is this what's also helping to drive the, what drove the better than expected results in 2Q and going forward. Michael Mahoney : Yes, it's certainly a part of the equation. You know in Europe we offer the full lead and generator for a quad solution which certainly strengthens our portfolio in Europe. And in the U.S. we do see physicians that are going to mix and match the generator with the leads and they have traditionally done that in other instances as well. And so physicians enjoy the longevity that we offer. Additional pacing vector that\u2019s offered versus competitive systems. And we are seeing that as an opportunity to break into competitive accounts as well as to secure CRT-D business that we may have lost without this offering in the past. So it's certainly a part of the equation of our improved growth. Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. And then just quickly, Dan, on the revenue guidance that you offered. Does that include the Bayer acquisition because by our map we thought that would, probably by the fourth quarter contribute $20 million-$30 million. Daniel Brennan : Glenn, it does not. Since we haven't closed that deal, we have not included that in our guidance for the second half of 2014. Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. But if we threw $20 million or $30 million into our model in the foreclosure, is that a reasonable range? Daniel Brennan : It all depends when you assume a closure. I mean as we have said, it was $120 million business within Bayer. So $10 a month and whatever you assume from close date, that would seem reasonable. Operator : We have a question from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan: Can I start with the SG&A line, because you ended up with obviously so much higher than you guided at the end of the first quarter? So if you could spend some more time on that? Daniel Brennan : Sure, Mike, happy to. Some of that is expected because we do have a seasonality effect where we have heavier trade show activity as you would know in the second quarter. We do have launch spend. So the Promus PREMIER launch happened a little early then we expected in Japan and we had all the series of launches that Mike went through relative to CRM. Some of it's more unexpected. We do -- as our IRS case moves out further relative to ultimately resolution, we have more fees associated with that. And we do take opportunistic opportunities to look at investments in Europe and emerging markets to drive revenue. So all that, you know some expected and some unexpected. But I would agree, we look at it and not happy with the 38.2% and we would look for that to come down in the back half of '14 and into '15. Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan: And the degree at which it looks like it's -- I'm just looking at it relative to your guidance. The degree to which it looks like it surprised you for the quarter? The tax expense [couldn\u2019t] (ph) be part of that. Why do you think it was so much higher than what you guys thought it would be at the end of the first quarter? Michael Mahoney : Yes, it's Mike. I wouldn\u2019t say it surprised us. Dan talked about some legal matters we are working through. But we are very confident we will deliver on our full year guidance for SG&A in that 36.5% to 37.5% range. So we are very comfortable with that in the back half. And as we talked about before, with the sales growing, the guidance of 3% to 5%, the ability to drive the operating income margin improvement. And we believe this will be the high point of our SG&A in the second quarter. As we drive down to our guidance for the full year we will drive double-digit EPS growth. So I wouldn\u2019t say it's a big surprise for us. It's well planned. We have a lot of important launches and you are going to see the SG&A rate to creep down in the second half of the year. Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan: Okay. Let me step back from the quarter, Mike, and ask you strategically. Obviously there's been a lot of activity in the healthcare sector over the course of the last several months. Can you just share with us your updated thoughts on the bigger industry consolidation? It's not just consolidations but it's M&A activity, all designed to try and create shareholder value. Can you just talk about how you think M&A plays in Boston Scientific's strategy? And whether you think the healthcare, I wouldn't say competitive landscape, I'd say the healthcare landscape is shifting and whether your strategy alters at all, given some of the deals that have been announced? Michael Mahoney : Absolutely. Good question. And I would say the recent highly publicized acquisitions that you have read are certainly interesting news. But I would say in general it certainly does not impact our outlook in '14 nor do we see it impacting our strategic plan and our initiatives in any significant way. I think what's important for investors and employees is that the company is delivering today. We are building momentum and we have a strategic plan that\u2019s compelling. It's attainable. We are ahead of the investor day presentation that we provided 18 months ago. And I think more importantly, in our existing markets that we play in today, we play in very big markets well in excess of $30 billion, and we have ample opportunity to grow share in those businesses. And when we think about how we compete, we want to be the preferred innovative, clinical leader in very large disease states. And we have seven of those businesses today. So we will continue to provide tuck-in acquisitions and the right innovation bets to be really clinically differentiated and have scale in those specific disease states. And I think you are seeing the benefit of that strategy with our second quarter performance and the guidance we are reinforcing for the year. So I think the news is interesting but I think the plan that we have in place is very differentiated in the medtech. The ability to grow at or faster than our peer group and the ability that we have we believe to drive margin improvements faster, given the low base that the margins are currently at, which will drive consistent sustainable double-digit EPS growth. So it's really newsworthy but we believe the strategy we have in place is very sound and compelling for investors. Operator : We have a question from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead. Rick Wise - Stifel Nicolaus : Mike, you turned in a really healthy EU drug-eluting stent performance, up 8% excluding Germany. A couple of questions. Help us understand when those German tenders occur? And does this have positive implications you'd hope for '15? Does it help us in '14? Maybe a little color there. Number two, maybe you could update us on SYNERGY? I'm assuming in particular SYNERGY is doing well? You had some favorable comments. How do we think about the SYNERGY opportunity now with the U.S. trial enrollment? And maybe in particular we saw some commentary out of Europe with the GHOST-EU Registry that showed very high thrombosis rates for bioabsorbables and this meshes frankly with commentary we heard at PCR about high thrombosis rates. Help us think through the competitive environment for your business broadly and SYNERGY specifically? Thanks. Michael Mahoney : Sure. I will make some comments on our DES performance and what's driving that and then I will have Dr. Dawkins come in on your second part on the clinical aspects of some of the competitive implications. So just overall, our cardiology team has put ourselves in a very strong position with our global portfolio. And we are seeing the benefit of that in Europe today with our three-tier offering that Dan outlined. SYNERGY, we are very careful with how we price SYNERGY. It's a highly differentiated platform. And so today that mix is growing. But it currently approaches about 30% of our mix where we have launched it. So we are very careful with the pricing on this, as I said. And we have excellent three-tiered portfolio in Europe and it's surrounded by other unique benefits that we have. We just received approval for a new platinum-chromium bare-metal stent for chronic total occlusion. So a lot of investments in the cardiovascular field starting to pay off. So good progress in Europe. And in the U.S., we are really excited about what's happening in the U.S. We grew estimated 10% in the U.S. in DES in the quarter of the heals of Promus PREMIER. And also in Japan we are launching Promus PREMIER really as we speak here. So there is lot of good momentum and then as you look forward, we expect the pivotal SYNERGY data from EVOLVE II in our U.S. IDE trial will be released to AHA in November. So we look forward to the coming of SYNERGY in the U.S., probably late '15. So good work by the cardiovascular team and a pretty rich pipeline that we are kind of tearing out globally. So maybe Dr. Dawkins can comment on your other questions. Keith Dawkins : Thanks, Rick. I will just say a few words on the first generation bioresorbable vascular scaffold. As you know in the last few months, the recent literature has been has been replete with BVS complications including sub-optimal performance, mal-absorption, fracture displacement, stent thrombosis restenosis, myocardial infarction, and death. And last week in EuroIntervention Online was published the GHOST-EU Registry of BVS, which is the largest European registry, more than 1100 patients. And what caught our attention was the 3.4% annualized death from probable stent thrombosis rate. To put that, that was a one year, and to put that in perspective, the SYNERGY stent thrombosis rate of three years is zero percent admittedly in a more simple patient population. If we just dig down into these stent thrombosis, 87% of these patients were on dual antiplatelet therapy, 13% died and 55% suffered an acute myocardial infarction. So even the editor of that journal who as you know is a big BVS supported, cautioned in a short editorial that this may raise note of caution over the unselected use of BVS in an old comers population or as a workhorse stent. And as a clinician, I want to imply what is best for my patients. And frankly, the 3.4% one year stent thrombosis rate is just not acceptable. So we will obviously, as Mike said, look very carefully and we are very excited by the pivotal EVOLVE data of the SYNERGY stent which will be presented at AHA, more than 1,800 patients. And then that will be followed by a very large diabetic sub-study. So because of the very early strut coverage of SYNERGY and the fact the polymer in the drug disappear abluminaly within a few months, and we have seen already a PCR two-month OCT data showing strut coverage. We are very confident that we will do well in terms of stent thrombosis and obviously the acute performance is impressive. In terms of BVS, we note a low single-digit EU market penetration and that\u2019s the fact that CE Mark was achieved for the product three and half year ago. And I think that compares strikingly with what we are doing with SYNERGY. Rick Wise - Stifel Nicolaus : A quick follow-up question. On LOTUS you've got the 25 mm approved. Mike, you have 23, 25, 27, the full size complement. How do we think about the LOTUS ramp from here? And will we see data with the 25 mm valve at some point that shows a lower pacer rate than we saw in the REPRISE II data in Paris? Thanks. Michael Mahoney : Yes. So certainly that data will come out over time once the value has been launched. Maybe Keith you want to comment on the clinical implications? Keith Dawkins : Yes. So, Rick the 25 is being incorporated in the RESPOND Post Market study. That\u2019s the 1000 patient post market study which just started in Europe and is on track. And we know from the REPRISE II data that more than 50% of patients who needed pacing, there was significant overstretch. In other words, a 27 was put in when the 25 should have been put it but was not available, or a 23 was put in when a 21 should have been put in but was not available. So we are optimistic with the pacemaker rate. We will fall in the RESPONSE study with the addition of the 25 mm and we are working internally on a 21 and 29 mm. When comparing different devices as you know the range of sizes, the aortic, annually that you can cover with different devices is different but we think 29 back to 21 will cover the range. Operator : And we have a question from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : So two questions, one for Dan and then one for Mike. And Dan just to start out on the tax rate. Obviously that stuck out this quarter as quite low, and I'm just wondering for the rest of 2014 if you've upped your EPS guidance a little bit here. How much of that is due to the lower tax rate? Daniel Brennan : Yes. I think with where we are through the middle of the year, I think we will be comfortable with a 12 to 14 range for this year rather than the 13 to 15 that we had. So we probably see 100 basis point improvement relative to what we had previously signaled on tax. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : And did that drive the EPS increase or are there one or two other things that are helping? Daniel Brennan : It obviously helps but there are a lot of other things that help, most notably including a 3% to 5% growth rate in revenue in the third quarter and overall for the full year. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : Okay. And then, Mike, sort of a bigger picture question on revenue guidance relative to some of the long-term thoughts you put out there in 2013. You've had a couple of setbacks in left atrial appendage and hypertension and I'm just wondering if you're still confident in those long-term financial guidance that you provided last year relative to some of these challenges that you've seen? And then also more specifically 2014, is that 100 basis point guidance still stand relative to adjacencies or is that a little lower just because of the timing of WATCHMAN? Michael Mahoney : Yes, good question. So we are proud that our team is delivering on the commitments we gave despite some of those you have mentioned with hypertension and also the delays in Atritech, which we are hopeful that product will be approved in the first half of '15. But we are still delivering on the commitments that we made and ahead of the commitments that we talked about at the investor day. So I think a couple of things that are really in our favor. Our quad business is really executing nicely. We continue to see a steady performance and a lot of upside in our MedSurg businesses growing above market and strong market positions. A lot of international growth. So we expect continued strong performance there. And cardiovascular business, I won't go through every -- repeat the script here, but we have had a second quarter growth in drug-eluting stents and we are having increased momentum with TAVR. And our rhythm management business is strengthening despite the underperformance of our EP division. So we expect that to improve. So overall despite some of the slippage in the adjacencies -- and you are right, the impact to adjacencies will be less in '14 given the delays of WATCHMAN. But overall, the core business is executing stronger and our business globally is executing very well. Emerging markets growth is up over 15%, represent 10% of the company. So we have a balanced growth across the company and we have a number of also additional tailwinds Dr. Dawkins talked about in the drug-eluting market, as well as some other exciting launches and the uptake of S-ICD. Operator : We have a question from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Lewis - Morgan Stanley : Mike, just to think about, or for Dan, the revenue guidance for the year obviously moved around a little bit, perhaps $20 million-$25 million at the midpoint. Just operationally as you think about the year, maybe sort of talk through maybe what drove some of those changes. And then also secondarily, on the endo business, obviously we're accustomed to that seeing much stronger results for the company over the last two to three years. Any specific things you talk about here in the particular quarter as it relates to endo and traction you're expecting for the remainder of the year in that business? Daniel Brennan : Thanks, David. I think as you look at the growth -- and it's part of what Mike had just answered. So we have taken WATCHMAN out for the back half of the year as we anticipate approval for the first half of '15. So obviously absorb that but still delivering on the 3% to 5% for the full year. So it's really just tweaking around the edges to tighten the range as we go through the rest of the year. But still feel like that 3% to 5%, that zone we went in for the first half of this year, pulled through for the back half of the year as well for a lot of the reasons that Mike just outlined in the answer to the last question. Michael Mahoney : And just in terms of the endoscopy business, it's not a concern for us. That business is very healthy. We did have a slow, little bit of a slowdown in the second quarter. We had some key product launches that will likely shift to late third quarter, fourth quarter. But overall, we don\u2019t see on a year-over-year basis, any anticipated slowdown with our endoscopy performance. David Lewis - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And then Dan maybe just to follow up quickly on SG&A. One thing we saw in the fourth quarter last year was sort of the reinvestment to take advantage of some of this tax potentially. Is that sort of what we're seeing again here in the second quarter? Just you are being a little opportunistic given you have a little more flexibility, or is this really just one-time spending here and there that you expect to resolve and maintain your guidance for the year? Daniel Brennan : Yes. No, and that\u2019s a good question. I think first just to clarify relative to the overall. The 38.2% that I mentioned, that\u2019s the adjusted SG&A rate, which is the rate for the quarter. As you look at being opportunistic, we will always be opportunistic within a given quarter if we see opportunity but as Mike mentioned earlier, we are still laser focused on delivering on the operating profit targets that we have. So we will make tradeoffs between gross margin, SG&A and R&D, but still very focused on the operating margin targets and the double-digit EPS growth. Operator : We have a question from the line of Bruce Nudell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse : Mike, just looking at the two quarters back-to-back, 1Q and 2Q, for the S-ICD or for the ICD franchise. I mean, should we be -- and I know there are puts and takes. There's the replacement headwind, there's the quad situation. Should we be thinking about this year as kind of having a masking effect on the progress you're really making and maybe 50 to 100 basis points in worldwide share? And that the real full impact of the transformation in CRM or the ICD franchise really not being evident fully till something like 2016, where you have your own CRT-D product, full system product in the market? Michael Mahoney : Yes, I think that\u2019s a fair way to characterize it. I think we are very comfortable in stating that we are gaining share in de novo ICD. So physicians are choosing our platform portfolio more often. And as you said that success has been hampered by not having a full launch of a quad system which we now have in Europe but we don\u2019t have that quite yet in the U.S. And the replacement headwind -- you know quite frankly due to some of the battery longevity benefits that we deliver. So we think that replacement headwind will taper and right itself in 2016. So we are facing those two headwinds and that\u2019s being offset with positive growth due to the strong de novo ICD momentum and patient momentum that we have. So in the future, once neutralized for that replacement headwind and the full launch of quad, would better show the strength of the portfolio that we are delivering. I think if you look to Europe, we do have the portfolio today. We have the full quad capabilities, the S-ICD. We are battling the replacement headwind, at least the overall position is stronger in Europe given that trend. Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse : And I guess a follow-up for my good friend, Keith. Just looking at the PREVAIL results and the body of evidence, really doesn't look like there's any smoking gun in LAA and everybody's very confused by the need for a third panel. And the only thing that really strikes me is that the great utility of this technology would be in patients who are both at high stroke and bleeding risk. And that trial has never been done where people who are truly contraindicated for anticoagulants are tested, but they're having registries that speak to that. I mean are we on the right track in thinking that it's really an indication question that the FDA may have and that the compendium of evidence really speaks to safety even in anticoagulant intolerant patients? Keith Dawkins : Thanks, Bruce. I think I should pass that comment to my colleague, Ken Stein, who is CMO of the CRM division. Because WATCHMAN lodges in that division and Ken has been spending a few minutes on the forthcoming panel. Ken Stein : Yes, thanks. Thanks a lot Keith and thanks for the question, Bruce. We are really not able to get into any public details about our ongoing negotiations with FDA or speak for them in terms of what their concerns are that led to us go to this unprecedented third panel. I can tell you again, our belief is that the data as it exists today is still supportive of and consistent with the data that we presented to the panel last December. And that got us the overwhelmingly positive 13 to 1 votes in favor of safety, efficacy and positive benefit risk for the populations that have been studied in the large randomized trial. I think the only other thing I might want to clarify just in terms of your question, you know it's our belief that if you look into the populations that were studied in, PREVAIL and PROTECT and our two registries, CAP and CAP 2. Those are populations at high risk of stroke and those are population with high bleeding risk based on their CHADS VASc scores and their HAS-BLED scores. So we think that the populations that we studied and the indications that we are seeking really are the appropriate populations for this device. Operator : We have a question from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. David Brill - Wells Fargo Securities : This is David Brill for Larry. So first, second half 2014 EPS guidance, looked like it was $0.38 to $0.42. You know why would second half be lower than $0.41 in the first half? Daniel Brennan : The biggest piece of that is seasonality. Q3, particularly in Europe is the slowest sales quarter of the year. So you lose a little bit of sales, the industry loses sales in the third quarter. So that\u2019s the primary driven as to why the second half is lower. David Brill - Wells Fargo Securities : Great. And second, you talked about some of the headwinds in neuromodulation. Can you give us a little bit of color about how we should think about the neuromodulation in the U.S. going forward? Michael Mahoney : Sure. So in neuromodulation the business continues to do well. We did have -- we highlighted in the call, a slowdown in the second quarter and we anticipate a slowdown in the second half, given the annual comps. You the comparables in the second half of the year will be against a 30% growth comp. So that will be a challenge for us in the second half of the year but we still delivered positive growth in the second quarter despite some of those reimbursement changes. So as we look forward in the future, we do expect this to be a continued strong mid to high single digit growth market and we have a lot of innovation that we are launching out. The Spectra platform and more things in the pipeline that we will outline at investor day in the first quarter in '15. So our growth will slow down in the second half given those comparables. But as we anniversary those comps in '15 and strengthen the pipeline in a market that we believe that will settle into the kind of mid-single digit to high-single digit growth rate, we expect to outperform the market. Susan Lisa : Linda, there is time for one more please. Operator : Okay. Thank you. We do have a question from the line of Brooks West with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Brooks West - Piper Jaffray : Thanks for fitting me in. One on CRM. Can you update us on where you are with the NAVIGATE X-4 trial and kind of how we should think about that impacting your ICD results? And then I had a follow-up on cardiology. Michael Mahoney : Dr. Stein, you want to take that question? Ken Stein : Yes. I mean I don\u2019t -- the NAVIGATE trial is on pace, we are still projecting U.S. approval of our quad pole leads in 2016. I don\u2019t think that the fact that the trial is running has any material effect on the financial results that we have reported for the year. Brooks West - Piper Jaffray : Okay. But, Ken, you do get revenue from the trial, correct? Ken Stein : I am going to have to refer it to Dan on how that actually gets booked into the P&L. Daniel Brennan : Yes, Brooks. Yes, but nothing that\u2019s materially going to move the needle. So I wouldn\u2019t factor it into your model. Brooks West - Piper Jaffray : Okay. Great. And I guess my follow-up is on some of the other cardiology products. You know you have got IVUS FFR, you have now got a coronary drug-eluting balloon. You still got I think good momentum in the CTO device. Can you talk about the ability of those devices or maybe quantify a little bit the ability of that other bucket of stuff to impact the cardiology franchise going forward? Daniel Brennan : Sure, I can take that Brooks. The other IC, and again it's almost a shame to call it the other IC because there is so many good products in that category. But the products that we have in that to treat the complex PCI have significantly contributed to the overall IC franchise and actually to the company. Because if you recall, that\u2019s a franchise that was going backwards in prior years. And now that that has forward momentum and it's not just one product. It's IVUS, you just saw we announced the new bare-metal stent launch in CTO devices, Rotablator. There is a list of products in there that are all rejuvenated from a product portfolio perspective and contributing to growth in that franchise as well as IC. I don\u2019t know, Keith, if you have might any other comment as well. Keith Dawkins : You know I think, Brooks, also these are areas that have been neglected somewhat but Boston Scientific. So we haven't produced a bare metal stent for ten years and we have rarely refurbished the IVUS business, obviously new catheter, new software and then anticipate that we can integrate FFI next year on a very competitive wire. So we have focused a lot on the core IC business which previously perhaps just escaped our attention. Susan Lisa : With that, we\u2019d like to conclude the call. Thanks for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific. And before you disconnect, Linda, will give you all the pertinent details for the replay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 10 :30 AM Eastern time today until August 7 at midnight.

Welcome to the Boston Scientific Q3 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Susie Lisa. Please go ahead. Susie Lisa : Thank you, Roxanne. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q3 2014 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website, under the heading, Financial Information. The duration of this morning's call will be one hour. Mike will begin our prepared remarks with an update on our business progress and his perspectives on the quarter. Dan will then review our overall Q3 2014 financial results as well as guidance for full-year 2014 and the Q4 2014. During today's question-and-answer session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our chief medical officers, Dr. Keith Dawkins and Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share; new product approvals and launches; clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected use; our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q4 and full-year 2014 guidance; as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs and 8-Ks filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I will turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike? Mike Mahoney : Thank you, Susie. Good morning, everyone. Boston Scientific delivered excellent results in third quarter as the company continues to strengthen and build global momentum. Our results were driven by above market revenue growth across almost all of our seven divisions, with mid-to-upper single-digit growth in all three of our business groups. 8% in Cardiovascular, 7% in Rhythm Management and 5% in Medical Surgical. We expanded operating margins to 20.5%, representing 120-basis point improvement year-over-year and a 70-basis point improvement quarter-over-quarter and we delivered 20% year-over-year adjusted EPS growth. Our third quarter results reflect our sharp focus on delivering meaningful innovation to our patients and physicians, while also providing clinical and economic value to our customers. Third quarter results built on our first half momentum and through nine months, we have achieved 5% operational sales growth and 20% adjusted EPS growth, demonstrating strong execution of our strategic plan, continued momentum of our diversified product portfolio, improved position in our core markets and strong progress on our growth initiatives. We continue to believe the Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to drive sustainable double-digit EPS growth given our reinvigorated culture, a strong pipeline, global expansion and significant opportunities for margin improvement. I will now provide some brief highlights on third quarter and thoughts on our outlook. Dan will review the financials and fourth quarter 2014 guidance. Then we will take your questions. Please note that in my remarks all references to growth are on a year-over-year constant currency basis. In terms of highlights for the quarter, first we delivered balanced revenue growth. All three of our business groups and regions grew above market. Second, we delivered exceptional performance in Interventional Cardiology. Third, we continue to build up on track record of consistent revenue growth and expanding operating margins. Starting with our balanced revenue growth, our 6% reported gain in sales after normalizing for foreign exchange and acquisitions, represents 5% organic revenue growth. I will discuss the excellent growth delivery by our IC division shortly, but I would also like to note that Cardiac Rhythm Management group delivered strong 4% growth for the second quarter in a row, led by S-ICD, our new MINI ICD and our X4 quad pulse CRT-D system in Europe and pulse generator in the U.S. Patient and physician demand for our S-ICD, the only defibrillator that doesn't require leads in the heart has been very strong. We now have a full year goal of achieving $100 million in S-ICD revenue in 2014. The breadth of the S-ICD clinical data set continues to grow as IDE and EFFORTLESS show low complications rates with no lead failures and no systemic infections. We continue to make progress on payer coverage with - recently announcing broader coverage for S-ICD patients. We continue to gain share in de novo ICD implants and we believe that we now have the number two U.S. share position in de novo ICD implants non-CRT-D. We also believe that we are being rewarded for the clinical and economic value of our battery longevity. Two very recent new independent contemporary longevity studies were presented at last month's Heart Failure Society of America and have added to a growing body of evidence that demonstrates the superiority of BSC longevity. These de novo share gains were offsetting replacement headwinds that will likely persist for another 18 to 24 months, given our superior battery longevity. In CRT-D, we believe we have gained at least one point of the de novo shares since launching our X4 quad pulse generator in the U.S. this spring, but still face longevity replacement headwinds in this segment. Our MedSurg division continues its consistent performance, which is led by endoscopy, accelerating to 7% growth due to the depth and breadth of its product portfolio and strong global leadership position. Urology and Women's Health also grew above market as our strategy to invest in key international geographies fueled double-digit growth in all international regions for the fifth consecutive quarter. Key to this growth has been our new product registrations with more than 130 year-to-date globally and a strong focus on physician training. Once again, Europe delivered impressive results with the sales growth of 11%, which we view as a confirmation of our reinvigorated portfolio and strategic approach. Within Europe, IC, Urology, Women's Health and Neuromod, all grew double digits, but CRM and Endo sales were up mid-to-single digits. We will continue to diversify for our portfolio in key segments such as the recently closed acquisition of Interventional division of Bayer AG, while we expand geographically. Emerging markets grew 19% and now represent 10% of our total sales. Now, turning to IC, we delivered sales growth of IC of 8% in interventional cardiology, driven by continued strong performance of our Promus PREMIER DES, but we believe we have maintained U.S. market leadership and gained a meaningful share in Japan. Other drivers included our next-generation Synergy stent platform, our newly launched REBEL bare-metal stent, the unparalleled breadth of our complex PCI portfolio and strong growth off of a small base from our structural heart franchise, which now includes the LOTUS percutaneous valve and WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure. Looking forward, we are bullish on our rejuvenated IC pipeline, including SYNERGY, LOTUS and WATCHMAN to name a few, as well as our improved global sales execution. Our clinical programs are also progressing, so we recently enrolled our first patients in REPRISE III, a 1,000-patient clinical trial, designed to support U.S. regulatory approval of the LOTUS valve system. REPRISE III is a head-to-head randomized TAVR trial in the U.S. that is powered to show a possible benefit with LOTUS and the reduction of moderate or severe aortic regurgitation. At the American Heart Association Meeting, EVOLVE II, our pivotal trial designed to support SYNERGY U.S. approval will be a late-breaking clinical trial presentations in November 19th. We are also in active discussions with the FDA and WATCHMAN following a favorable vote at the October 8th advisory panel and we continue to target the first half '15 FDA approval. Finally, our continuing track record of consistent revenue growth and expanding operating margins now sets the sixth straight quarters of operational revenue growth. We are delivering on our financial commitments and we are well ahead of the total revenue growth and EPS commitments provided at our February 2013 Investor Day. For the first nine months of 2014, operational sales growth was 5%, and we have with expanded adjusted operating margin over 100 basis points from our full year 2013 rate. For the first half of '14, BSC grew adjusted EPS 19% year-over-year, which is well above our peer group suggested EPS growth. We remain committed to double-digit adjusted EPS growth and we believe this represents attractive scarcity value, given our revenue growth and margin expansion opportunities relative to peers'. We continue to manage our litigation risk and we are confident in our legal strategies. We believe we are appropriately reserved and have strong liquidity and a very manageable cadence of events should our legal strategies have unfavorable outcomes. In summary, strengthened execution, improved results in our core business are more than offsetting some of the promising, yet delayed adjacencies. Our European results are evidence of our promising pipeline and we continue to diversify our portfolio of key segments and expand geographically. We have delivered consistent revenue growth for six straight records while driving adjusted operating margin expansion. A key driver of our consistent track record is the cultural transformation we fostered over the past three years which was [found] in our core values. I would like to thank our employees for their winning spirit and the commitment to Boston Scientific, and also extend a warm welcome to our new members from Bayer Interventional. Now, let me turn the call over to Dan. Dan Brennan : Thanks Mike. I will start with some overall perspective on the quarter before diving into the details. We generated adjusted EPS of $0.20 compared to $0.17 in Q3 of 2013, representing 20% year-over-year growth and achieving the high-end of our guidance range of $0.18 to $0.20. The improved performance in Q3 was driven primarily by operational revenue growth and gross margin expansion. These improvements were partially offset by SG&A spending related to our acquisition Bayer Interventional, core product launches and variable employee-related benefits. We posted an adjusted operating margin of 20.5%, which represents improvement of 120 basis points over Q3 of last year. We believe we are on track to meet or exceed our profitability goal of roughly 100+ basis points of annual operating margin improvement, which would result in an adjusted operating margin of 20% for the full-year 2014. In addition, we generated adjusted free cash flow of $330 million and operating cash flow $346 million in the quarter. We continue to execute against our goal of consistent revenue growth and operating margin expansion and believe we are uniquely positioned to drive double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. Now, I will provide a detailed review of our Q3 business performance and operating results. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter of 2013 and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a constant currency basis. For the third quarter of 2014, consolidated revenue of $1,846 billion exceeded the high end of our guidance range and represented operational revenue growth of 7%, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the divested Neurovascular business. On an as reported basis, revenue grew 6% year-over-year, excluding an approximate 150-basis point contribution from the Bard EP and Bayer Interventional acquisitions, organic revenue growth was 5% in the quarter. The foreign exchange impact on sales was a $10 million headwinds compared to the prior year period, about $19 million worse than we had assumed in our guidance range. I will now provide more details on the revenue results for our seven divisions, which roll up into the three business groups. I will start with Medical Surgical, where total group sales of $588 million grew 5% and group adjusted operating income increased 120 basis points to 32.4%. Endoscopy sales grew 7% worldwide, with strong new product contribution driving growth in all franchises, most notably biliary, tissue acquisition and metal stents. All regions posted growth as well and Latin America was particularly strong growing 21% for the second quarter in a row. Urology and Women's Health worldwide sales continued to outperform the market and grew 5% with particular strength internationally and an impressive 57% emerging markets sales growth. To close out the MedSurg results, our worldwide Neuromodulation business was flat in the quarter, which we believe is better than the overall SCS market performance. As we previously discussed, changes to Medicare reimbursement for physician office trialing of spinal cord stimulation systems went into effect on January 1 and is negatively impacting market growth in 2014. We are facing particularly difficult comparisons in the second half of 2014, given the anniversary of our Precision Spectra launch, coupled with the acceleration of physician office trial into Q4 of last year in anticipation of the reimbursement change. Our goal remains to grow faster than this market given the strength of our technology and we are encouraged by early physician feedback on our newly launched CoverEdge 32 contact paddle. Turning now to the Cardiovascular Group, which consists of the Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions divisions, global sales for the group totaled $723 million and grew 8%. Cardiovascular Group adjusted operating margins for the quarter of 27.5%, represented a 150-basis point improvement year-over-year. Within cardiovascular, worldwide Interventional Cardiology sales of $508 million grew 8%. Globally, DES sales grew 10% with U.S. DES sales up 13% and OUS DES sales increasing 8%, led by an impressive 12% growth in Europe. We continued to execute our market segmentation strategy and increased our mix of synergy in select markets to 20% of total Europe DES sales. Despite the reimbursement cut headwind in Japan, Asia's DES results were up 6% and we believe we gained share sequentially in Japan. Worldwide complex PCI solutions or other IC grew 2% and includes all legacy Interventional Cardiology product lines outside DES, including bare-metal stents, core IC products which include guidewires, balloons and other accessories and imaging products such as Intravascular Ultrasound. The 2% growth in complex PCI solutions was led by Imaging with 6% growth and core IC with 3% growth. Overall, we are very pleased with our IC performance in the quarter and believe it validates our strategy to drive above market growth by providing interventional cardiologist with the broadest portfolio technology and differentiated products to treat the most complex coronary cases. In Structural Heart, our LOTUS percutaneous valve posted solid sequential growth on a constant currency basis of a small base and WATCHMAN continued its strong growth with revenue up 40%. Peripheral Interventions delivered worldwide revenue growth of 9%, which includes roughly one month of revenue from the acquired Bayer Interventional business. Excluding the contribution from Bayer Interventional, worldwide PI grew 5%. U.S. growth of 16% was led by strength in the interventional oncology franchise as well as the addition of the Bayer Interventional products and revenue synergies within the legacy BSC PI business. Excluding the contribution from Bayer Interventional U.S. PI grew 8%; partially offsetting this weakness was weakness in Asia where we saw some procedural softness particularly in Japan. Finally, I will discuss our Rhythm Management group, which consists of our Electrophysiology and Cardiac Rhythm Management divisions. Worldwide Rhythm Management sales in Q3 of $534 million grew 7%. Rhythm Management's adjusted operating margin for Q3 of 14.1% represents a 160-basis point improvement year-over-year, the third consecutive quarter, where Rhythm Management margins have improved at least 100 basis points over the prior year. Worldwide Electrophysiology revenue was up 57%, with legacy BSE EP sales roughly flat. We entered into limited market release for our Rhythmia mapping and navigation system with six sites now up and running in the U.S. and Europe and strong physician feedback given the systems' higher fidelity images acquired in a fraction of the time required by the competitors' systems. For the Cardiac Rhythm Management division, Q3 worldwide sales increased 4%. Growth in CRM was led by Europe, which grew 6%. On a worldwide basis, defib sales of $348 million grew 5%. U.S. defib revenue posted solid growth of 4%, driven by continued S-ICD momentum in the first full quarter of contribution from our MINI ICD and X4 quad pulse generator as we continue to gain de novo ICD share. Worldwide pacer sales were flat totaling $132 million. International growth was strong at 8%, led by adoption of our INGENIO family of pacemakers. We believe we continued to gain share in the OUS pacer market. I would like to reiterate that our belief is that CRM trends are best analyzed over multiple quarters. This is the second consecutive quarter of 4% worldwide CRM growth and CRM sales are up 2% on a rolling 12-month basis, which we estimate to be faster than the underlying combined pacemaker and defibrillator markets. We continue to believe, we will be a net share gainer in worldwide CRM in 2014. Turning now to the P&L, adjusted gross profit margin for the third quarter was 71.1%, up 40 basis points year-over-year and 80 basis points, sequentially. The increase was largely attributable to benefits from our value improvement programs, partially offset by price erosion. We continue to believe our full year adjusted gross margin will be in the range of 70% to 71%. Once again, the impact of foreign exchange upon gross margin was immaterial as a result of our hedging program. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $701 million or 38.0% of sales in Q3 of this year. Note that this excludes acquisition and divestiture related charges of $34 million that are included in our GAAP results. Our Q3 2014 adjusted SG&A rate represents an 80-basis point increase in SG&A spending as a percentage of revenue compared to Q3 of last year, due to higher spend to support product launches and one-time items related to variable employee related benefits and our acquisition of Bayer Interventional. We expect SG&A to decrease in Q4 of this year as a percent of sales, and we now believe, our full-year SG&A spend will be in the range of 37% to 38% of revenue.  Adjusted research and development expenses were $212 million in the third quarter or 11.5% of sales. As a percent of sales, this represents a 100-basis point decline in year-over-year spending, due to efficiency gains and the timing of projects. We now believe our full-year R&D spend will be in the range of 11% to 11.5% of revenue. Royalty expense was $21 million in the quarter or 1.1% of sales, down 50 basis points year-over-year due to a more favorable than expected royalty structure and we expect our royalty rate in Q4 of this year to be roughly flat to Q4 of last year. On an adjusted basis, pre-tax operating income was $379 million in the quarter or 20.5% of sales, up 120 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points, sequentially. Adjusted pre-tax operating income grew 13% with all three of our reportable segments contributing to the improvement. GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items of $315 million in the quarter, was $64 million. The GAAP to adjusted items for the quarter included litigation charges of $139 million, acquisition and divestiture related charges of $38 million, restructuring and other charges of $29 million and amortization expense of $109 million. Our total accrual for all legal matters was $945 million as of September 30, 2014. Now, I will move on to other income and expense, which primarily consisted of interest expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $54 million, which is $83 million lower than Q3 of last year and this is primarily due to the refinancing of our public debt in Q3 of 2013, which included a pre-tax one-time charge of approximately $70 million. Our tax rate for the third quarter was negative on a reported basis, due primarily to the litigation related charges that negatively impacted reported pre-tax income. Our effective tax rate was 14.4% on an adjusted basis and we expect our Q4 2014 adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 12% to 14% and our full-year 2014 adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 12% to 13%. Finally, Q3 2014 adjusted EPS of $0.20 per share, represents 20% year-over-year growth. Included in the adjusted EPS calculation is an approximately $7 million lower royalty expense, almost equally offset by a higher tax rate resulting from a different geographic mix of earnings. On a reported GAAP basis, Q3 2014 EPS was $0.03 and includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $230 million after-tax. The $0.03 of GAAP EPS in Q3 of this year compares to breakeven in the prior year period. Moving onto the balance sheet, DSO of 61 days decreased 5 days compared to September of 2013, due primarily to strong collections in Europe. Days inventory on hand of 165 days was up 4 days compared to September of last year and up 17 days compared to December of 2013, due to higher inventory in advance of launches and lower cost of goods sold, driven primarily by standard cost improvements and a favorable product mix. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $330 million compared to $291 million in Q3 of last year and we continue to expect our full-year 2014 adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $1.2 billion. Capital expenditures were $57 million in Q3 of this year compared to $56 million in Q3 of 2013. There were no sharing purchases in the quarter as we issued a net cash payment of $414 million to acquire the Interventional division of Bayer AG, we value returning cash to shareholders, share repurchase and M&A remain our top two capital allocation priorities. Any continuation of our share repurchase program in 2014 would be subject to business development opportunities, market conditions, our stock performance, regulatory trading windows and other factors. I would like to conclude with our guidance for Q4 and full year 2014. For the full-year 2014, we expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $7,370 billion to $7,420 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 5% operationally and 3% to 4% on a reported basis. We now expect foreign exchange to be a $55 million headwind for the full-year 2014 and we expect adjusted EPS for the full-year 2014 to be in the range of $0.81 to $0.83. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.22 to $0.24. Now turning to the fourth quarter, we expect consolidated revenues to be a range of $1,875 billion to 1,925 billion. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the headwinds from FX should be approximately $27 million or 150 basis points relative to Q4 last year. On operational basis, we expect consolidated Q4 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of 4% to 6%. For the fourth quarter, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.20 to $0.22 per share and reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.09 to $0.11 per share. I encourage you to check our investor relations website for Q3 2014 financial and operational highlights, which outline Q3 results and 2014 guidance. With that, I will turn it back to Suzie, who will the moderate the Q&A. Susie Lisa : Thanks, Dan. Roxanne, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes to 35 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourselves to one question and one related follow-up. Roxanne, please go ahead. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Bruce Nudell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse : Good morning. It is very clean impressive quarter. Just in terms of this [stent] number which is very impressive and well above the market, is it possible to continue that sort of momentum with the contribution of SYNERGY, perhaps offset by lapping of the German issue et cetera? Mike Mahoney : Thanks, Bruce. It's Mike. Good morning. We are certainly pleased with our total DES performance, [online] order quarter, but also for the year-to-date. Year-to-date, our performance DES as a percent in the quarter, it was 10%, big share gains in the U.S. Promus PREMIER and also Japan. Also, we continue to see strong growth in Europe, so really it's balanced across the globe. As we look forward to, not to provide guidance, but as we look forward at 2015, we continue to see positive momentum there in the portfolio, we anticipate large vessel product to be approved in Japan, we expect to expand the reimbursement for SYNERGY in Europe beyond the countries that we are currently selling it in and we continue to maintain a kind of disciplined tiered pricing strategy that offers innovation to physicians and patients. We also expect to further strengthen that business based on the adjacencies and hopefully WATCHMAN approval on the first half of 2015 and the ongoing progress of LOTUS, all of which provide a hail over to our poor Interventional Cardiology business. Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse : Just speaking of WATCHMAN, congratulations. Third time to [charm], it looks like in my view, approval is going to happen. It just seems that given the messiness around the panel et cetera, reimbursement may be more of an issue. How should we be thinking about that? Should we be thinking about national coverage determination, new technology add-on payment? How should we be thinking the pace of adoption, because it is clearly needed in certain populations? Mike Mahoney : Yes. We are very encouraged by the progress. I think, whenever you bring a unique - and you are the first one to do it, innovation to market it takes a while. We are pleased with the panel and hopeful for the approval. A lot of the questions you asked there, our views really haven't changed. We still believe this is a large un-served market, we are still confident in the $500 million market opportunity that we have talked about and we laid that out in our Investor Day. Even at that $500 million represents just 3% to 5% penetration of the [patients] with elevated stroke risk, who are eligible for warfarin, so we feel like we have been quite conservative candidly in terms of sizing the market. Also, we have appropriately built the WATCHMAN approval timeframes as we look at our as a guidance for fourth quarter and we will provide guidance in '15. I think, as you look at BSC beyond WATCHMAN, I think, I would stress the strong performance in our core businesses. Some of these adjacencies like WATCHMAN, which are unique and innovative have been a bit slower to market, but they are still in play and we look forward to their positive growth in the future. Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse : Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead. Rick Wise - Stifel: Good morning, everybody. Thanks to the excellent quarter. CRM, Mike, operating margins at 14.2% obviously are excellent. Can you give us a little more color? Is this a new sustainable operating margin level? Maybe talk in more detail about what drove that performance. Was it volume, was it cost-cutting and help us understand maybe looking ahead should we expect continued sequential expansion in CRM operating margins? Dan Brennan : Rick, this is Dan. I will take that one for you. I think that the key is, the last part of your question which is that is our goal, is the continued sequential improvement in that. For that group, operating margin expansion is their top strategic imperative and it informs all of their strategies. In terms of the Q3 specifics, 160-basis point improvement to 14.1%, the good news is, it's not one specific thing that did it. It is all up and down the P&L throughout cost of goods and SG&A and R&D and our goal is to continue to do that in a very thoughtful and measured fashion over time as part of our goal as the total company to getting to 25% by 2017. Rick Wise - Stifel: Just sort of follow-up on S-ICD, I mean, clearly you sort of raised your goal to $100 million target now. Can you talk about the rollout? Again, any more details on how many accounts you are seeing? Maybe talk at as well about reimbursement? We had some pushback from physicians who have been concerned about reimbursement. Mike, you highlighted, maybe talk about the Medicare and commercial reimbursement progress. What is needed to see another dramatic step forward in S-ICDs in '15 and beyond, frankly. Mike Mahoney : Thanks. We look at this as a long-term platform that's uniquely differentiated and we continue to build on, so we have not changed our market opportunity forecast, which we call the $750 million. We will continue to provide guidance on that in the future. I would say overall, we are encouraged by the uptick of S-ICD in the U.S. and Europe. The adoption of therapies being driven by growing clinical experience for the system and continued flow of positive data and we are really supporting that, Rick, with a lot of ongoing clinical work and we think that clinical work will build a strong unique platform for long time and we are supporting that with the [data set]. In the terms of the guidelines, the European Society of Cardiology is added to S-ICD in a recommendation for treating patients with cardiomyopathy. As you mentioned on the reimbursement side, we expect positive reimbursement changes the U.S. and we are encouraged by the recent coverage expansion of (Inaudible). We think all of those things, the ongoing building of evidence, the training that we are providing, the training that our sales reps receive, the experience that physicians have and backed by robust clinical data that we continue to build on will continue to extend the lead that we have in this category. Rick Wise - Stifel: Thanks. Operator : Our next question then comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Lewis - Morgan Stanley : Good morning. Mike, just one question for you and one question for Dan. You have been saying all year that the second half is going to accelerator. There obviously have been concerns about that, but certainly that is the quays. You basically said the global business is going to start looking a lot more like Europe as you get this is product pipeline you are being enhanced. I guess, I wonder if could you talk about this quarter as it relates to the relative inflection and then the sustainability of these results as you head into '15, would you consider SYNERGY, WATCHMAN, and obviously what you commented on as it relates to S-ICD, and then I had a quick follow-up. Mike Mahoney : Yes. We want to build a higher performance company. That the company that does it consistently and we measure ourselves by growing faster than the market, expanding operating income margins and driving double-digit EPS growth and building a winning culture in a global mindset that is unique, so that core culture is a big part of what we do and I think the international growth is a strong leading indicator. The company has had six quarters of consecutive growth and we were very comfortable with our outlook for fourth quarter to extend that to seven quarters. As you mentioned, our international performance in the third quarter was 9%. More specifically, our European results were 11% growth, where we have mostly all of these adjacencies that have been further matured in terms of the rollout. We won't give '15 guidance, but we have a lot of exciting opportunities in 2015. We will continue to expand our Interventional Cardiology platform like I mentioned it before. We will continue to broaden our CRM platform in terms of S-ICD utilization and clinical work. We are hopeful for the WATCHMAN approval, we continue to make strong progress with our LOTUS, which we just recently started our trial in U.S. and we are driving momentum there in Europe. Our MedSurg businesses, time-to-time we have some fluctuations in the quarter. Overall, if you look at a group of businesses, they continue to drive mid single-digit growth, excellent margin improvement and really continue to provide great balance of our portfolio. We are encouraged about the future, but we are certainly not satisfied. David Lewis - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Then Dan, just your GMs were very strong in the quarter. You obviously reiterated that you are on pace for 100 basis points of op market margin expansion this year, but the one thing we see consistent this year is you are still investing a fair amount in SG&A and I wonder as the pipeline expands and you head into '15 and that growth rate is 5%, perhaps even higher than 5%. Talk to us about that SG&A investments that's necessary in '15 and '16. Does it stay at the levels that we are seeing here in '14 or do you begin to get some leverage on that SG&A investments as you cycle into next two years? Thank you. Dan Brennan : Thanks, David. I think, as opposed to giving specific guidance within the P&L, I think we can be clear that the SG&A rate will go down as part of us achieving our overall operating income margin targets. As we have said in the past, there are certain times we need to make investment and be opportunistic and obviously there is pieces of that that have driven the growth that we have been able to put on the board. Overall, if you think of us getting to 25%, you should see SG&A be a lower percentage of sales on the way to 25%. David Lewis - Morgan Stanley : Great. Thanks, Dan. Operator : We have a question from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan: Thank you. First off congratulation on a really nice quarter. Mike, I want to get your thoughts on the quarter sector landscape with the consolidation we have seen this year and wanted to get your thoughts on how that impacts Boston Scientific and how you see your role playing out it. Mike Mahoney : Yes. Great question. Thank you. We are very comfortable with the business units that we plan today. We are playing three big sectors interventional cardiology, Rhythm Management and our MedSurg. We continue to provide acquisitions and tuck-in acquisitions that strengthen our unique profile in those businesses. We planned a lot of R&D to strengthen those, so we are very comfortable with the business that we sell in today. Also, we believe that, when you cut across these different business units, it is very rare in the hospital system that a hospital will contract for our Neuromodulation products and our cardiology products and our, say, our EP products, so that happens very rarely. For customers who want to do that, we certainly can enable that, but we don't see that type of bundling across multiple sectors occur very frequently, so we don't think that portfolio in terms of bundling really is an added value, so we don't see much benefit in that. The benefit that we see in delivering unique innovation to physicians in certain categories, and I think our six quarters of growth and the performance we have in the third quarter would point to that strategy is working and I would also point to the unique margin improvement opportunity that we have. I think our portfolio is positioned well. We have a lot of opportunities to improve it, but we don't see some of the consolidation that is taking place. Maybe other than the cost benefits and some cost synergies, we don't see a growth benefit with bundling across as multiple sectors that are very despaired from each other. Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan: Let me ask - the performance that we are seeing here it's really been driven as you outlined by the business that you are taking sharing and obviously in drug-eluting stents and ICD and defibrillator business is going well, but these are challenging core markets underneath that. Do you feel the need to add more pipeline? Obviously, this is a very good quarter, but you are betting on markets that are growing and I know you preferred better market that are growing, so given the kind of questions on a layer WATCHMAN and similar pipeline stuff. Do you want to add more pipelines to portfolio today? Mike Mahoney : I think we always looking for new capabilities. We just acquired the Bayer technology, but just take a step back, I think in med device most of the markets are fairly challenging, so it's a very competitive business. We feel comfortable and we strive to outperform our peers and to growth faster than market and you are seeing that. In terms of our thirst for innovation, we clearly want to drive down the SG&A that Dan commented on and we are committed to doing that. At the same time, we are very aggressive in looking at portfolio alternatives that will continue to strengthen our business units. Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan: Okay. Thank you, Mike. Operator : Our next question is from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : Thanks very much. Can you hear me okay? Mike Mahoney : Yes. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : Great. Good morning, so two quick things. First on SYNERGY in Europe, can you give us a sense as to market share right now for your stent franchise overall in Europe, relative to the last couple quarters? What I am particularly curious about is are you gaining share while holding the price premium or have you come off the price premium that I think you initially launched with? Mike Mahoney : Good question, so we are very selective. Our strategy hasn't changed we are very selective in the countries that we sell SYNERGY in and we are also very selective in terms of the price point, because we think to establish a long-term market that is strong and healthy, that type of discipline is needed, so we haven't come off that strategy, so we are very careful about it. We talked about potential reimbursement improvements, potentially in France next year, which may make SYNERGY more attractive in that country, so we are disciplined about what countries we could move to and we do have a pricing premium for SYNERGY, so I would not articulate the sheer gains as a result of dropping price in SYNERGY. It's something we could do, but it is not something that we feel a long-term the best for BSC or for the market. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : In terms of the market share specifically, where you are in Europe today and where you think you've been? Mike Mahoney : Yes. We haven't broken out the specific share of SYNERGY of our overall marketplace. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : Okay. Then just one question on litigation, Mike, just can you give us any update on timing on when you think we will hear something from the J&J bench trial? If there is anything you can say generally it would be helpful to folks on this topic, I am sure people would be interested if there's anything to say, but just mostly looking for a timing update. Dan Brennan : Sure. Bob, this is Dan. I think as many folks might know, it's a bench trial. It starts November 25th, November 20th, runs through the 25th. If there is more time needed, there's some time set aside the [week] of 15th to wrap it up. We feel confident in our position heading into that. I feel like it's a high bar that needs to be proven in that and it's intended to bench trial post the completion of the trial then the judge will issue his decision at some point post the trial. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets : Hi. Good morning. Two questions, first, for you, Mike. In the U.S., a very strong ICD quarter, you raised your guidance on the S-ICD, so that was a contributor. You also called out the quad can in that performance. In the fourth quarter here, Medtronic will be in the market with their quad can and quad pole, so I wondering if you can discuss how we see the market dynamics playing out for Boston Scientific in the fourth quarter and going forward with Medtronic on the market with both, a quad X and quad [pole]? Thanks. Mike Mahoney : When we look at CRM, we are really pleased with our performance globally, particularly in Europe. Again, we have more of our most recent portfolio. In terms of market overall, we think the market has stabilized a bit, so it is probably flat to maybe down slightly in 2014. As Dan mentioned, when you look at the kind of 12-month rolling average, we are up 2%, so we are growing faster than the underlying market. We are still having quite a bit of portfolio to bring to the U.S. In terms of just our performance, I think when you look at our position in it, we will continue to accelerate S-ICD development. I think that we will continue to get more clinical traction and more comfort level with physicians, so we are positive about that. We will also going into 2015, have our full year of our MINI platform as well as our quad generator, so in CRT-D, kind of pointing your question there, we feel like we have gained share in de novo implants. We continue to lose a little bit of share on replacement headwinds. I think despite Medtronic coming to market there, I think, physicians really value the battery longevity capabilities that we offer in our products, so we are very comfortable with the momentum that the CRM business has as we look forward to 2015. Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. Dan, can you give us an update on the Mesh litigation, how much is reserved and did you add to any of those reserves in the third quarter? Thanks. Dan Brennan : Sure, Glenn. As you know, we don't disclose specific components of our reserve. We obviously review our reserve every quarter and believe it reflects what's probable and [estimateable] at that time. Our accrual for all legal matters of which Mesh is a portion is $945 million as of the end of September, but as you can appreciate I am not going to break that out specifically by individual litigation matter. Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets : Can you tell us if that $945 million at the end of September, was that an increase from 2Q or 1Q? Dan Brennan : It was an increase. Yes. We had $139 million increase in litigation from Q2 to Q3, $139 million charge. Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : Good job on the quarter. Dan, I couldn't help, but ask a tax question, because I know you love how I ask tax questions. Can you just kind of walk us through. I know you gave some helpful comments at Morgan Stanley in September just on the tax outlook. Maybe just kind of go over the tax position again and comment on to what extent you guys have an exposure or utilize the double-IRS situation? Then also I have a second follow-up after that. Dan Brennan : Sure. I will start with the double-IRS, so we don't anticipate that the double-IRS would have any impact on our structure. Then relative to overall broader tax commentary, in our prepared remarks, I had mentioned that we think Q4 tax rate will be between 12% and 14%. Overall this year 12% to 13%, sticking next year with 13% to 15%, overall, again, all that assumes that the R&D tax credit is not reenacted that's worth up to 200 basis points on our overall rate. Then beyond 2015, as we look to balance all of the elements of our structure, you would see movements in that 100-basis point range increase from 16 outward. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : 100 basis points each year going out. Dan Brennan : Correct. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : Then can you review with us too just the IRS litigation and dispute that you have with the total amount that they are asserting that you owe them and just kind of the context of, I guess, the broader liability picture with the 945. What kind of the total cash potential outflows could be over the next three years or so? Dan Brennan : Sure. Just in summary on the guiding transfer pricing matter what the IRS has asserted for the period that's in the question now is $1,162 billion, which is in our SEC filings plus interest. What we have in total for all of our tax controversies is $1.5 billion of which [guide] TPV as a portion that and we obviously don't disclose the specifics of that reserve. From a timing perspective, it has moved more slowly than we would have anticipated and the next event will be scheduling a trial date which could be in '16 or later. With ultimate resolution in '17 or beyond, so it has moved at a pretty slow pace overall relative to the expected timing. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brooks West with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Brooks West - Piper Jaffray : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Question for Keith on LOTUS, just trying to get any anecdotal feedback on the clinical performance with the expanded offering, I know you had data at London Valves. Just any update on the program in Europe would be helpful. Then I have got one follow-up. Keith Dawkins : Sure, Brooks. As you know at London Valves, we presented the 250 patients out of REPRISE II extension, which confirms excellent key performance and importantly and adjudicated moderate power valve leak rate is 0.6%, which I think is best-in-class of 30 days and no severe leak. We are continuing the investigation of LOTUS in Europe with the Respond trial which a 1,000-patient post market study. That's on track in terms of recruitment. Also, in that trial, unlike a REPRISE II extension is the addition of the third valve size 25 millimeter valves, so there is 23 millimeter, 25 millimeter and 27 millimeter and that we knew from the REPRISE II CE Mark trial that there are a number of patients that fell within that 25 millimeter range, who didn't get the valve because we didn't have a 27 millimeter and that that negatively affect the pacemaker rate, so it's too early to say yet whether the pacemaker rate is full and with the additional 25 millimeter valve. We will know that from the RESPONSE study. Also, we had had three strong live cases at PCT and another three strong live cases at London Valves, and one of those three at London Valves was a direct aortic implant in terms of hospital with an excellent result. That's [access]. We are continuing to pursue with the LOTUS valve. Then just finally, of course, our pivotal REPRISE III trial has already started in this country, which is a head-to-head comparison with core valve, just over 1,000 patients. That, plus our pipeline, which is in development makes us very comforted about our offerings. Brooks West - Piper Jaffray : Thanks for that. Maybe just a quick follow-up there, when would we see the registry data in Europe and get a read on the pacemaker rate. Then just on the Bayer acquisition, maybe not as much of a focus for investors, but that is a piece of business that really has not been invested in for the last couple years. Just wondering, now that you have got a month or so under your belt there, if you could give a little more clarity on the opportunity set and kind of how we could see the peripheral business grow at Boston Scientific looking forward? Mike Mahoney : I will just answer the first part of that question. We will have an early count of the RESPOND data before 1,000 patients are recruited. We have not made public the time point of that as yet. Brooks West - Piper Jaffray : Thank you. Dan Brennan : Yes. Just a quick comment on our peripheral business, year-to-date, through third quarter it is up about that 6%. Then there is 9% in the quarter with Bayer and probably about 5% or so ex-Bayer. Overall, our views on it Brooks, haven't changed. We have a nice addition there, where we have an excellent sales force. It's already calling on those customers and there are two segments that we didn't plan and they are clear leader in thrombectomy, so that's a nice addition for us and also in the atherectomy market, you have a market that is growing and it is a market that will put additional investment in terms of the portfolio in both, in the cardiovascular side and also the peripheral side. It is a nice addition for us. It leverages our current sales force and capabilities as well as operations and we continue to invest in that peripheral vascular market and that should be a nice piece for us. Brooks West - Piper Jaffray : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo : Thanks for taking the question. I had one housekeeping question and two real questions. Dan, on the 4% to 6% organic growth guidance for Q4 is that with or without acquisitions? Dan Brennan : That's with. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo : Is that adjusted for acquisitions or not? In other words, if you adjust for acquisitions, would it be more like 2% to 4% or not? Dan Brennan : That's correct. Yes. The Bayer and Bard are a little north of 150 basis points, so you back that off of the 4% to 6%. Yes. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo : Underlying, you are calling for basically about 2% to 4%. Is that correct? Is there any reason why you would expect it to decelerate a little bit from Q3? Dan Brennan : Yes. 2.5% to 4.5% is probably the way we would characterize it. There is a couple things that would drive that, some that are Q3 this year-related and some that are Q4 last year-related. On Q4 last year simple one, we grew 5% last year in Q4, so that was our strongest quarter to-date, so it's a little bit tougher comp overall. Specifically in that comp, is a really tough neuromod comp of 33% growth that they had last year in the fourth quarter. Then when you think of Q3, we had some businesses that significantly outperformed their underlying market growth rates. If you think IC, endo and CRM at 8, 7 and 4, so a more normalized growth rate they and that puts you into the range that we have put out for the fourth quarter. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo : Okay. That's helpful. I wanted to ask one on SYNERGY and one on the J&J litigation. For Keith, prior bioabsorbable polymer drug-eluting stent trials have not shown a clinical difference from durable polymer DES, at one year, how important do you think the clinical difference is at one year for the market acceptance of SYNERGY in the U.S.? Then on J&J, Mike, I appreciate your comments earlier. Dan, maybe if you could - it's been obviously an overhang for the stock, if you could kind of lay out what you think the key issues are, the facts on your side of the argument, and your ability to manage an unfavorable outcome should that happen. Thanks. Dan Brennan : Thanks, Larry. I think it's important to understand that all bioabsorbable polymer stents are not similar, so the data for some of the competitor products available in Europe have really related to a thick stent with a thick layer of polymer that laid to resolve. As you know, we will be interested to see the results of the EVOLVE II pivotal trial which, which is a late break around the 19th of November at AHA, and this will be the first bioabsorbable polymer pivotal trial in the U.S. and we are anticipating FDA approval is in July 2015. I think, the fact that the polymer and the drug synchronously disappears at about three months time point makes SYNERGY interesting. Obviously, we will give us the opportunity to firm exploring short dual antiplatelet therapy. Couple that with your key performance, which is I think well-recognized, we are very competent. This is a product and we will be excited to bring it to the U.S. Incidentally, as a note, that we will be holding an investor event in Chicago after the presentation on November 19th. The event will be at 1 pm. Central Time and we can obviously discuss the details of the trial at that time. Dan Brennan : Then Larry, on the J&J case, this Dan. Two parts to your question, I don't think it would serve us well to get into all of specifics of why we feel like confident relative to our position there. As you can certainly appreciate, the last piece in terms of our ability to deal with any unfavorable outcome, we are confident that we can deal with that. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo : Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Josh Jennings - Cowen & Company: Hi. Thanks for getting me involved. I appreciate it. I just wanted to first start with maybe some commentary if you would on the health of the U.S. and international ICD markets from a pricing and volume perspective and your outlook for these markets going forward. Just on the subcutaneous ICD, increasing your guidance it is nice to see, but maybe you could talk about where you are having the most success on the implant side? Is it cannibalizing or gaining share in the single market segment or is the subcutaneous ICD actually expanding the market and you are having success implants in patients that were previously contraindicated for an [vascular] device? Mike Mahoney : Yes. Just some comments in the market, just to reinforce what I mentioned a little bit earlier, there are still a challenging market, but we think it's improved slightly, so we are calling the overall CRM market kind of flattish to slightly down negative. There may be kind of zero to negative-2 in terms of the full-year when you roll together both, CRM, including pacemaker and defibrillators. As we indicated before, we are going a little bit faster than market, quite a bit faster in Europe, where we have all of our new products and slightly faster than market died in the U.S. Overall, we are pleased with our performance. On S-ICD, I am probably not going to give can give you all the information wanted there. I think as we talked about, we are being very thoughtful with the rollout of S-ICD in terms of our training, the clinical build that we have with it. We have given guidance earlier in the year of $75 million. We are taking that up to comfortable of delivering against 100. We will likely provide additional insights in terms of our clinical strategy and growth prospects as we point towards our January '15.call. In terms of the marketplace itself, we do think on occasion, it clearly expands the market in some ways. Some patients typically could have an ICD, but there would be young patients, patients with the venous access issues, so in some cases it will expand their market. Overall, I think if you look at BSE in our portfolio, you have a market that's we think more stable than it has in the past and we the unique innovative platform that's multi-years ahead of the competition that we are committed to building clinical evidence from. Having a product is helpful and strengthens our full Rhythm Management business when you take into account our EP business and more traditional ICDs. Ken Stein, I am not sure if you have any additional comments you would like to make. Dr. Stein? Ken Stein : Yes. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Josh. I just want to reiterate what is Mike saying, it's very hard to break down how many of these patients are going to be S-ICD or patients who would otherwise have gotten it transvenous system and certainly we are very happy with our transvenous system as well. I think if you look at who are the really strong candidates, one of the obvious candidates for the S-ICD today, these are the patient who don't have vascular access or patient who have had recurrent or prior infected transvenous systems, patients with renal failure. Even though I don't think we have any way to breakdown how many of those would not have gotten that transvenous ICD, certainly there's large number of them who are just completely new to the market. Josh Jennings - Cowen & Company: If I could ask one follow-up for Dr Stein? Mike, I heard your comments about you are still comfortable with the $500 million market opportunity for the WATCHMAN, I think there has been some consternation after the panel with a lot of panel members, recommending a label of it being \"Second-line therapy.\" I am just wondering if I could some prospects from Dr Stein about, what has changed in terms of that guidance by the panel as a second-line therapy and does that impact the overall market opportunity? Thanks a lot Ken Stein : Yes. I will take that. Thanks, Josh. I am just glad. I think what you recognize is you what's important on the panel and beyond the vote, so the commentary and the explanations of the panel members made for the vote. We really are very pleased with the overall outcome of the panel. I think if you looked at what the comments are and what they said is that they really wanted us just to be more clear in our labeling about who are the appropriate patients for and if you look at we said, I think we are in full agreement with them. We have never ever thought that this device will have to be a broad replacement for oral anticoagulant therapy. This is a device for patients who are eligible to take warfarin but who for one reason or another have valid clinical reasons to prefer long-term alternative. What we can't get into details of any our discussions with FDA at this point, from our standpoint really what the panel was asking us to do was to clarify what we have always said we believe to be the appropriate patient population. Susie Lisa : Okay. Great. With that, we would like to conclude the call. Thanks for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific. Before you disconnect, Roxanne will give you all the pertinent details for the replay. Thanks very much.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. And I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Susie Lisa. Please go ahead. Susie Lisa : Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q4 2014 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our Web site under the heading, Financial Information. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will begin our prepared remarks with an update on our business progress and his perspectives on the quarter and year. Dan will then review our overall Q4 2014 and full-year 2014 financial results as well as guidance for full-year 2015 and Q1 2015. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Keith Dawkins and Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share; new product approvals and launches; clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected use; our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q4 and full-year 2014 results and 2015 guidance; as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses.

These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike? Mike Mahoney : Thank you, Susie, and good morning, everyone. Boston Scientific delivered excellent well balanced results in Q4 as the Company continues to strengthen execution, diversify our portfolio on regional mix and build global momentum. in the quarter is the result of broad : Importantly, our Q4 results built upon the momentum generated over the past few years and contributed to the following full-year \u201914 results. Number one, we delivered above market revenue growth with 6% operational growth and 4% organic, excluding the acquired sales from Bard EP and Bayer Peripheral. We expanded adjusted operating margins 130 basis points over 2013 to 20.2%. And number three; we grew adjusted EPS to $0.84, which represents 15% growth for the full-year despite currency headwinds in the fourth quarter. We are continuing our track record of consistent results and exceeding the goals we provide at our February 13 Investor Day conference. We really continue to believe that Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to deliver at or above market revenue growth and consistent double-digit EPS growth via our ongoing operating margin improvement initiatives. Our results demonstrate that we\u2019re a Company that continues to deliver on those commitments. Since joining Boston Scientific three years ago, I\u2019ve met with many customers globally and its really clear that we\u2019re becoming a strong partner of choice, given our focus on meaningful innovation to improve patient outcomes and reduce overall healthcare cost. Our strategy is to provide market leading, comprehensive and innovative products and solutions to targeted clinical service lines. We strive to address several of the pressures facing healthcare systems today, the need to improve outcomes, lower costs, and increase access to life-saving and life enhancing therapies. Our fourth quarter and full-year 2014 results reflect this focus on delivering meaningful innovation to our patients and physicians, while also providing clinical and economic value to our hospitals and healthcare systems. I'll now provide some highlights in Q4 and 2014 results, along with thoughts on 2015 outlook and beyond. Dan will then review the financials and 2015 guidance and we will take your questions after that. Please note that these remarks all references to growth on a year-over-year constant currency basis unless otherwise specified. Many of our key highlights for the quarter are consistent with our achievements throughout the first three quarters of 2014. Number one, we delivered balanced 7% revenue growth in the fourth quarter with Cardiovascular growth of 10%, 5% growth in Rhythm Management and 4% in MedSurg. We are very encouraged by the strong results across most of our businesses and I\u2019d particularly like to point out that growth rates in Interventional Cardiology at 10% and Urology and Women's Health at 9%. Also encouraged by the consistency of results in our Cardiac Rhythm Management business posting 3% revenue growth in the quarter, which brings sales growth in CRM for the trailing 12 months to 2%. Additionally, we saw strong results across all regions, led once again by impressive revenue growth of 10% in Europe, which we view as confirmation of our reinvigorated portfolio and strategic approach. Emerging markets revenue continued to grow at high teens rate, plus 17% in Q4 and represented 10% of total sales for the fourth quarter and full-year 2014. Taking a closer look at Interventional Cardiology, operational revenue growth of 10% in the quarter was due to the continued strong performance of our innovative portfolio and execution of our global commercial teams. We continue to gain share in a number of cardiovascular segments and DES, our differentiated platform of premier and synergy continues to build momentum globally and gain worldwide share. We are excited about expanding the global reach of SYNERGY and PREMIER in 2015. Other growth drivers include our complex PCI portfolio, such as Polaris and solutions for a complex total occlusions. We also enjoy continued strong growth of a small base from our Structural Heart franchise, which includes the highly differentiated second-generation LOTUS percutaneous valve and our WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure device. For LOTUS, we are currently enrolling patients in the REPRISE III clinical study for FDA approval and Respond which is a 1,000 patient post-market registry in Europe. And we continue to expect a first half 2015 FDA approval for our WATCHMAN device. Looking forward, we are bullish on a rejuvenated IC pipeline and emerging Structural Heart business, including the SYNERGY, LOTUS, WATCHMAN, BRIDGEPOINT and the Polaris integrated IVUS and FFR imaging systems. We believe that Boston Scientific brings a uniquely broad set of solutions to help interventional cardiologist, heart teams and hospitals treat the most complex coronary artery in Structural Heart disease patients. Moving to MedSurg, Urology and Women's Health performance of 9% revenue growth in the fourth quarter brought the full-year growth rate to 7% led by our global expansion efforts. Urology and Women's Health is a great example of our global mindset and diversification, as the business have now posted OUS double-digit operational revenue growth for six consecutive quarters. Our Endoscopy team continues its high performance track record with consistent mid single-digit sales growth as revenue increased 5% operation in the quarter with growth in every region led by Latin America and Asia. Another highlight is our consistent revenue growth in Cardiac Rhythm Management with 3% revenue growth in the quarter and 2% for the full-year. We continue to grow de novo ICD share in the U.S despite the replacement share headwinds created by the excellent performance of our industry leading battery longevity. Our momentum in growth was once again fuelled by our strong portfolio, including a continued adoption of S-ICD, MINI, which is the world's smallest ICD, the longevity associated with our EnduraLife battery technology and our X4 quadripolar CRT-D system in Europe and pulse generator in the U.S. Patient and physician demand for our S-ICD, which is the only defibrillator that doesn't touch the heart or invade the vasculature, continues to be strong. We comfortably exceeded our 2014 full-year goal of delivering $100 million. We also continue to expand S-ICD reimbursement coverage with improved Medicare outpatient rates and physician payment codes in 2015 and new commercial coverage such as the recently announced TRICARE, following on from the Aeta approval from last quarter. TRICARE for example, with 10 million members provides coverage to active duty and retired military for medical services outside of the VA system, where S-ICD is also reimbursed. We strengthened our number two U.S share position in the de novo ICD implants and we expect continued momentum in 2015 given the growing clinical evidence and improved U.S reimbursement outlook for S-ICD. The targeted year-end 2015 launch of our second generation system EMBLEM, continued new product cadence as core CRM around the world and really increased recognition of the clinical and economic benefits of our EnduraLife battery technology. Our confidence is also bolstered by our 2014 performance of our European team, the region where each competitor has the latest products and solutions and Boston Scientific continues to take de novo share. An example of how we\u2019re helping the healthcare systems reduce costs is our latest break through in CRM longevity. This unique capability in battery longevity was recently highlighted by Dr. Samir Saba, at the University of Pittsburg Medical Center. Dr. Saba led the first U.S implant of DYNAGEN EL and as data was recently published in the peer-reviewed journal called EuroPace, which demonstrates a superior longevity of Boston Scientific CRT-Ds versus competitors. The DYNAGEN EL platform offers our proprietary EnduraLife battery. This technology enables a smaller size, up to 11% smaller, 24% thinner than the competitors with industries longest projected battery longevity at approximately 12 years. Our battery technology allows us to help patients and hospitals reduce the cost and potential complications associated with early replacement. Turning now to revenue growth and expanding operating margins. I'm pleased to report that we are continuing our strong track record. We achieved seven straight quarters of operational revenue growth, we\u2019re delivering on our financial goals and we\u2019re ahead of the total revenue growth and EPS goals provide on our February 13 Investor Day. For the full-year \u201914, sales growth of 6% and we expanded operating margins of 130 basis points from our full-year \u201913 rate. We also meet our guidance and grew our adjusted EPS 15% year-over-year. We remain committed to our goal for double-digit adjusted EPS growth. And we believe this represents attractive scarcity value, given our revenue growth and differentiated margin expansion opportunities relative to our peers. As we close the books on 2014, I\u2019d like to provide an update on the progress of a few of our key adjacency growth platforms. We continue to build capabilities and momentum in the Structural Heart. I discussed the ongoing clinical program for our LOTUS TAVR valve which posted strong growth and reorder rates in fourth quarter and remains on track for our 2017 U.S approval. In addition, WATCHMAN remains on track for first half 2015 FDA approval. In our Peripheral Interventions business, the acquisition of the Interventional Division of Bayer AG with the Thrombectomy and Atherectomy platforms has been an important step to strengthen our global key [ph] acquisition and expand our capabilities. Moving to renal denervation, we believe in our long-term value of the Vessix platform, we recently received FDA approval for an innovative IDE study called Reduce HTN Reinforce, which is designed to isolate the effects of our Vessix renal denervation system, while minimizing the impact of multiple medications and patient compliance that occurred in other trials. We expect to begin enrolling in this study in first half 2015. Rhythmia, our mapping and navigation system for use by electrophysiologist to map and treat complex heart arrhythmias is in limited market release and was recently featured in several successful live cases at the January AFib meeting, in Orlando. Momentum is also improving for our Alair, our BT system for Bronchial Thermoplasty, for treating for patients with severe asthma. Alair has recently received positive commercial coverage from both CareFirst with 3 million members and HCFC, the nations fourth largest insurer with over 40 million members. And finally VERCISE, our Deep Brain Stimulation system for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and another tremor disorders is building momentum in Europe in its second year of commercial availability. Enrollment continues in our U.S pivotal trial for DBS therapy in Parkinson's disease patients. So in summary, strength and execution, and improved results in our core business are really driving consistent results across the Company. Our European growth continues to provide evidence of our promising pipeline and we\u2019re expanding our capabilities globally, particularly in emerging markets. It\u2019s really an exciting time for Boston Scientific, and we look forward to continued high-performance globally. And to us that means above market revenue growth, leveraged operating income of growth via margin expansion, which in turn will drive differentiated double-digit EPS growth and we\u2019re executing towards these goals. So in closing, we\u2019re pleased with our \u201914. It was a significant year of advancement in our operations, our pipeline and our commercial performance. Our global employees are inspired by our mission and transforming patient lives with innovative medical solutions and we estimate that Boston Scientific products touch more than 21 million patients in 2014. I\u2019d like to thank our employees for their winning spirit and their tremendous commitment to the Company. I'll now turn the call over to Dan, for a more detailed review of our financials. Dan Brennan : Thanks, Mike. I will start with some overall perspective on the quarter before diving into the details. We generated adjusted EPS of $0.22 achieving the high-end of our guidance range of $0.20 to $0.22. The strong performance in Q4 was driven primarily by operational revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and a lower than expected tax rate. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacted Q4 adjusted EPS by one penny. Our Q4 2014 adjusted operating margin of 20.7%, represents improvement of 210 basis points over Q4 of 2013. We\u2019re pleased that we also exceeded our profitability goal for the full-year of 2014 delivering an adjusted operating margin of 20.2%, representing 130 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement over the full-year of 2013. In addition, we generated adjusted free cash flow of $508 million and operating cash flow of $439 million in the quarter. The strong cash flow generation this quarter helped us exceed our adjusted free cash flow goal of $1.2 billion for the full-year of 2014. Now I'll provide a detailed review of our Q4 business performance and operating results. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2013 and all revenue growth rates are given on a year-over-year constant currency basis. For the fourth quarter of 2014, consolidated revenue of $1.887 billion represented operational revenue growth of 7%, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the divested Neurovascular business. On an as reported basis, revenue grew 3% year-over-year. Excluding foreign currency impact, divestments and an approximate 200 basis point contribution from the Bard EP and the Bayer Interventional acquisitions, organic revenue growth was 5% in the quarter. The foreign exchange impact on sales was a $71 million headwind or approximately 385 basis points compared to the prior year period and about $44 million worse than we assumed in our guidance range. I\u2019ll provide more color on FX later in my commentary.  I\u2019ll now provide more details on the revenue results for our seven businesses, which roll up into our three reporting segments. I\u2019ll start with MedSurg, where total group sales of $614 million grew 4% and group adjusted operating income increased 170 basis points to 33.2%. Endoscopy sales grew 5% worldwide, driven by 7% growth in biliary, the largest franchise and all regions posted growth with Latin America being particularly strong growing above 20% for the third consecutive quarter. Urology and Women's Health worldwide sales continued to outperform the market and grew an impressive 9%, driven by double-digit growth in the urology franchise and international sales stood out again with Europe and Asia each growing 20%. To close out the MedSurg results, our worldwide Neuromodulation business declined 2% in the quarter, reflecting a very difficult comparison to Q4 of 2013 were growth was 30% plus and slower U.S market growth due to reimbursement changes that impacted physician office trialing. For the full-year 2014, our Neuromodulation global revenue grew 5% and we believe we gained share in the U.S spinal cord stimulator market. Turning now to the Cardiovascular Group, which consists of the Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions businesses, global sales for the group totaled $745 million and grew 10%. Cardiovascular Group adjusted operating margins for the quarter of 25.9%, represented a 470 basis point improvement year-over-year. Within cardiovascular, worldwide Interventional Cardiology sales of $523 million grew 10%. Globally, DES grew 12% with exceptional balance as the U.S., Europe, and Asia, all grew DES revenue double-digits. Worldwide complex PCI solutions grew 3% led by imaging, which grew double-digits driven by strong performances in the U.S., and Japan. This growth is due to physician demand for our OptiCross IVUS catheter and ongoing launch of our Polaris hardware system which can integrate both IVUS and FFR in the same platform. It was the second consecutive quarter of significantly above market revenue growth in IC, and we believe it validates our strategy of providing the interventional cardiologist with the broadest portfolio of technology and differentiated products to treat the most complex coronary cases. In Structural Heart, our LOTUS percutaneous valve continues to build momentum and WATCHMAN is now approved in over 70 countries and grew over 30% for the full-year. Peripheral Interventions delivered worldwide revenue growth of 10%, driven primarily by revenue from the acquired Bayer Interventional business. Offsetting this was some weakness in the core balloon business where we saw some softness during the quarter due to some recent global launches. We expect this newly strengthened peripheral franchise to grow above market in 2015 as we fully integrate the commercial teams and technology platforms. Finally, I will discuss our Rhythm Management group, which consists of our Electrophysiology and Cardiac Rhythm Management businesses. Worldwide Rhythm Management sales in Q4 of $527 million grew 5%. Rhythm Management's Q4 adjusted operating margin of 14.8% represents a roughly 800 basis point improvement year-over-year, admittedly off a low base in Q4 of 2013. Rhythm Management demonstrated consistent adjusted operating margin improvements throughout the year with mid teens or higher operating income growth every quarter, resulting in a Rhythm Management full-year 2014 adjusted operating margin of 13.4%. This represents improvement of 310 basis points over the full-year 2013. We are very pleased with this progress and remain focused on our goal of returning Rhythm Management\u2019s adjusted operating margins to the low 20s in 2017. As we previously mentioned, there may be trade-offs that cause the rate of improvement to fluctuate from one quarter to the next and we encourage you to gauge improvements on a full-year basis. And given the gross margin significance of key new product launches, such as INGENIO 2 or ACCOLADE, and EMBLEM S-ICD, we expect gains in 2015 Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to be a bit back-end loaded towards the second half of the year. Worldwide Electrophysiology revenue was up 23% in Q4, with legacy BSE EP sales up low single-digit. We continued the progress of our limited market release for our Rhythmia mapping and navigation system and we\u2019re pleased by the early feedback from physicians using the system, given its higher fidelity images acquired in a fraction of the time required by competitive systems. For the Cardiac Rhythm Management division, Q4 worldwide sales increased 3%. Growth in CRM was led by Europe, which grew 6% for the second consecutive quarter. On a worldwide basis, defib sales of $339 million grew 5%. U.S. defib revenue posted solid growth of 5%, driven by continued S-ICD and MINI ICD momentum and our X4 quad pulse generator as we continue to gain de novo ICD share. Worldwide pacer sales were flat totaling $129 million. International growth was strong at 6%, led by adoption of our INGENIO family of pacemakers. Again, as we\u2019ve said, CRM trends are best analyzed over multiple quarters, we believe we were net share gainers in worldwide CRM for the full-year 2014, as we estimate our 2% sales growth outpaced the underlying combined pacemaker and defibrillator market. Let me now briefly recap full-year 2014 revenue. On a reported basis, consolidated revenue was $7.380 billion, which represents a 3% increase from the prior year. On an operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the divested neurovascular business, sales increased 6% compared to 2013. Organically, which excludes foreign currency impact, divestments, and contribution from the acquired BARD EP and Bayer PI businesses, revenue grew 4% over full-year 2013. Lastly, foreign currency negatively impacted reported sales growth by approximately 120 basis points or about $86 million. Turning now to the P&L, adjusted gross profit margin for the fourth quarter was 71.4%, up 140 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points, sequentially. The increase was largely attributable to benefits from our standard cost reduction program, partially offset by price erosion. For the full-year 2014, our adjusted gross profit margin was 70.7% compared to 69.7% for the full-year 2013. The 100 basis point net full-year gross margin improvement stemmed from improvements in standard costs, and lower sales of divested businesses partially offset by price as well as volume and mix. For Q4 and the full-year 2014, as a result of our hedging program, FX positively impacted gross margin by 40 and 20 basis points respectively.  Adjusted SG&A expenses were $724 million or 38.4% of sales in Q4, roughly flat to the rate in Q4 of 2013. Our Q4 adjusted SG&A rate includes roughly 85 basis point impact related to settlement of a long standing litigation matter and fees related to our IRS transfer pricing litigation, the timing of which has continued to move out. For the full-year 2014, adjusted SG&A expenses were $2.8 billion or 37.9% of sales. We are not satisfied with this level of spending and are expecting our full-year adjusted SG&A rate to decrease by roughly 100 basis points in 2015. Adjusted research and development expenses were $208 million in the fourth quarter or 11% of sales. As a percent of sales, this represents a 70 basis point decline in year-over-year spending, due to efficiency gains and the timing of projects. For the full-year 2014, adjusted R&D expenses were $817 million or 11.1% of sales. Royalty expense was $25 million in the quarter or 1.3% of sales, in line with Q4 of 2013 and for the full-year 2014 royalty expense was $111 million or 1.5% of sales. On an adjusted basis, pre-tax operating income was $390 million in the quarter or 20.7% of sales, up 210 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points, sequentially. Adjusted pre-tax operating income grew 14% with all three of our reportable segments contributing to the improvement. GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items of $283 million, was $107 million in Q4. The primary GAAP to adjusted items for the quarter included litigation related charges of $37 million, contingent consideration expense of $37 million, intangible asset impairment of $18 million, restructuring and other charges of $48 million and amortization expense of $111 million. Our total accrual for all legal matters was $972 million as of December 31, 2014, an increase of $27 million due to cost related to ongoing litigation. Now, I\u2019ll move to our other income and expense, which primarily consisted of interest expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $54 million, which is $4 million lower than Q4 of 2013. Full-year 2014 interest expense was $216 million; $109 million lower than full-year 2013, primarily due to the refinancing of our public debt in Q3 of 2013. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was negative on a reported basis, and 7.7% on an adjusted basis. Our Q4 2014 adjusted tax rate includes roughly $16 million of discrete tax benefits. Now I\u2019ll provide a bit more detail on our full-year 2014 adjusted tax rate where our most recent guidance was 12% to 13%. As you may know, the tax extenders package was passed during the fourth quarter of 2014, which included a one-year extension of the U.S R&D tax credit for 2014. The R&D tax credit itself was roughly 150 favorable basis points. However, other elements of the legislation had an unfavorable impact of about 50 basis points for a net favorable impact of approximately 100 basis points. In addition, we had certain Q4 discrete tax items that reduced our full-year rate by approximately 100 basis points. The net result of this is our 10.9% adjusted tax rate for the full-year. Therefore, without the tax extenders package and the Q4 tax discrete, our full-year 2014 adjusted tax rate would have been in the 13% range. The difference between our reported and adjusted tax rates for the quarter is attributable to charges excluded in determining our non-GAAP results. For the full-year, we reported adjusted EPS of $0.84 per share which represents 15% adjusted EPS growth over 2013. On a reported GAAP basis, 2014 EPS was $0.20 per share. GAAP results for 2014 included after-tax charges of $862 million or $0.64 per share related to intangible asset impairments, acquisition and divestiture related costs, litigation, restructuring related expenses, and amortization of intangible assets. Moving on to the balance sheet, DSO of 56 days decreased 9 days compared to December of 2013, due primarily to strong collections in Europe. Days inventory on hand of 156 days was up 7 days compared to December 2013, due to higher inventory in advance of launches and lower cost of goods sold, driven primarily by standard cost improvements and a favorable product mix. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $508 million compared to $319 million in Q4 2013. Our full-year 2014 adjusted free cash flow of $1.261 billion represents growth of 6% over full-year 2013. This increase was primarily due to higher adjusted operating profit and continued focus on reducing working capital partially offset by higher ordinary tax payments due to the use of acquired tax benefits in 2013. Capital expenditures were $79 million in the fourth quarter compared to $85 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. For the full-year, capital expenditures were $259 million compared to $245 million in 2013. There were no share repurchases in the quarter and there is no change to our top capital allocation priorities, M&A and share repurchase while maintaining flexibility. Any continuation of our share repurchase program in 2015 would be subject to business development opportunities, market conditions, our stock performance, regulatory trading windows, and other factors. To summarize, 2014 was a strong year for Boston Scientific as we continue to make solid progress on our global strategy. We delivered against three critical financial objectives, consistent revenue growth, meaningful adjusted operating margin expansion, and double-digit adjusted EPS growth, specifically 6% operational revenue growth, 10% adjusted operating income growth, and 15% adjusted EPS growth. Although pleased with 2014 results, we believe that we will continue to have opportunities to enhance profitability and expect to continue to generate strong cash flow. I\u2019d like to conclude with guidance for Q1 and full-year 2015. For the full-year 2015, we expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $7.300 billion to $7.500 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 3% to 6% on an operational basis and a decline of 1% to growth of 2% on a reported basis. As a result of a stronger dollar at current rates, we expect foreign currency to be roughly $310 million headwind for the full-year 2015. We expect our adjusted gross margin for the year as a percentage of sales to be in the range of 71% to 72%. Although we expect to continue to see downward pricing pressure, we expect this headwind to be offset by improved price management, principally through market segmentation and tiered offerings and standard cost reduction programs. We believe that the impact of these benefits will increase particular in the second half of 2015. Our adjusted SG&A rate was 37.9% in 2014 and our goal was to bring the full-year 2015 adjusted SG&A rate to between 36.5% and 37.5% of sales. We continue to transform our R&D organization and refocus our spending to drive innovation and growth. In 2015, we expect adjusted R&D expenses as a percent of sales to be in the range of 11% to 12%. We expect 2015 royalties to be approximately 1% of sales, 50 basis points less than 2014. Interest and other expense is expected to be slightly higher in 2015 than 2014, primarily due to some net investment gains we recognized in 2014, we do not expect these gains to reoccur. This implies a full-year adjusted operating margin in the range of 21.5% to 22.5%, the mid point of which represents 180 basis points of improvement over full-year 2014. We expect our adjusted tax rate for the full-year 2015 to be between 13% and 15% consistent with what we\u2019ve said throughout 2014. As you'd expect, this does not assume an extension of the U.S R&D tax credit or any other expired tax provisions during 2015, nor does it assume any discrete tax items. It does assume a more normalized geographic mix of earnings. As a result, we expect adjusted EPS for the full-year 2015 to be in the range of $0.88 to $0.92. We believe we have an effective hedging program with a three-year time horizon that has a long track record of successfully minimizing the foreign exchange impact on operating income, with current euro and yen rates we haven't seen in close to a decade, we expect 2015 adjusted EPS to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.04 or a little north of $50 million of adjusted income -- net income. The $0.04 impact breaks down into roughly $0.01 per quarter for modeling purposes and our full-year adjusted EPS guidance range reflects this. Despite this $0.04 hit, our goal remains double-digit adjusted EPS growth, which will be realized at the higher end of our range. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.42 to $0.48 and lastly for 2015 our guidance assumes adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion, capital expenditures of approximately $260 million, pre-tax amortization expense of approximately $435 million, stock comp expense of approximately $100 million and a share count of roughly $1.345 billion fully diluted weighted average shares for our EPS calculations for the full-year subject to the conditions I mentioned earlier. Now turning to Q1, 2015, we expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $1.740 billion to $1.800 billion. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the headwind from FX should be approximately $90 million or 500 basis points relative to Q1 of 2014. On an operational basis, we expect consolidated Q1 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of 3% to 6%. For the first quarter, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.19 to $0.21 per share and GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.07 to $0.11 per share. I encourage you to check our investor relations Web site for Q4 2014 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q4 results, as well as Q1 and full-year 2015 guidance including P&L line item guidance. So with that, I'll turn it back to Suzie, who will moderate the Q&A. Susie Lisa : Thanks, Dan. Brad, let's open it up to questions for the next 25 minutes. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Brad, please go ahead. Operator : Of course. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Lewis : Good morning. Mike, just two questions here. Maybe one for you, one for Dan. So just taking \u201915 guidance for a second here, a little stronger at the top end of the range than we\u2019d have expected, but maybe help us understand what drives the top and the bottom end of this view and specifically what assumptions have you made for key pipeline products in \u201915 and namely they are S-ICD, WATCHMAN and SYNERGY? And just had a quick follow-up. Mike Mahoney : Sure, David. I'll take that one and then I'll hand your call off as well. As you look at the 3% to 6%, we\u2019re not going to get into the specifics of what the individual line item guidance is for specific products within that, but at the low end of that, its markets that may not be as strong as they are today. Maybe pricing is a little bit more unfavorable. Always have to be wary of the global economy and then specific around Structural Heart maybe it's a slower ramp in some of our Structural Heart products, LOTUS and then WATCHMAN in the U.S. The flip side of that on the higher end of that is, maybe the core end markets are a little bit better. Some of them -- some of our markets we call kind of flat to slightly up. If those are a little bit better, then that\u2019s closer to the top end. The flip of the slower ramp in Structural Heart is maybe there is a stronger uptick relative to those products. And then, MedSurg which doesn't get a lot of attention on the high-end maybe better and earlier new product launches on MedSurg front could get us closer to the higher range as well. Hopefully that -- directionally hopeful that\u2019s helpful in terms of what would put us at each end of that range. David Lewis : Okay, very helpful. And then, maybe a related question on margins and growth. By our math, you\u2019ve got 10% to 15% constant currency earnings growth which is, obviously nothing to sneeze at for the year. But one of the big drivers has obviously been gross margin. This is the fourth straight quarter of GM expansion, the third straight year of GM expansion, and you\u2019re guiding to another robust GM year for \u201915. So, can you just give us specifically, what are those drivers of GM on the upside here for \u201915, and your confidence in this 500 basis points of operating margin expansion over the next two to three years. Thank you. Dan Brennan : Sure, David. You\u2019re correct. I mean, gross margin has been a significant point of strength for the company over the last two to three years. And we look for that to continue going forward. It\u2019s probably about a -- at the mid-point of our range, 80 basis points over 2014. So, we were 70.7 in 2014, and the mid-point of our range is 71.5. So, within that, it\u2019s a continuation of the same things that we\u2019ve been doing and executing on over the last couple of years, which is taking high single-digits of cost out of the system every year relative to standard cost. It obviously offsets the pricing impact that we have. And then we have other efforts in OCOGs around period expenses and excess and obsolete charges to really accelerate the gross margin improvement. So, it\u2019s been a big part of our story, and I would look for it to continue to be a big part of our margin expansion story going forward. David Lewis : Thank you very much. Dan Brennan : Thanks, David. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a couple of items on the guidance. Dan, I think you commented that you had a goal of producing SG&A by a 100 basis points in 2015. Could you just talk a bit about that, and what drives that and how you get there? Dan Brennan : Sure, Mike. Thanks for the question. So, clearly as we look at \u201914 -- 2014, the $379 million is higher than we wanted to it be, so we\u2019re redoubling our efforts on SG&A in \u201915. I\u2019d probably look at three key reasons and three key drivers that we\u2019re looking at for \u201915. You\u2019ll have better leverage in the adjacencies as sales continue to ramp at a lower operating cost. You think of LOTUS, you think of a U.S. rollout of WATCHMAN. So, overall structural heart just gets better in terms of a leverage perspective. We are doing some things around challenging our global team to really focus on reducing spending with a variety of new initiatives and programs. I\u2019d say undergoing a cultural shift to focus more directly on spending, everything from travel to meetings to suppliers to royalties. No stone left unturned there and then a continuation of what we\u2019ve done in the past which is, the G&A competitive benchmarking and making sure that all of our G&A functions have competitive benchmarks and time horizons to get to best in class against those benchmarks. There is a few others you think of leverage in the emerging markets, particularly in BRIC, reduced integration cost from prior acquisitions. So, there are other things, but I think those other three are really the key drivers that are going to get us down to that 37% in \u201915. Michael Weinstein : Okay. Let me ask couple of pipeline items before I drop. So one, have you submitted the G&A supplement for EMBLEM? Two, could you talk about the timing of INGENIO 2.0 in Europe which has started to rollout and then in U.S. and then third, can you give us any sense of when you expect to complete enrollment in REPRISE III for those? Thanks. Mike Mahoney : Hi, good morning, Mike. Yes, on the EMBLEM we\u2019re still confident that we\u2019ll be able to have a full rollout of EMBLEM product by the end of the year in 2015 both in U.S. and Europe, and we\u2019re really building up our internal supply chain capabilities to accommodate that goal for yearend launch in EMBLEM in both those markets. On the enrollment of our LOTUS TAVR valve we\u2019re making good progress there. We have about 50 to 60 patients enrolled currently, and we\u2019re confident of a fourth -- by yearend enrollment in 2015 for TAVR as well as our registry in Europe will continue to mount. And then third one, on WATCHMAN, I don\u2019t think you asked about that one. We\u2019re still confident in a first half approval in the U.S. with WATCHMAN. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead. Frederick Wise : Good morning, everybody. Can you talk a little bit about LOTUS in a little more detail? Clearly you\u2019re building momentum; you talked about the EU re-order rates. Is the availability in Europe [indiscernible] valve size making a difference? Is that what's helping? Is that the critical factor? And maybe talk about when we might see some data that reflects this broader size at? Thanks. Mike Mahoney : Sure. And Keith maybe you could make some comments upfront, I\u2019m done. The addition of the 25 millimeter valve has helped. We see that as the valve size that\u2019s used most frequently in Europe. And so having that valve size added to our matrix is very helpful, and then we should have -- add two additional sizes to our LOTUS fleet if you will by the end of the year. So that will help round out up to five sizes in our matrix in Europe. So we\u2019ll be positioned to have that by the end of the year. And in terms of the reorder rates, they continue to grow nicely off of a small base, and we\u2019ll likely highlight our structural heart business in particular at our upcoming investor day in the second quarter. So, we\u2019ll provide more details on some of the reorder rates and financials behind our TAVR program then. And in terms of the clinical piece, Keith did you have any comments on that? Keith Dawkins : Yes, Rick. So we are encouraged by the recruitment rates in the respond post market study in Europe which is a 1000 patient study and has the three valve sizes, 23, 25, 27, and at least a third of the patients, so the newest size was 25. And the first 250 of those patients will be presented at PCR in Paris in May. We also have a next-generation delivery system which is being tested and has performed very well, and the data from that will be presented at PCR as well. And as Mike says, REPRISE III is on track. The pivotal trial should complete by the end of the year. That of course had three valve sizes. And then the 21 and the 29 millimeter valve and a new sheath they\u2019re in development. And finally, we\u2019re very encouraged by the sale of the Safari wire, which is a dedicated TAVR wire which is being used not only for LOTUS implants, but also for competitive bowl implant. Frederick Wise : Thanks. And just, second question, maybe if you could talk Dan or more about the operating margin made. I mean, with zero margins continuing to expand despite exceeding your S-ICD goal. Maybe just a little more color, is the S-ICD more profitable than we thought? Are you getting it, cost reduction or a mix improvement elsewhere? And did you give a target S-ICD number for 2015, maybe I missed it. Thanks so much. Dan Brennan : Sure, Rick. No you didn\u2019t miss it. We didn\u2019t give specific number for S-ICD. We did in \u201914 obviously with a lot of interest around the ramp and the uptake and now in \u201915 and beyond we look at that really as part of our core business. Relative to your question on margins, I think I\u2019d start with the growth of \u201914 versus \u201913 in each of our segment. So, Rhythm Management gets a lot of focus. But if you look at operating margin for each of three segments, the cardiovascular was up 220 basis points year-over-year, Rhythm Management was up 310, and MedSurg was up 120. So, yes Rhythm Management is a big piece of that, but all segments are contributing. Specific to Rhythm Management we knew what the profitability was of the S-ICD heading into 2014 obviously and we have other programs and other actions and initiatives in place to ensure that we hit our target. So nothing really surprised us relative to that. We knew what we had heading into \u201914. We know what we have now heading into \u201915 until we launch EMBLEM by the end of the year in the U.S. and Europe. So, its all part of the overall well documented and executed plan within Rhythm Management to continue to drive margins back to the low-20s. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Bruce Nudell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Bruce Nudell : Good morning. Can you hear me okay? Dan Brennan : Yes, Bruce. Mike Mahoney : Good morning, Bruce. Bruce Nudell : Okay, great. Excellent year, Mike. Well done. The surprise I saw today was really about renal denervation. Could somebody talk about that trial design, when we might have results, and what are the key elements of it that will help tease out the specific treatment effect in what class of patients? Mike Mahoney : Dr. Dawkins, would you like to take that one? Keith Dawkins : Sure, Bruce. I mean, we can't release full details of the protocol right now, but we\u2019re having a great protocol with the agency. And we think, there were lots confounders as you know in the simplicity trial. And we feel we should pullout some of the obvious one in relation to patient compliance, manipulation of medication, the length of the primary endpoint and stability of the patient, as well as highlighting the performance of what we think is differentiated products. We remain very confident about renal denervation with Vessix not only for hypertension, but we have trials ongoing, investigator sponsored trials with other applications. And so, we think this will be a very important scientific study not just for Boston Scientific investors but actually for the field to justify the role of renal denervation in the treatment of difficult hypertension. Bruce Nudell : And my second question is, when I met with you guys recently, you expressed under-appreciation of your likely success in TAVI. Could you just kind of speak to the position that you hope to be able to retain and what's proving to be a much more robust market than people thought a year ago? And are there dimensions of performance improvement that would -- that could be improved upon in the current LOTUS design? Keith Dawkins : Do you want to talk to that Mike or? Mike Mahoney : Just briefly, then you can add to it, Keith. We take a lot of pride in the capabilities of our engineering teams and our clinical teams and our commercial teams. And we have very strong track record of delivering innovation across the cardiovascular business, and we have really excellent capabilities in terms of R&D and manufacturing at Galway. And we\u2019re really building strong knowledge base in structural heart in TAVR as well as WATCHMAN. So, we think given our leadership commercial position and the capabilities of R&D team that the structural heart expectations of the external analysts is quite understated as you go out in the mid and longer term of the strat plan. So we would be very disappointed in delivering against some of the projections that externally have been discussed. So we have a lot of confidence in the program, and we think with the differentiated platform, we\u2019re starting to see that and the revenue growth numbers in the fourth quarter in Europe. And we\u2019re really starting to click in terms of the productivity the R&D teams with, as Keith said with new valve sizes coming, reduction in profile of the device coming, and its really just building up new capabilities everyday. We also think the market as you said continues to expand globally, and we also think this is a very expensive endeavor to be fully committed to the TAVR space. And we don\u2019t think this market is going to be quite as crowded as what we see in Europe globally. Keith Dawkins : I would just add Bruce that, we\u2019ve got to a very good position in a very short time with the REPRISE program, and I would encourage you to look at the independent Weber [ph] data that we released shortly in Europe to identify the Boston Scientific LOTUS position in Europe. We\u2019d obviously give more granularity about the structural heart side at our New York Investor Day later this year. And finally of course the REPRISE III trial in the U.S, the pivotal trial is in fact incorporating two partner trials in one. So, we\u2019re looking at extreme risk and severe risk, and so, we\u2019ll catch up again. So we think considering we were later into the market we\u2019re in good shape. Bruce Nudell : Thanks so much. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Robert Hopkins : Thanks so much, and congrats on a good year. The first question, given that it\u2019s a point of interest for everybody, I was wondering if we could just get a quick litigation update from you in terms of any updated thoughts on the timing from a ruling from the judge in the J&J case, or just any other litigation milestones we should be aware of in 2015 as it relates to mesh or IRS? Dan Brennan : Sure, Bob, this is Dan. I\u2019ll take that one. Relative to the J&J litigation, I think it\u2019s where we were at the end of the closing comments in the end of January. With the judge we like our set of facts, and then are looking forward to a favorable resolution in that -- in his words shortly we\u2019ll see what that means relative to timing. With respect to mesh, we continue to try cases in mesh. So, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything necessarily to look for there. All the reserves that we have relative to all of our litigation are included in the $972 million that I referenced in my prepared remarks. Robert Hopkins : And then as a follow-up, I wanted to ask Dan a question on margins. I think you mentioned that Rhythm Management margins in 2015 would be a bit more backend loaded. So I was wondering if you could just explain that, should we expect continued sequential improvement earlier in the year, and to what degree are your pricing trends impacting things, and did pricing trends in the fourth quarter get worse or stay the same relative to earlier in the year? Thank you. Dan Brennan : Sure, Bob. No, it\u2019s not necessarily pricing trends, because they have been consistent through \u201914, and I don\u2019t think we see those changing in \u201915. I think as you look at \u201915, we\u2019re talking more about the backend for sequential improvements relative to Rhythm Management. I think in the first half, you\u2019d see it be more flat to where we have been. And then the benefits of EMBLEM and the INGENIO 2, ACCOLADE will really start to kick-in in the second half. So, again I just want to make sure that folks look at broader windows than just 90 day windows. And we feel very good at where we are as we exit \u201914, and we would look for, as we exit \u201915 to be in the same spot, but I\u2019d just look more to the back half of \u201915 for more incremental gains in Rhythm Management operating margins. Robert Hopkins : Great. Thanks for the color. Dan Brennan : Sure. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Danielle Antalffy : Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I was hoping you could give a little bit more color on endoscopy. You guys came in a little bit lower than we were expecting. And just wondering how we think about the Alaris adoption ramp here given the reimbursement pressures in such, and thinking about that in not just \u201915 but also longer term? Mike Mahoney : Sure. Thanks for asking the question on endoscopy. Overall we\u2019re pleased with the performance for the full year. We grew 5% in the quarter -- fourth quarter, 5% in the full year. We think that\u2019s slightly faster than the market. And the team is really building out \u2013 it\u2019s our most global business, and the team is building a number of new capabilities to drive future revenue growth particularly in Biliary in the emerging markets where there is a lot of under-penetrated patient demand as well as the need for greater physician training. So, our team is really pioneering that in the emerging markets. So, we think 5% of solid year. Then also as Dan, mentioned the MedSurg segment improved operating margins. And as you look to 2015, we\u2019ll have a stronger cadence of product launches in the endoscopy business in 2015 which should help. And also as you mentioned Alair which I think some had written off is starting to build some momentum in terms of reimbursement as I mentioned in the opening comments. So we still have a long way to go for Alair to make a meaningful impact on the top line of endoscopy, but we\u2019re not giving up on it, because the product works, the clinical results are very good. And we think over time, we\u2019ll continue to layer on additional reimbursement approvals where Alair maybe not in \u201915 but in the strat plan period will have a more significant impact on endoscopy\u2019s top line. Danielle Antalffy : Okay, great. That\u2019s really helpful. And then, on the Neuromodulation side of things, I know this was a tough year. You do have potentially more competition coming here in the back half of the year. So I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color about the trajectory there, and also an update on the clinical side of things. I know you guys are doing to accelerate clinical trial and when we could see some data from that? Thanks so much. Mike Mahoney : Sure. So, on Neuromod, the performance if you look across 2014 was a 5% grower, and we clearly had very high growth in the first half of the year off of our Spectra launch, and then we really had some very challenging growth comparables in the second -- really the second half of the year. I don\u2019t have the exact number, but growth comparable is probably in the 25% plus range that we\u2019re fighting against. So for the full year to scratch out of 5% growth we think its kind of in line with the market for Neuromodulation. We also are encouraged with as we head into 2015 with some new product approvals with the 32 contact paddle which we think provides additional differentiation with our Spectra platform, and Spectra continues to be really the market share leader in spinal cord stimulation with share gains there. So we have some new products that will come in 2015, and Nevro we anticipated their FDA approval, so that wasn\u2019t a surprise for us. We have been competing with Nevro for a number of years over in Europe and Australia. In Australia we\u2019re very comfortable with our leading market share position. And also as you mentioned, we are investing beyond the technology platforms in additional clinical studies for Neuromodulation, and we\u2019ll continue to report those out as appropriate. Danielle Antalffy : All right. Thanks so much. Susie Lisa : Brad, we\u2019ll take one more question please. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Brooks West with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Brooks West : Hi, guys. Thanks for sneaking me in. Couple of product questions, I was wondering on the synergy U.S. launch versus how you\u2019re launching that in Europe. You\u2019ve got tiered strategy over there, is that how we should think about the approach to the U.S. or can that be a workhorse stent and just any thoughts on kind of uptake there. Then I\u2019ve got a follow-up. Mike Mahoney : Yes, we haven\u2019t provided any insights yet in terms of the, kind of the launch strategy in the U.S. We are expecting FDA approval synergy in late \u201915, so hopefully we can get a potentially a fourth quarter impact with synergy. And we\u2019re continuing to be very careful about how we price that synergy. We think that\u2019s the best way to preserve the strength of this overall marketplace, the strategy to working for us, and for the full year we grew DES 6% in a combination between PREMIER and Synergy. So, we think we offer a differentiated platform that provides unique value and therefore we should be apprised appropriately that way. So, we\u2019ll continue to refine our launch plans for U.S. and communicate more details on that once it\u2019s approved. Brooks West : Thanks. And then on the EP platform with Rhythmia, can you give us a little bit more detail again on the launch trajectory there. And then I\u2019m curious in the accounts that have the Rhythmia system, are you seeing pull-through of your diagnostic catheters, and then when could we see the new ablation catheters I believe they\u2019re called the MiFi catheters, is that still on track for kind of the next 18 months here? Mike Mahoney : Yes. So, on the Rhythmia side we did see -- you saw a few cases if you went to the few live cases at the AFib meeting in Orlando early in January there. So we\u2019ve just really launched our first call it 10 sites or so globally, and we\u2019re seeing some excellent feedback in terms of the speed and acquisition times and the collection points of the Rhythmia platform. In those sites we are seeing some core pull-through as you mentioned in the diagnostic side. And also, lecture physiologists are looking at Boston Scientific as their Rhythm Management provider. So we also see the strength of our CRM business, the capabilities we have there will also help in the overall story with lecture physiologists. So we\u2019re in our early days of the Rhythmia launch but its going well on the sites that have installed it and we have seen some pull-through in diagnostic catheters. Brooks West : And anything Mike on the MiFi catheters? Mike Mahoney : Yes, on the MiFi catheters we\u2019re still enrolling in the U.S. and we\u2019re looking to continue to sell the open-irrigated platform for MiFi in Europe. Brooks West : Great. Thank you. End of Q&A Susie Lisa : And with that we\u2019d like to conclude the call. Thanks for joining us today. We sincerely appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific. And before you disconnect Brad will give you all the pertinent details for the replay. Thanks very much.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Lisa. Please go ahead. Susie Lisa : Thank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q1 2015 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our Web site under the heading, Financial Information. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately 45 minutes, slightly shorter than usual due to our upcoming Investor Day this Friday, May 1. Mike will begin our prepared remarks with an update on our business progress and his perspectives on the quarter. Dan will then review our overall Q1 2015 financial results as well as guidance for full year 2015 and Q2 2015. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Keith Dawkins and Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share; new product approvals and launches; clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected use; our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q2 and full year 2015 guidance; as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs and 8-Ks filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike? Mike Mahoney : Thank you, Susie. Good morning, everyone. Boston Scientific started off 2015 with solid results in the first quarter, as the company continued to deliver and build global momentum. We delivered 6% operating revenue growth and 18% year-over-year adjusted EPS growth, excluding a $0.02 negative impact for foreign exchange. We believe that we\u2019re poised to continue the strong execution and in first quarter we announced several new important product approvals and M&A transactions. These improved acquisition at the AMS urology portfolio and the endoscopic ultrasound capabilities of Xlumena, and our recently announced China joint venture with Frankenman Corporation. We\u2019re also pleased with the recent FDA approvals of our WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure platform and the next-generation EMBLEM S-ICD platform. All of these things reinforce our belief that Boston Scientific is well positioned to deliver at or above market revenue growth, and despite the increased currency headwinds, we maintain our goal of consistent double-digit adjusted EPS growth through our ongoing operating margin improvement initiatives. I\u2019ll provide some brief highlights of our first quarter but I\u2019ll save the comments on our longer term outlook for the Investor Day this Friday. Dan will review the financials and second quarter guidance and then we\u2019ll take your questions. So please note that in my remarks, all references to growth on a year-over-year basis in constant currency unless otherwise specified. In terms of the key highlights for the quarter, we delivered 6% operational revenue growth, strong operating margin expansion of 250 basis points versus first quarter 2014 and delivered adjusted EPS growth, excluding currency of 18%. Lastly, we strengthened and diversified our portfolio through new product approvals and M&A. Our results were driven by strong operational revenue growth at all three of our reporting segments; Cardiovascular up 10%, Rhythm Management up 4% and MedSurg up 4%. In addition, we saw balanced operational revenue growth from all of our primary regions led by Asia at 7%, in the U.S. and Europe at 6% growth. China continues to be our emerging market standout with revenue growth of 25% in the quarter. So once again, we\u2019re also encouraged by the strong results across most of our businesses but I\u2019d particularly like to point out another strong quarter in the Interventional Cardiology, which grew at 8% after going 9% in the second quarter of 2014. Growth in Interventional Cardiology was balanced across all franchises and regions with 7% global DES growth led by strength in Asia. DES growth also was solid in Europe where the SYNERGY Stent now represents more than 25% of our European DES sales. Our PCI guidance business also continues to deliver strong results, particularly in Japan where the OptiCross IVUS catheter and ongoing launch of our integrated Polaris imaging system. Finally, our IC performance was supported by our emerging Structural Heart business including our LOTUS percutaneous aortic valve and WATCHMAN LAAC platforms. So beyond IC, we\u2019re also pleased with our broad based growth of our MedSurg businesses and particularly encouraged by the ongoing strength of our Neuromodulation division. Neuromodulation grew 6% in the quarter, which was a 23% 2014 quarterly growth comp. And since 2011, the Neuromod division has risen from number three to number one market share in the U.S. spinal cord stimulation market. Turning to Rhythm Management, our EP business grew 6% and our CRM business grew 4% in the quarter and likely ahead of the market growth rate. Our CRM performance albeit against the favorable first quarter comp represents another quarter of above market revenue growth on the strength of our portfolio and global commercial execution. Note for the balance of 2015, we expect to see CRM perform more in line with the overall market growth rate given tougher quarter-over-quarter comparables and replacement cycle headwinds. So turning now to profitability, we expanded adjusted operating margins to 22.5 in the quarter, a 250 basis point improvement year-over-year and 180 basis point improvement sequentially. This drove 18% year-over-year adjusted EPS growth if you exclude the $0.02 negative impact of foreign exchange. Importantly, we remain committed to expanding our operating margins and we are making consistent progress and marching towards our target of 25% adjusted operating margin in 2017, which will represent a 620 basis point improvement from 2012 actual. In terms of EPS, despite the significant currency headwinds, we remain committed to our target for double-digit EPS growth and we\u2019re delivering on our financial goals with eight straight quarters of operational and revenue growth, and we\u2019re ahead of the revenue growth and adjusted EPS targets provided at our February 13 Investor Day. We look forward to updating those targets with you on Friday. So moving on some other highlights, our first quarter results reflect our sharp focus on delivering meaningful innovation to our patients and physicians while also providing clinical and economic value to our customers. A great example of this from our PI business is the exciting Eluvia drug-eluting stent data that was released just this morning at the Charing Cross Symposium in London. Eluvia is a drug-eluting stent that\u2019s purpose-built for the superficial femoral artery or SFA. We\u2019re extremely excited about our breakthrough trial results. The adjusted trial enrolled 57 patients at 15 European centers and met its primary endpoint with an impressive 94.4 patency rate at nine months. In addition to 94.4 patency rate, Eluvia also demonstrated a low target lesion revascularization rate at 3.6% and an excellent safety profile with a 3.6% major adverse event rate with no deaths and no amputations. We expect Eluvia will begin its global IDE in the second half of the year. We expect to receive CE Mark in the first half of 2016. We\u2019re also pleased with the early days of our distribution agreement with C. R. Bard of the Lutonix drug coated balloon for peripheral artery disease, and Jeff Mirviss will highlight these PI vascular solutions on Friday. We also strengthened our endoscopy portfolio and emerging market capabilities. In China, our endoscopy business announced a strategic alliance with Frankenman Medical. Frankenman joint venture combines the expertise of a global medical device leader and a local market expertise of a recognized leader in China\u2019s surgical device market. This JV will allow both players to reach more clinicians, to reach more patients. There were 1 million bile duct stone removal procedures being done annually in China as open surgical procedures. Converting these procedures from open surgical procedures to endoscopic procedures is expected to lead to better patient outcomes and health care economics, as well as drive enhanced endoscopy growth. Also in endoscopy, we announced the acquisition of Xlumena, which will enhance the position of Boston Scientific in the field of interventional endoscopic ultrasound called EUS therapeutics. Interventional EUS is a nonsurgical minimally invasive procedure that uses high frequency sound waves to produce detailed images of the GI tract and the adjacent organs. To complement EUS, our recently approved fine needle aspiration platform is often used to collect tissue samples for cancer diagnosis. These solutions complement our recent launch of the SPYGLASS Digital System and Advanix pancreatic stent. Dave Pierce will provide more insight into the rationale and opportunity for both Frankenman and Xlumena on Friday. Finally, we\u2019re excited about the transformational potential of our recent acquisition, the AMS urology portfolio. Upon closing, the AMS asset acquisition will nearly double the size of our uro business to $1 billion. Urology devices represent an attractive global market of 4 billion with large unmet patient needs and considerable international expansion opportunities. Upon closing of AMS, the combined business will create a comprehensive portfolio of leadership positions across five major segments. The deal also offers strong financial returns with an ROIC that exceeds our cost of capital by 2017 and an estimated adjusted EPS impact of $0.03 of accretion in 2016 and $0.07 of accretion in 2017. The AMS deal is also strategically compelling for BSC overall, as it furthers our goal of category leadership in each of our businesses. Overall, we\u2019ve been demonstrating a strong execution of our strategic and plan and we continue to believe that Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth given our strong pipeline, global expansion and significant opportunities for margin improvement. I would like to thank all of our employees for their winning spirit and their commitment to Boston Scientific. Now let me turn the call over to Dan for a more detailed review of financials. Dan Brennan : Thanks, Mike. I\u2019ll start with some overall perspective on the quarter before getting into the details. We generated adjusted EPS of $0.21 achieving the high end of our guidance range of $0.19 to $0.21 and representing 6% year-over-year growth. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacted Q1 adjusted EPS by $0.02 versus the $0.01 we had assumed in our Q1 guidance range. Excluding this unfavorable foreign exchange impact, Q1 adjusted EPS grew 18% year-over-year. The strong performance in Q1 was driven primarily by operational revenue growth and gross margin expansion. Our Q1 2015 adjusted operating margin of 22.5% achieved the high end of our full year adjusted operating margin guidance range and represents improvement of 250 basis points over Q1 of 2014. We continue to execute against our goals of consistent revenue growth and operating margin expansion, and despite the significant FX headwinds, our goal for full year 2015 remains double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Now I\u2019ll provide a more detailed review of our Q1 business performance and operating results. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of 2014 and all revenue growth rates are given on a year-over-year constant currency basis. For the first quarter of 2015, consolidated revenue of 1.768 billion represented operational revenue growth of 6%, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the divested Neurovascular business. On an as reported basis, revenue was flat year-over-year. Excluding an approximate 160 basis point contribution from the Bayer Interventional acquisition, organic revenue growth was 5% in the quarter. The foreign exchange impact on sales was a $117 million headwind compared to the prior year period, about $27 million worse than we assumed in our prior guidance range. I\u2019ll now provide more details on the revenue results for our seven businesses, which roll up into our three reporting segments. I\u2019ll start with MedSurg, where total group sales of $542 million grew 4% and adjusted operating margin was 29%, a decrease of 150 basis points over Q1 of 2014. Endoscopy sales grew 4% worldwide, with continued strength in Asia and Latin America and looking ahead, we believe the recent launch of our digital SPYGLASS and the acquisition of Xlumena, a leader in the field of endoscopic ultrasound therapies will help drive above-market growth in endoscopy for the full year 2015. Our recently announced Frankenman JV in China should also drive growth longer term. Urology and Women's Health worldwide sales grew 3% and strong urology performance in the U.S. and Europe offset challenges resulting from a softer Women's Health market and lower capital sales. Emerging markets revenue growth remains strong in the quarter growing north of 20%. To close out the MedSurg results, our worldwide Neuromodulation business posted solid sales growth of 6% versus a very difficult comparison in Q1 of last year when the business grew 23% globally. We believe our Q1 performance was in line with market and expect to grow faster than the market for the full year 2015, driven by the strong uptick of our 32-contact paddle and the strength of our pipeline, which we will discuss further at our upcoming Investor Day on Friday. Turning now to the Cardiovascular group, which consists of the Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Intervention divisions. Global sales for the group totaled $712 million and grew 10%. Cardiovascular group adjusted operating margins for the quarter of 30.6%, represented an impressive 630 basis point improvement year-over-year on strong stent volumes and manufacturing favorability. Within Cardiovascular, worldwide Interventional Cardiology sales of $495 million grew 8%. Globally, DES grew 7% with O-U.S. DES revenue growing double digits. DES growth was particularly strong in Asia, driven by Promus PREMIER, stent uptake in China and the launch of the Promus PREMIER large vessel stent in Japan. Worldwide complex PCI solutions grew 4% led by high-teens growth in imaging. We continue to see strong physician demand for our OptiCross IVUS catheter and ongoing launch of our Polaris imaging system. Overall, we remain pleased with our IC performance in the quarter and believe it validates our strategy to drive above-market growth by providing the interventional cardiologists with the broadest portfolio of technology and differentiated products to treat the most complex coronary cases. In structural heart, our LOTUS percutaneous valve grew 31% sequentially on a constant currency basis and WATCHMAN continued its strong growth with global revenue up more than 60% versus Q1 of last year. We look forward to highlighting our structure heart franchise more this Friday at our Investor Day. Peripheral Interventions delivered worldwide revenue growth of 14% driven by revenue from the acquired Bayer Interventional business, which grew 6% overall and 9% in PI. Excluding the contribution from Bayer Interventional, worldwide PI revenue grew 2%. U.S. legacy PI grew 5% in the quarter, partially offset by weakness in Japan and Latin America where we saw some procedural softness. Finally, I\u2019ll discuss our Rhythm Management group, which consists of our Electrophysiology and Cardiac Rhythm Management divisions. Worldwide Rhythm Management sales in Q1 of $514 million grew 4%. Rhythm Management's adjusted operating margin for Q1 of 14.3% represents a 160-basis point improvement year-over-year, the fifth consecutive quarter where Rhythm Management adjusted operating margins have improved 100 basis points or more over the prior year. We would expect more modest Rhythm Management margin expansion in Q2 and an acceleration in the second half of the year given the launch timing and favorable gross margin profile of the EMBLEM S-ICD and ACCOLADE pacing product lines. Worldwide Electrophysiology revenue was up 6% with both the U.S. and O-U.S. achieving that same 6% growth rate. As a reminder, Q1 is the first quarter where the acquired Bard EP business is fully in the base. We continued the limited market release for our Rhythmia mapping and navigation system with strong physician feedback given the system\u2019s higher fidelity images acquired in a fraction of the time required by competitor systems. We are encouraged that the early signs of stabilization in EP that we saw in Q4 of '14 have continued into Q1. For the Cardiac Rhythm Management division, Q1 worldwide sales increased 4%. Growth in CRM was led by Europe, which grew 6% for the third consecutive quarter. On a worldwide basis, defib sales of $335 million grew 5%. U.S. defib revenue posted solid growth of 6%, admittedly against an easier comparison driven by continued S-ICD system momentum, EL ICD, MINI ICD and our X4 quad CRT-D pulse generator as we continue to gain de novo ICD share. Worldwide pacer sales totaled $121 million and grew 3%. O-U.S. pacer revenue grew double digits and we believe we continued to gain share in the O-U.S. pacer market. U.S. pacer sales declined mid-single digits due to share losses to competitors with MRI capabilities. We\u2019ve consistently stated that our belief is that the CRM trends are best analyzed over multiple quarters. The 4% revenue growth worldwide CRM in Q1 brings our rolling 12-month growth rate to 4%, which we believe to be well in excess of the underlying combined pacemaker and defibrillator market. As Mike said, we would expect CRM growth to be more in line with the market for the balance of 2015 given tougher comps and competitors\u2019 launches. Turning now to the P&L, adjusted gross profit margin for the first quarter was 71.3%, up 140 basis points year-over-year. The increase was largely attributable to benefits from our value improvement and hedging programs partially offset by price erosion. As a result of our hedging program, FX positively impacted gross margin by 80 basis points. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $653 million or 37% of sales in Q1 2015. Our Q1 2015 adjusted SG&A rate was roughly flat to Q1 of 2014, and down approximately 90 basis points from the full year 2014 rate. We are encouraged by this lower rate of spend, as we begin to better leverage revenue growth in our structural heart franchise and realize the benefits from a cultural shift in our approach to spending. We continue to believe our full year 2014 SG&A rate will be in the range of 36.5% to 37.5%. Adjusted research and development expenses were $192 million in the first quarter or 10.8% of sales. This adjusted R&D rate is flat to Q1 of 2014 and slightly below our 2015 guidance due to efficiency gains and the timing of projects. We still believe our full year R&D rate will be in the range of 11% to 12% of revenue and are expecting a sequential uptick in R&D spending as a percent of revenue. Royalty expense was $17 million in the quarter or 1% of sales, which is consistent with our guidance. This royalty rate is down roughly 130 basis points year-over-year due to the renegotiation of a royalty agreement in Q2 of last year. On an adjusted basis, pre-tax operating income was $398 million in the quarter or 22.5% of sales, up 250 basis points year-over-year and 230 basis points from the full year 2014 rate. Adjusted pre-tax operating income grew 12% driven by a 38% increase in our Cardiovascular segment. GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items of $374 million, was $24 million in Q1 2015. The primary GAAP to adjusted items for the quarter included litigation-related charges of $193 million, contingent consideration expense of $27 million, restructuring-related charges of $22 million and amortization expense of $113 million. The $193 million in litigation-related net charges were predominately related to an increase in our transvaginal surgical mesh product liability reserves. As a reminder, our reserves cover both known and estimated future cases and claims asserted against us as well as cost of defense. Earlier this morning, as part of our earnings release filing, we disclosed the conditional settlement in the amount of approximately $119 million to resolve 2,790 cases and claims including a case in the district court of Dallas County where there is an approximate $35 million judgment. The settlement and the distribution of settlement funds to participating claimants are conditioned upon, among other things, achieving minimum required claimant participation thresholds. If the participation thresholds are not satisfied, we may terminate the agreement. We will fund the settlement with two payments to be made on or before October 1, 2015. Our total legal reserve for all legal matters of which mesh is included was $1.453 billion as of March 31, 2015, but keep in mind that our total legal reserve also includes the second installment of the J&J settlement for $300 million, which was actually paid out in April. Now I\u2019ll move on to other income and expense. Net interest expense for the quarter was $56 million, which is $2 million higher than Q1 of 2014. Other expense was $15 million and this consisted primarily of foreign exchange losses incurred during the quarter. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 97.5% on a reported basis, due primarily to the litigation-related charges that negatively impacted reported pre-tax income. Our effective tax rate was 13.1% on an adjusted basis, which includes slightly less than $2 million of discrete tax benefits in the quarter. We continue to expect our full year 2015 adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 15%. Finally, as mentioned, Q1 2015 adjusted EPS of $0.21 includes $0.02 of unfavorable FX and represents 6% year-over-year growth or 18% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, Q1 2015 EPS was breakeven and includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $287 million after tax. Breakeven on a GAAP basis in Q1 2015 compares to GAAP EPS of $0.10 in the prior year period. Moving on to the balance sheet, DSO of 59 days decreased three days compared to March of 2014, due primarily to strong collections in Europe. Days inventory on hand of 166 days was up 11 days compared to March of last year and up 10 days compared to December of 2014, due to higher inventory in advance of launches and lower cost of goods sold, driven primarily by standard cost improvements and favorable product mix. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $118 million compared to $161 million in Q1 last year. The decrease is largely due to the collection of long-dated European receivables in Q1 of 2014. We continue to expect our full year 2015 adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $1.3 billion. Capital expenditures were $46 million in Q1 2015 compared to $59 million in Q1 2014. The decrease is attributable to timing and we still expect CapEx to be roughly $260 million for the full year 2015. There were no share repurchases in the quarter consistent with our decision to temporarily suspend the share repurchase program following the announcement of the agreement to acquire AMS Men\u2019s Health and Prostate Health businesses. Near term, our capital allocation priorities are debt repayment, maintaining flexibility and tuck-in M&A. Beyond the 12 to 18-month suspension period, any continuation of our share repurchase program would be subject to business development opportunities, market conditions, our stock performance, regulatory trading windows and other factors. We now expect to end 2015 with 1.360 billion to 1.370 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. I\u2019d like to conclude with guidance for Q2 and full year 2015. For Q2 2015, we expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of 1.800 billion to 1.850 billion. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the headwind from FX should be approximately $140 million or 750 basis points relative to Q2 of 2014. On an operational basis, we expect consolidated Q2 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of 4% to 6%. We expect adjusted gross margin for the second quarter to be in the range of 70.5% to 71.5% prior to key new product launches in the second half of the year. Assuming a more normalized adjusted R&D rate in Q2 of 11% to 12%, we expect adjusted operating margin in the second quarter to be between 21% and 22%. Finally, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.20 to $0.22 per share and reported GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.09 to $0.11 per share. For the full year 2015, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $7.225 billion to $7.375 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 4% to 6% operationally versus our initial 3% to 6% operational growth guidance for the year, and down to flat on a reported basis. As a result of a stronger dollar at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to be roughly $450 million headwind for the full year 2015. Based on our strong Q1 and expectations for the second half of the year, we now expect our full year 2015 adjusted operating margin to be between 22% and 22.5%, an improvement of roughly 200 basis points at the midpoint over full year 2014. Despite a more significant FX headwind when we issued our initial 2015 guidance in early February, we\u2019re holding our full year adjusted EPS range at $0.88 to $0.92 per share. Previously, we assumed that unfavorable FX would negatively impact full year 2015 adjusted EPS by $0.04 or $0.01 per quarter. Based on current rates, we now expect FX to impact full year 2015 adjusted EPS by $0.06 to $0.07 but are not changing our adjusted EPS guidance. The high end of our adjusted EPS guidance range represents double-digit growth and based on current rates, approximately 15% growth at the midpoint when you exclude the impact of foreign exchange that I mentioned. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in the range of $0.32 to $0.38. I encourage you to check our Investor Relations Web site for Q1 2015 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q1 results, as well as Q2 and full year 2015 guidance including P&L line item guidance. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Suzie who will moderate the Q&A. Susie Lisa : Thanks, Dan. Karen, let's open it up to questions for the next 20 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Karen, please go ahead. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll go to Bob Hopkins, Bank of America, please go ahead. Robert Hopkins : Thanks. I appreciate you taking the question. So two quick things. First, I heard a litigation update there on mesh, and I was wondering I might have missed the numbers. I\u2019m just curious how many cases did that settlement represent? And then how many cases remain outstanding? Mike Mahoney : Thanks, Bob. What it represents is 2,970 cases that the conditional settlement will cover. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to Mike Weinstein, JPMorgan, please go ahead. Michael Weinstein : Wow, I hope I can get in my one question. So I\u2019ll ask maybe two questions before she cuts off. So first, could you just talk a little bit about the absorption of FX over the balance of the year and what are the offsets as you\u2019re absorbing the FX headwind? And then I think you gave a LOTUS commentary really for the first time, you talked about 31% sequential growth for LOTUS. I know they\u2019re small numbers still, but could you give us a sense of where revenues stand today? Thanks. Dan Brennan : Sure, Mike. I\u2019ll take the FX question. So as I mentioned, the initial guidance we gave was $0.04 of FX headwind at the EPS line, and now we see that as $0.06 to $0.07. So don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s important. Our goal I still double-digit EPS growth, so we hold the EPS range at $0.88 to $0.92 and we\u2019ll look to make tradeoffs in other parts of the P&L to offset that and still deliver within the $0.88 to $0.92, because at the high end of that range at $0.92 that\u2019s still double digit for the year versus last year. So basically tradeoffs within the rest of the P&L. Operator : David Lewis, Morgan Stanley -- Mike Mahoney : I\u2019ll just continue to comment just briefly on the LOTUS, we\u2019ll have quite a bit of time devoted to that on Friday during the Investor Day. At Investor Day we\u2019ll actually give targets for 2015 in our structural heart business as well as 2016. So we\u2019ll provide some more financial detail about an hour [ph] update there in terms of LOTUS. But overall, the program continues to build. We\u2019re enrolling our U.S. IDE trial REPRISE III. We expect to have the trial enrolled by year-end 2015 and we continue to gain share in accounts that we\u2019re selling in Europe. But we\u2019ll provide a more detailed update on Friday. Operator : David Lewis, Morgan Stanley, please go ahead. Susie Lisa : Karen? Operator : Yes, ma\u2019am. Susie Lisa : Yes, can you just allow them time for one follow-up question. Operator : Sure. Ma\u2019am, I\u2019m sorry. Susie Lisa : That\u2019s okay. Thank you. David Lewis : Great. Thanks. Good morning. So two questions. I guess, Dan, the first one, you were just coming back to margins. Looking at the last two quarters, 200 basis points year-on-year in the fourth quarter, 250 basis points this quarter. I appreciate there\u2019s some currency in those numbers and hedging gains, but you appear to be tracking well in excess of the more than 100 basis points you need to get to 25% in '17. So, is that a fair estimation that based on the results of last six months, you certainly are tracking above expectations that would get you to 25% in '17? Dan Brennan : Thanks, David. I think the way I\u2019d describe that is that we have good visibility to getting to that 25%. And we think last year, we ended at 20%, 20.2%. And then 2017 is the 25%, so we need to average more than 100 basis points per year in order to get to that 25% number in 2017. And obviously are very focused on doing that. We did raise the low end of the operating margin guidance range for the full year to 22%, from 21.5%. So now our guidance is 22% to 22.5% for this year. And feel like that\u2019s appropriate. Q2 should be a little bit lower, as I mentioned that. It should be between 21% and 22%. It\u2019s historically as it was last year, the lowest OI quarter in a particular year given a lot of incremental trade show and Congress spending with HRS and PCR and DDW and a bunch of others. So look for that to go down in Q2 and then feel comfortable with the 22% to 22.5% this year, and good visibility to the 25% in '17. David Lewis : Okay. Mike, just a quick one for you. This is an interesting quarter because we saw multiple distribution deals out of the company; Brainlab, Bard, Frankenman. Are these all just one-off deals or is this a trend in terms of where you want to spend your time and money across different products, different regions, and is it related at all to how you think about your margin expansion goals over the next two to three years? Thank you. Mike Mahoney : Yes. So we want to grow faster than the market and expand our margin throughout, double-digit EPS growth. And I think when you look at the rationale for many of those deals, it\u2019s really about driving category of leadership and being the preferred clinical partner to our physicians. So take the Brainlab example. So we have a terrific spinal cord stimulation business. We\u2019re very early with we think is a disruptive deep brain stimulation portfolio that we\u2019re enrolling the IDE trial now in the U.S. and we\u2019re approved in Europe. But we don\u2019t have as much scale in the neuro industry. So Brainlab has an excellent relationship with neurosurgeons. They have excellent guidance in mapping capabilities and so they will prove to be a smart distributor for us to align with to help build our commercial capabilities and broaden the depth of that portfolio. Similar with Bard, we have we believe the strongest portfolio in peripheral vascular. We recently acquired the Bayer division, atherectomy and thrombectomy and you saw the breakthrough results in our early results of our drug-eluting stent trial in terms of patency rates. But we feel that the Bard alliance is a great complement to that. It brings us into the U.S. sales capability now with the drug-eluting balloon. And so we really use these JVs to help fill in potential areas in the portfolio that maybe gaps as we continue to drive category of leadership. Operator : Thank you. Rick Wise, Stifel, please go ahead. Frederick Wise : Good morning, everybody. Maybe Dan, just to start with you, can you talk \u2013 can you break down, give us a little more color on the operating segment performance. Obviously, Cardiovascular outstanding sequentially year-over-year, Rhythm Management excellent year-over-year, a little lower sequentially; MedSurg a little weaker. I\u2019m not sure I understand the drivers behind each. Can you give us a little more there? Dan Brennan : Sure. I think starting with the Rhythm Management one, I think that\u2019s what you\u2019ve seen over the last 12 to 18 months, and that\u2019s more than 100 basis points per quarter increases in Rhythm Management and again that\u2019s a huge focus for Joe Fitzgerald and the team there. So I think that\u2019s for Q1. It\u2019s in line with what you\u2019ve seen in terms of the activities that are driving that. CV obviously with the more than 600 basis points, that\u2019s a bit of an anomaly. That generally is in the mid to high 20s. So that\u2019s driven by a favorable product mix within IC, as you would expect. When drug-eluting stents do well and when overall the mix within IC does well, that drives more profitability within IC. I wouldn\u2019t expect to see 30.6 going forward. I\u2019d expect that to go back into the more traditional mid to high 20s. But obviously pleased to see that, given the mix that we had in the quarter. And the MedSurg, that\u2019s lower than you\u2019d expect to see at the 29. But overall, again, not a worry there. The growth was a little bit slower in urology at 3% and endoscopy at 4%. They drive \u2013 particularly endoscopy drives a significant amount of the profitability in the MedSurg franchise. As Mike and I both mentioned, we look for those numbers from a growth perspective to increase in Q2 and in the back half and that should take care of the MedSurg. I\u2019m not worried about the MedSurg profitability. Frederick Wise : Okay. And Mike, just a strategic question building on David Lewis\u2019 question a little bit. You talked about tuck-in M&A as a priority. Obviously, you keep steadily adding to the portfolio in multiple ways. Can you just give us your latest thoughts on \u2013 I mean are you looking for tuck-in deals, are you looking for technology, are you looking for O-U.S. more than U.S.? How do we think about your priorities? Are you just being opportunistic? Mike Mahoney : I think we\u2019re being pretty efficient. The performance of top line growth at 6 [ph], EPS growth ex-FX at 18 and strong margin improvement 250. And so really it goes back to the strategy of category leadership. And so we want to make sure the acquisitions we look at, it fits our strategic rationale and deliver strong financial returns. The AMS acquisition certainly meets this criteria in terms of nearly doubling the sales growth and ROIC that hits our targets at year three. And some of these alliances are a very cost effective way to extend our category leadership globally, whether it\u2019d be the Bard alliance that we talked about or Brainlab. The Frankenman JV, we\u2019re excited about it. It\u2019s our first JV into China. That business has been growing plus 25% and gives us stronger local capabilities that will build on our R&D and manufacturing capabilities, and we think it will accelerate the growth in endoscopy. So we\u2019re also very active in early private equity venture activity. So all these point towards either alliances, JVs or acquisitions that reinforce our category leadership goal and driving growth at or faster than market and driving margin improvement. Operator : Thank you. Bruce Nudell, Credit Suisse, please go ahead. Matthew Keeler : Hi, guys. This is Matt in for Bruce. Can you hear me okay? Susie Lisa : Yes, Matt. Mike Mahoney : Can hear you fine, Matt, yes. Matthew Keeler : Great. So it looks like just on top line guidance, FX got worse. Excluding that, you raised the top in 15 million to 65 million, somewhere in there, and I wondered if you can comment on what\u2019s driving that, and specifically around what magnitude of sales you\u2019re expecting from these recent partnerships and acquisitions; Brainlab, Frankenman, Bard, Xlumena? Mike Mahoney : We continue to see very strong growth in our core business. The majority of our business is growing faster than market based on recently approved pipeline. We had, as you know, the EMBLEM product in CRM recently approved. We\u2019ll launch that in a more meaningful way in second half of the year. So we expect to see strong uptick of that, the WATCHMAN approval; so very strong cadence of product approvals in our core business. We\u2019ll have synergy approved hopefully in fourth quarter in the U.S. And then consistent with our strat plan, we\u2019re moving into some new adjacencies. Our TAVR portfolio is beginning to pick up, increased traction in Europe and we continue to strengthen our EP business. As Dan talked about, we\u2019re not quite there yet but we did 6% in the quarter in EP and we\u2019re beginning to build capabilities in mapping and make some advances in our therapeutic catheter line. So we kind of walked through all of the businesses, but essentially we\u2019re pleased that in most of our business we continue to grow faster than market based on innovation and strong commercial performance. And many of our exciting pipeline therapies will be discussed this Friday and that gives us quite a bit of confidence as we look out over the longer term period, the strat plan. Matthew Keeler : Thanks. And just one follow up on the S-ICD. You\u2019ve talked in the past about commercial coverage. Can you remind us sort of how far along you are there and are you kind of \u2013 when you get to 100% or as close to that as you expect to end up? Dan Brennan : I\u2019m not sure you ever get to 100%, Matt. We\u2019ve had some good wins as we exited 2014 and into the first quarter of '15, so feel like that\u2019s becoming less of a headwind on that relative to the S-ICD. Operator : Thank you. Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo, please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just two numbers that you normally give us, I didn\u2019t see in the release, U.S. DES growth and emerging market growth this quarter. And I had a follow up. Dan Brennan : Larry, this is Dan. So on the DES, I think that\u2019s a trend for us just from a competitive perspective and the fact that we\u2019re obviously a lot more diversified than we were when we started that process many, many years, I think we\u2019ll give the global number and then potentially some growth rates, but not the specific numbers similar to some of our competitors on the DES front. Larry Biegelsen : So no U.S. DES growth, Dan? Dan Brennan : We did give \u2013 we said it was low double digit, I believe \u2013 in double digits. Larry Biegelsen : That\u2019s U.S.? Dan Brennan : That was O-U.S. Larry Biegelsen : Got it, all right. And then emerging markets, Dan? Dan Brennan : We didn\u2019t give the specific emerging markets. I know Mike quoted a couple of specifics within countries with China in the mid 20s, but nothing specific. Mike Mahoney : I did say it was 7% global DES growth and very balanced across the regions. Larry Biegelsen : All right, that\u2019s helpful. And then for my follow up, I\u2019m trying to understand what\u2019s in the guidance, Dan. So you did 5% organic this quarter by my math and my math might be wrong. We have 2% to 4% organic for the second quarter and I guess what is the full year organic growth \u2013 what\u2019s included for acquisitions? Is AMS in that new number or is that excluding AMS? And if it includes AMS, it looks like the organic growth rate that\u2019s implied for Q2 and for full year 2015, I recognize AMS isn\u2019t expected to close until the third quarter would be below the 5% that you did this quarter. So maybe if you could kind of just bridge what\u2019s in the guidance and what your kind of organic growth expectations are, that would be helpful. Thanks. Dan Brennan : The easy one is we don\u2019t include AMS until that acquisition closes. So that is out of our guidance going forward until that acquisition would close. As you think of the rest of the year, particularly as you get into Q3 and Q4, there are some much more challenging comps particularly in IC. So we grew overall as a company. Operationally we grew 7% in Q3 and 7% in Q4. So the comps get a little more difficult as we get into the back half of the year, so feel like that 4% to 6% operational growth which would be 3% to 5% for the full year is a good number for organic growth. Mike Mahoney : 3% to 5%, that\u2019s fair. Dan Brennan : Yes, 3% to 5% organic, which we describe as excluding the acquisition \u2013 excluding Bayer would be 3% to 5% and operational 4% to 6% for the full year. Operator : Thank you. Bob Hopkins, Bank of America, please go ahead. Robert Hopkins : Sorry about that. So just the one follow up I wanted to ask was on the endo business. Obviously, that\u2019s been a very consistent grower for you guys. It was maybe slightly below what we were looking for this quarter, so maybe just some commentary this quarter. And much more importantly, some commentary on do you think that this is a business that can sustain at least mid-single digit growth, so just some comments on this division. Thank you. Mike Mahoney : It\u2019s Mike. We have a lot of confidence in the endoscopy business. Dave will highlight it for about 20 minutes on Friday. So last year, we grew 5%. First quarter, we\u2019re down a little bit, 4%. We have a number of new product launches that just really are in process right now with the digital SPYGLASS being the primary one, which is beginning to ramp up in terms of its deliverability. And also some launches that Dave will discuss in the second half. So we have quite a bit of confidence that our endoscopy business will continue to be a strong mid-single digit grower and continue to drive operating margin improvement potentially with some upside in the emerging markets with the Xlumena acquisition and the Frankenman JV. Robert Hopkins : Great. We\u2019ll see you Friday. Mike Mahoney : Thanks, Bob. Susie Lisa : Karen, we\u2019ll take two more please. Operator : Brooks West, Piper Jaffray, please go ahead. Brooks West : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two quick ones from me. Dan, you said AMS wasn\u2019t in the guidance. If we did want to add that to our numbers, you talked about a Q3 close. Should we just go ahead and throw in a one quarter of revenue for that business, about the scale you\u2019ve described it or any guidance there would be helpful? And then I\u2019m hoping you can help us a little bit with how to think about the U.S. WATCHMAN launch and how that might contribute in the second half. Thanks. Dan Brennan : Sure. I\u2019ll take the first one. On AMS, it\u2019s roughly 100 million a quarter, so that\u2019s \u2013 and divide that by the months. And whenever we were to close \u2013 whatever your assumption is for closed, just add that in. Brooks West : Great. And then anything incremental you can help us with how to think about the U.S. WATCHMAN launch? Mike Mahoney : We\u2019ll spend some time on it Friday. We\u2019re focused on our current 50 sites that did the original IDE trial and we\u2019re opening those sites up again with the training programs. We\u2019ve built up a significant capability with our training and proctoring and we\u2019ll be reopening those sites beginning this quarter in the second half. And then after those first 50 sites are kind of reengaged, we\u2019ll open up 50 new centers. So we have quite tremendous interest in the portfolio and the platform amongst electro-physiologists and interventional cardiologists. A lot of backlog patients that are waiting for it. So hopefully by the end of the year, we anticipate about 100 sites will be up and running with WATCHMAN. And then we see a market opportunity of about 400 sites over the next few years as we continue to develop and open up new centers. Brooks West : That\u2019s perfect. Thanks, guys. Operator : Lastly, we\u2019ll go to the line of Jayson Bedford, Raymond James & Associates, please go ahead. Jayson Bedford : Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask about the peripheral segment. Growth accelerated nicely from back half '14 levels even if we exclude Bayer. It seems like the rollout of \u2013 or the broader rollout of drug-coated balloons didn\u2019t have much of an impact on the quarter. So I guess first, is that fair? And then second, did the Bard agreement help out at all in the quarter? Thanks. Mike Mahoney : The Bard agreement is early, so we haven\u2019t seen \u2013 we\u2019ll see more benefit of the Bard deal kind of the back half, if you will, of second quarter and really in the second half of 2015. So really just beginning of tying down the loose ends of that agreement and we\u2019re excited about that, but we didn\u2019t see any impact of the Bard agreement in the first quarter. And the overall PI business, we\u2019re excited about that, because the Bayer integration is going quite well. We\u2019ve done the commercial integrations between the team and so we\u2019re excited about the second half opportunities with our PI business given the portfolio, and very encouraged longer term as you look at the new Eluvia data that was highlighted this morning. Dan Brennan : And encouraged with the 9% -- this is Dan, the 9% in the quarter for the Bayer business, because one of the reasons we acquired that business was to get into the fast growing atherectomy segment and to get a leadership position in a thrombectomy market. And with the integration ongoing and seeing that 9% overall growth for PI in the Bayer segment, that was nice to see as well. Susie Lisa : Karen, we\u2019ll take just one more please and then conclude. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll go to Kristen Stewart, Deutsche Bank, please go ahead. Kristen Stewart : Hi. Thanks so much for allowing me in last moment. I couldn\u2019t resist but ask Dan a tax question. No, I\u2019m just kidding. Mike I was wondering if you could just talk very high level just with some of the dynamics that we\u2019re seeing from an M&A perspective with Cardinal buying the Cordis business. I\u2019m sure you know Don quite well from the J&J days and just thinking out strategically and kind of what their strategy is from a PPI perspective, how do you view that, if at all, any risk to the base interventional cardiology business, excluding obviously stents? Mike Mahoney : Yes, so we\u2019ve been competing with Cordis for a number of years. About 70% plus of their business is outside the U.S. And we\u2019ve invested a lot in our interventional cardiology and structural heart and our peripheral business to drive category leadership. We have quite a bit of momentum. And so we\u2019re comfortable on a couple fronts. We\u2019re comfortable but we\u2019re certainly always pushing to grow harder. One is I think we have some highly clinically differentiated platforms with structural heart, with synergy, with atherectomy and thrombectomy and our drug-eluting capabilities. So we think we have very unique innovation there. At the same time, the more commoditized products which is where really Cordis was, are very good, extremely low cost, very excellent manufacturing processes for those capabilities. So, many of those product lines are already commoditized today, many of those products aren\u2019t driving the growth of the business and we manufactured them at great scale at very strong margins. So we always want to be mindful of new competitors but we continue to invest in not only innovation but also in lean best practices and efficiencies to ensure that we can manage some of the pricing challenges that we typically run into. Kristen Stewart : Okay. Perfect. And then just I guess for clarification purposes on Friday, I know you mentioned in some instances you\u2019d be giving some aspirational goals for 2015 and 2016 for products. Can you just maybe give us an outline of what to expect? Will you be updating your longer term goals beyond 2017 or just kind of going through product by product and giving kind of the 2015 and '16 outlooks? Dan Brennan : I think that will give you a reason to come, Kristen. Yes, I wouldn\u2019t want to tell you all the things that we\u2019ll show but good opportunity for people to come on Friday and hear what we have to say. Kristen Stewart : All right. Well, I\u2019m coming irrespective. See you on Friday. Dan Brennan : Okay. Thanks. Susie Lisa : All right. With that, we\u2019d like to conclude the call.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host. Ms. Susan Lisa, please go ahead. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Katy. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, President and Chief Executive Officer and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q2 2015 results which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will begin our prepared remarks with an update on our business progress and his perspectives on the quarter. Dan will then review our overall Q2 2015 financial results as well as guidance for full-year 2015 and Q3 of 2015. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Keith Dawkins and Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate, and other similar words. They include among, other things, statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance including sales, margins, earnings and other Q3 and full-year 2015 guidance, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend, and other expenses. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause those differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs and 8-Ks filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Susie, and good morning, everyone. In Q2, Boston Scientific posted another strong result as we continued to execute on our long-term commitments. We delivered worldwide operational revenue growth of 6%, 10% adjusted operating income growth and 12% adjusted EPS growth excluding a $0.02 negative impact from foreign exchange. These results reflect the high performance of our global teams, our differentiated portfolio and the diversification of our business. As detailed in our May Investor Day meeting, our company remains focused on high performance. We aim to drive mid-single digit operational revenue growth and consistent operating margin expansion, which in turn will drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Dan will detail our commitment to this goal with full-year 2015 adjusted EPS guidance of $0.88 to $0.92, which is unchanged from our original guidance in February. Importantly, we've maintained our EPS guidance despite a $0.06 to $0.07 negative impact from FX versus our original expectation of a $0.04 negative impact. We remain focused on overcoming these FX challenges to deliver against our original adjusted EPS guidance range. Now I'll provide some highlights on Q2. Dan will review the financials and Q3 guidance and then we'll take your questions. Please note that in my remarks all references to growth are on a year-over-year constant currency basis unless otherwise specified. Now for a few highlights for the quarter, we delivered broad based global revenue of 6%, on target with our goal for consistent revenue growth as we've now grown revenues 6% or better for four consecutive quarters. This solid and balanced growth is driven by robust execution in our core businesses, strong new product launches, increased traction from our Structural Heart business, continued international expansion and leverage from our acquisitions. Our MedSurg segment is building momentum and each business accelerated year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 compared to Q1. Endoscopy's year-over-year growth rate improved from 4% in Q1 to 6% in Q2 and this growth is fueled by our new SpyGlass Digital launch and our expanded capabilities in endoscopic ultrasound which is the fast and emerging growing field of minimally invasive procedures. Neuromodulation revenue accelerated in Q2 growing 9%. This growth was led by continued adoption of our U.S. market-leading Precision Spectra spinal cord stimulation platform, which offers differentiated capabilities via our Illumina 3D neural targeting and CoverEdge 32 contact paddle. Importantly, we are now entering the primary cell non-rechargeable market in Europe with the launch of Precision Novi. With the Novi technology, we have leveraged the unique and flexible capabilities of the Spectra platform. We're really excited about its potential to take share in a sizeable market that is incremental to BSC. Turning to Urology and Women's Health, we also improved its top line growing 7% in second quarter after a 3% growth in first quarter. The acceleration was driven by a comprehensive portfolio and our ongoing international expansion efforts. We are excited about the pending Q3 closing of the AMS male urology acquisition as we are confident that this deal will further strengthen our category leading global urology franchise. Switching gears, our Cardiovascular group grew 10% in second quarter, with Interventional Cardiology outpacing our market growth estimate with a 7% increase in sales. Growth was well balanced across our IC franchises and geographic regions. In DES, the SYNERGY Stent now represents approximately 30% of our European DES sales and it remains on track for year-end 2015 U.S. approval. In SYNERGY, with its unique bio-absorbable polymer coating and thin strut is designed from the ground up to promote healing. And we're excited to bring this premium and differentiated workhorse stent to the U.S. and Japanese market. Also as evidence of our commitment to offering the broadest IC portfolio, we announced earlier in the week that we have initiated the FAST study of our first fully resorbable drug-eluting scaffold system. FAST is a true second generation fully resorbable scaffold that seeks to address the limitations of the current commercially available devices. We expect to enter CE Mark countries with a second generation FRS device in 2017. Our PCI Guidance business also continued to deliver strong results and we recently submitted our 510(k) for U.S. clearance of our integrated fractional flow reserve imaging system. We look forward to a limited market release in both the U.S. and Europe in Q4 of this year. And finally, the IC performance was fueled by our strengthening Structural Heart business, which includes our LOTUS percutaneous aortic valve and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device. We believe that we're uniquely positioned for the long-term to assist hospitals and physicians with a growing Structural Heart demand due to the unique capabilities of both WATCHMAN and LOTUS. LOTUS continues to penetrate the European market, and we're executing on the pipeline that we detailed at Investor Day. Our clinical evidence continues to build and we remain on track to complete enrollment in both our REPRISE III IDE and RESPOND post-approval study by year-end 2015. The first 100 days of the U.S. WATCHMAN launch have been very successful and we expect to complete rollout of the first 100 accounts by year-end. We're very pleased with the implant success rate and the high quality of patient outcomes thus far, which reflect our controlled rollout and proven training program. We have a great deal of clinical evidence demonstrating that WATCHMAN can uniquely benefit a large global patient population. And in terms of U.S. reimbursement, we will understand more about the national coverage decision, as well as the new technology add-on payment in the back-half of 2015. So overall, we're very excited about our progress in Structural Heart and expect to deliver full year 2015 Structural Heart revenue at the high-end of the $75 million to $100 million goal that we provided at our May 1 Investor Day. In Peripheral Interventions, the core business continues to execute and the integration of the legacy Bayer business is going extremely well. Bayer grew at a double-digit rate in Q2 and we're seeing strong commercial and operational synergies with our Peripheral business. We're also encouraged with the early results of our commercial partnership with C. R. Bard and the Lutonix drug-coated balloon technology. Now, I'll provide comments on CRM. On our first quarter earnings call, we projected a slowdown in our worldwide CRM sales for the balance of 2015 due to difficult comparisons, replacement headwinds and competitive launches, particularly in the U.S. Q2 global CRM sales did in fact slow to 1% decline, and we continue to anticipate some softness in U.S. CRM sales through year-end 2015. But it's very important to highlight that our European CRM business delivered mid-single-digit growth for the fifth consecutive quarter. In Europe, we are estimating we are taking share with a differentiated portfolio, including full CRT-D and CRT-P Quad systems, ACCOLADE 3T MRI safe pacemakers, and our second generation S-ICD EMBLEM. In addition, our industry-leading EnduraLife battery technology continued to differentiate Boston Scientific and set us apart with multiple new independent and contemporary longevity datasets that were recently presented at HRS. We believe device longevity plays an important role in reducing costly complications associated with replacement procedures and reduces overall healthcare cost. These European CRM results are encouraging and relevant. As we expect to launch the 4 Quad in the U.S. in early 2016 and we are transitioning into a full launch of EMBLEM S-ICD in the U.S. in Q3. Additionally, we expect to have Ready MRI in the U.S. by year end 2015. So the products driving above market growth in Europe are expected to be available soon in the U.S. as well as Japan. In EP, we're beginning to build momentum with 9% growth in second quarter led by our differentiated mapping and navigation system. Rhythmia is now accelerating the pace of its global rollout and physician praise of speed, clarity and density of imaging. We're also encouraged by key upcoming launches in EP such as our navigation enabled IntellaNav, Open-Irrigated Ablation Catheter in Europe slated for Q3 2015. So stepping back to look across all the businesses, our 6% operational revenue growth reflects the strong diversification of our portfolio, our focus on innovation and our ongoing globalization effort. In Q2, U.S., Europe and Asia regions all grew 6% and the emerging markets grew 12% led by 21% revenue growth in China. Importantly, we believe that we are well positioned to sustain our global performance as several key new product launches are early in their rollout. To highlight a few in Q2, our WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device launched in the U.S. SpyGlass Digital began its rollout. Our next generation EMBLEM S-ICD launched in Europe and our primary cell spinal cord stimulation system, Novi, launched in Europe. All of these launches are off to a good start due to the unmet needs they address for patients and the clinical differentiation in the marketplace. And finally, we continue to execute on our margin expansion goals. On the back of strong adjusted operating margin expansion of 230 basis points versus Q2 2014, we have high visibility on achieving our 25% adjusted operating margin goal in 2017 and continuing improvement beyond 2017. So overall, we're executing well globally and delivering on our strategic plan commitments. We continue to believe that Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to deliver consistent, mid-single digit growth and double digit adjusted EPS growth excluding FX. Given our strong pipeline, global expansion opportunities and significant opportunities for margin improvement. I'd like to thank our employees for their tremendous winning spirit and their commitment to the company. Now, let me turn the call over to Dan for a detailed review of our financials. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Mike. I'll start with some overall perspective on the quarter before getting into the details. We generated adjusted EPS of $0.22, achieving the high-end of our guidance range of $0.20 to $0.22 and representing 2% year-over-year growth. Excluding the $0.02 unfavorable foreign exchange impact, Q2 adjusted EPS grew 12% year-over-year. The strong performance in Q2 was driven primarily by operational revenue growth and gross margin expansion. Our Q2 2015 adjusted operating margin of 22.1% exceeded the high end of our Q2 adjusted operating margin guidance range of 21% to 22% and represents improvement of 230 basis points over Q2 of 2014. This is the second consecutive quarter where total company adjusted operating margin expanded by at least 200 basis points over the prior year quarter, and despite significant FX headwind, our goal for the full year 2015 remains double digit adjusted EPS growth. Now, I'll provide a detailed review of our Q2 business performance and operating results. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of 2014 and all revenue growth rates are given on a year-over-year constant currency basis. For the second quarter of 2015 consolidated revenue of $1.843 billion represented operational revenue growth of 6%, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the divested Neurovascular business. On an as-reported basis, revenue declined 2% year-over-year. Excluding an approximate 170 basis point contribution from the Bayer Interventional acquisition, organic revenue growth was 4% in the quarter. The foreign exchange impact on sales was a $141 million headwind compared to the prior-year period and it was only $1 million worse than we assumed in our Q2 guidance range. I will now provide more details on the revenue results for our seven businesses which roll up into the three reporting segments. I'll start with MedSurg where the total group sales of $583 million grew 7% and adjusted operating margin was 30.4%. This represents an increase of 20 basis points over Q2 of 2014 and 140 basis points sequentially. Endoscopy sales grew (14:50) 6% worldwide, driven by double-digit growth in biliary, the largest franchise, fueled by SpyGlass DS and the AXIOS Stent System from our recent acquisition of Xlumena. Latin America continued to stand out with growth north of 30%. Urology and Women's Health posted solid worldwide sales growth of 7%, driven by strong Urology performance in the U.S. and Europe. Pelvic Floor revenue grew low single digits globally against a market that we believe is down slightly. Emerging markets revenue growth was impressive in the quarter, up almost 40%. To close out the MedSurg results, our worldwide Neuromodulation business posted solid sales growth of 9% and we're encouraged by the early launch of our Precision NOVI primary cell device in Europe, which gives us our first entry into a $200 million plus OUS non-rechargeable market. Turning now to the Cardiovascular group, which consists of the Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions divisions, global sales for the group totaled $743 million and grew 10%. Cardiovascular group adjusted operating margin for the quarter of 30.5% represented a 440 basis point improvement year-over-year on strong stent volumes and U.S. WATCHMAN revenue contribution. We expect Cardiovascular segment adjusted operating margin expansion to moderate in the second half of the year primarily due to the timing of clinical spend. Worldwide interventional Cardiology sales of $515 million grew 7%. Growth in IC was strong across all regions, with the U.S. up 8%, Europe up 5%, and Asia, up 11%. DES sales grew low single digits globally, with Asia's DES revenue growing double digit for the second straight quarter. This was driven by the continued strength of the Promus PREMIER stent in Japan and strong uptake of Promus PREMIER in China. Worldwide complex PCI solutions also grew low single digit led by solid performance in Imaging, particularly in Japan. Our Structural Heart franchise was the largest contributor to worldwide IC revenue growth in the quarter, and as Mike mentioned, we're comfortable with the high end of our $75 million to $100 million revenue goal for the full year 2015. The strong growth in IC is a combination of the complex PCI and DES businesses growing slightly above market and strong contributions from WATCHMAN and LOTUS. The comps in our IC business become much more challenging in the second half of this year. We remain focused on driving above market growth by providing the interventional cardiologist with the broadest portfolio of technology and differentiated products to treat the most complex coronary cases. Peripheral Interventions delivered worldwide revenue growth of 16% driven by strong double-digit growth in the acquired Bayer business and 4% growth in the legacy Boston Scientific PI business. The distribution deal with C. R. Bard for their Lutonix Drug Coated Balloon drove pull through of our broader PI portfolio and Interventional Oncology grew mid-single digits on the performance of new product launches and a focus on the interventional radiologist globally. Turning now to our Rhythm Management group which includes our Electrophysiology and Cardiac Rhythm Management division, worldwide Rhythm Management sales in Q2 of $517 million were flat to Q2 of 2014. Rhythm Management's adjusted operating margin for Q2 of 14.1% represents a 190 basis point improvement year-over-year, the sixth consecutive quarter of Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin improvement of 100 basis points or more versus the prior year. As a reminder, we expect Rhythm Management's adjusted operating margin expansion to accelerate in the second half of the year given the launch timing and favorable gross margin profile of the EMBLEM S-ICD and ACCOLADE product lines. We believe that we can drive at least 200 basis points of improvement in the second half of 2015 versus the first-half rate of 14.1%, marking significant progress towards our goal of achieving a Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin north of 20% by 2017. Worldwide Electrophysiology revenue was up 9% with high single-digit growth in both the U.S. and Europe, and we are encouraged by our first-half performance in EP and the capabilities we are building globally. For the Cardiac Rhythm Management division, Q2 worldwide sales decreased 1%, consistent with expectations given replacement headwinds, difficult comparisons, and competitive launches. On a worldwide basis, defib sales of $335 million grew 1%. U.S. defib revenue declined slightly on replacement headwinds and continued market penetration of CRT-D Quad systems. As Mike mentioned, we're excited to transition to the full U.S. launch of EMBLEM in Q3 and launch our own Quad system in the first half of 2016. Worldwide pacer sales totaled $125 million and declined 4%. The decline was primarily U.S. driven as we experienced share loss to competitors with MRI safe capabilities. We expect to have our MRI compatible pacemaker approved in the U.S. in Q4 of this year. As we communicated last quarter, we expect global CRM year over year revenue growth to be relatively flat in the second half of this year. Despite this flat revenue outlook, we expect to deliver significant year over year adjusted operating margin expansion in Rhythm Management. Turning now to the P&L. Adjusted gross profit margin for the second quarter was 71.3%, up 100 basis points year over year. Gains from our value improvement programs and our FX hedging program positively impacted gross margin by 150 basis points and 100 basis points respectively and this was offset partially by 150 basis points of negative price and mix. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $688 million or 37.3% of sales in the quarter. Our Q2 2015 adjusted SG&A rate was down 90 basis points from Q2 of last year and we continue to believe our full-year 2015 adjusted SG&A rate will be in the range of 36.5% to 37.5%. Adjusted research and development expenses were $200 million in the second quarter or 10.9% of sales. This adjusted R&D rate is roughly flat both sequentially and year over year. We still believe our full year adjusted R&D rate will be in the range of 11% to 12% of revenue and are expecting a sequential uptick in R&D spending as a percent of revenue particularly in the Cardiovascular segment. Royalty expense was $18 million in the quarter or 1% of sales, consistent with our guidance. On an adjusted basis, pre-tax operating income was $408 million in the quarter or 22.1% of sales, up 230 basis points year-over-year and exceeding our Q2 adjusted operating margin guidance of 21% to 22%. Adjusted pre-tax operating income grew 10% driven by a 28% increase in our Cardiovascular segment. GAAP operating income which includes GAAP to adjusted items of $189 million was $219 million in Q2 2015. The primary GAAP to adjusted items for the quarter included restructuring related charges of $16 million, contingent consideration expense of $19 million, and amortization expense of $116 million. As of June 30, our total legal reserve was $1.117 billion. Now, I'll move on to other income and expense. During the quarter, we completed an offering of $1.850 billion of senior notes, with an average interest rate of 3.4%, arranged a new bank term loan of $750 million and refinanced a $2 billion revolving credit facility with a new $2 billion revolving facility maturing in 2020. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the notes offering to redeem $1 billion of outstanding notes due in 2015 and 2016 with an average interest rate of 6.3%. The remaining net proceeds of the notes offering, together with the borrowings under the $750 million term loan, are expected to fund the purchase price for the AMS male urology portfolio. Interest expense for the quarter was $106 million, which includes a pre-tax charge of approximately $45 million associated with the senior note refinancing. Excluding this charge, our interest expense for the quarter was $61 million, compared to $54 million in Q2 of last year, and the increase was primarily due to a one month period during which we incurred interest on the $1.850 billion of newly issued notes as well as the $1 billion of outstanding notes due in 2015 and 2016 prior to their redemption. Our next bond maturity of $250 million is not due until January 2017. Other expense was $8 million, and this consisted primarily of foreign exchange losses incurred during the quarter. Our tax rate for the quarter was 2.9% on a reported basis and 13% on an adjusted basis. Our Q2 adjusted tax rate includes slightly more than $1 million of unfavorable discrete tax items. And we continue to expect our full year 2015 adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 15%. Finally, as mentioned, Q2 2015 adjusted EPS of $0.22 includes $0.02 of unfavorable FX and represents 2% year-over-year growth or 12% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, Q2 2015 EPS was $0.08 and includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $192 million after tax. GAAP EPS of $0.08 compares to breakeven on a GAAP basis in the prior year period. Moving on to the balance sheet, DSO of 59 days decreased four days compared to June of 2014 due primarily to strong collections in Europe. Days inventory on-hand of 163 days was up 10 days compared to June of last year, and up seven days compared to December of 2014 due to higher inventory in advance of launches, and lower cost of goods sold driven primarily by standard cost improvements and favorable product mix. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $406 million, compared to $262 million in Q2 of last year. This increase was primarily due to higher adjusted operating profit, lower capital expenditures, and a continued focus on working capital management. We continue to expect our full year 2015 adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $1.3 billion. Capital expenditures were $46 million in Q2 of this year compared to $64 million in Q2 of last year. The decrease is attributable to timing and we still expect CapEx to be roughly $260 million for the full year 2015. There were no share repurchases in the quarter, consistent with our decision to temporarily suspend the share repurchase program following the announcement of the agreement to acquire AMS men's health and prostate health businesses. Near-term, our capital allocation priorities are debt repayment, maintaining flexibility and tuck-in M&A. Beyond the 12 to 18 month suspension period, any continuation of our share repurchase program would be subject to business development opportunities, market conditions, our stock performance, regulatory trading windows and other factors consistent with prior guidance and we expect to end 2015 with between 1.360 billion shares, and 1.370 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. And since we plan to keep the buyback suspended for some or all of 2016, we expect the 2015 trend in fully diluted weighted average shares to continue into 2016. I'd like to conclude with guidance for Q3 and full year 2015. As a reminder, AMS is excluded from our guidance as the transaction has not yet closed. For Q3 2015, we expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $1.790 billion to $1.840 billion. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, we estimate the headwind from FX should be approximately $125 million or 680 basis points relative to Q3 of 2014. On an operational basis, we expect consolidated Q3 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of plus 4% to plus 6%. We expect adjusted gross margin for the third quarter to be in a range of 71.5% to 72.5%, reflecting the favorable gross margin profile of key new product launches. Assuming a more normalized adjusted R&D rate in Q3 of 11% to 12%, we expect adjusted operating margin in the third quarter to be approximately 22.5%, plus or minus 25 basis points. Finally, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.21 to $0.23 per share and reported GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.10 to $0.13 per share. For the full year 2015, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $7.275 billion to $7.375 billion, which represents a year-over-year growth of 4% to 6% operationally. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, we expect the FX headwind to be roughly $460 million for the full year 2015. Based on our strong first half and expectations for the second half of the year, we now expect our full-year 2015 adjusted operating margin to be approximately 22.5% plus or minus 25 basis points. This represents an improvement of roughly 230 basis points over the full-year 2014. And as a reminder, our initial full-year 2015 adjusted operating margin guidance contained a midpoint of 22%, which we raised to 22.25% on our Q1 earnings call, and our current guidance of 22.5% represents the second consecutive quarter where we will have raised the midpoint of our full-year adjusted operating margin by 25 basis points. Finally, we are reiterating our full-year adjusted EPS guidance range of $0.88 to $0.92. Recall, this range includes a $0.06 to $0.07 impact from unfavorable FX. We're proud that our team is focused on overcoming these FX headwinds to deliver against our original guidance range. The high end of our adjusted EPS guidance range represents double-digit growth and based on current rates, approximately 15% growth at the midpoint when you exclude the impact of foreign exchange. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.28 to $0.34. I encourage you to check our Investor Relations website for Q2 2015 financial and operational highlights which outlines Q2 results, as well as Q3 and full-year 2015 guidance, including P&L line item guidance. So, with that, I'll turn it back to Susie who will moderate the Q&A. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Dan. Katy, Let's open it up to questions for the next 25 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Katy, please go ahead. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein at JPMorgan. Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Good morning. Can you hear me okay? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hear you well. Good morning. Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Perfect. Thanks, guys. So, two items and I'll start maybe with Structural Heart. So, you had talked at the Analyst Meeting about LOTUS market share trending north of 10% in Europe. Could you just spend a minute on that? I think there was some back and forth at the meeting, just trying to get a sense where LOTUS is at this point. Is there anything more you can give us there? And then are there any metrics you can share on the WATCHMAN launch at this point in the U.S.? And how should we think about the dependence upon reimbursement either the NCD or the add-on payment in order to drive growth in 2016 and beyond? Thanks. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Thanks for the question. Good morning. Overall, as we mentioned in the script there, we're very pleased with the performance of Structural Heart overall. We took the guidance up to the high end of the range of $75 million to $100 million, which includes as you indicated, WATCHMAN and LOTUS. And I do think having the combination of LOTUS and WATCHMAN does uniquely position us in a competitive Structural Heart field, particularly given the lead that we have in the U.S. with the WATCHMAN platform globally. So starting with WATCHMAN, your first question, the great news is we're on track and actually slightly ahead of schedule in terms of our year-end goal of driving 100 large account openings in the U.S. So, we're actually ahead of pace there, which is very encouraging. We indicated during the script we're very pleased with the clinical results that we're receiving and a lot of that's due to the very measured and we believe thorough training program that we've put in place. The implants to-date are being split pretty equally across interventional cardiologist and electrophysiologist which supports our commercial model. And in terms of the reimbursement, nothing really new to report there. We're going to learn a lot more in the second half of 2015, starting with the NCD. We should learn more about the NCD in November with a final decision in first quarter of 2016. That public comment period was closed in June, and we had over 80 supportive comments and very nice support from HRS, APC and SKY (33:59). So, really happy about our launch of WATCHMAN. Turning to LOTUS, we continue to be on track with the pipeline that we laid out at the Investor Day meeting in terms of the additional valve sizes and the 14 French catheter as well. And in terms of the share, kind of similar to the feedback that we had at Investor Day. We have about a 90% reorder rate with our existing customers in TAVR which is great given the number of competitors in Europe. Once customers use LOTUS, 90% of the time they continue to reorder consistently. And we have about what we estimate a third of the market share in the accounts that we're currently penetrated in Europe. So, we'll continue to expand new accounts as we continue to expand our training programs, and we make very good progress, we believe, in the second quarter. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Keith, do you want to add anything? Keith D. Dawkins - Global Chief Medical Officer & Executive VP : Just to say, Mike, that on the clinical side the Berlin valve meeting in September we'll have the important data sets including the 250-patient REPRISE II extension one year data and the first 500 patients, that's half the patients of the RESPOND post-market study. And then more important (35:19) data coming out of (35:21) in October. Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, Keith. So, Mike, what's the appetite as well as the balance sheet bandwidth for additional M&A post the AMS acquisition? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we're always \u2013 as you know, we've always been, we think pretty smart with our acquisitions. So over the last few years with the Bayer acquisition, EP, Alliant (35:46), and now the AMS, that we've moved into faster markets. In terms of capacity, we saw, as Dan indicated in his script, we have capacity for tuck-in M&A, which is what we've historically done since I've been here. And so I think you'll see us continuing to be active in the tuck-in M&A area, so long as it hits our strategic fit and financial guidelines that we lay out. Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, Michael. I'll let some others jump in. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead. Rick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Turning to the U.S. CRM businesses, you both said I think you expected some additional headwinds from a product, competitive point of view. I'm just curious, was it better \u2013 it was a little worse than I expected, the pressure was a little greater, was it better or worse than you expected? And just as part of that, obviously, you're doing great in Europe with the mid-single-digit growth with the full sort of next wave portfolio. Is that the way we should think about the kind of growth we could see in the United States once you have that in 2016 and beyond? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The answer to your question is yes. That's really why we articulated that. We grew over 5% in Europe with that new cadence of product. And it's been a consistent, I believe, five quarters in a row of performance like that despite the tough comps in Europe. So, we have a very strong portfolio, and that's the portfolio that we'll be launching essentially in 2016 in the U.S. and then later in Japan. So, overall, it's kind of \u2013 the U.S. has some pressure. We called it last quarter. We'll continue to see some softness there. So, we anticipate kind of maybe flattish growth in the second half overall CRM. But we really build a lot of momentum going into 2016 with that portfolio and the launch of EMBLEM in the U.S. in the back half as well. So, I think the other good news is for CRM overall, if you look at the trailing 12-months, we're up 2% to 3%. And so I think if you look at longer-term perspective, we're up two to three points. And given the strength in Europe and as we position the portfolio in the U.S. for 2016, we're positive about, very enthusiastic about driving above-market growth over that time period. Rick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And just turning to operating margins, just \u2013 Dan, if I'm reading it right, obviously, you had terrific year-over-year expansion. It looked great. It was \u2013 on a sequential basis, everything stepped down a little bit from the first quarter. Is that currency? Is that something about the OpEx that we should be sensitive to? Obviously, you're reiterating your confidence about the year and the second half. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, Rick. It really is more about the OpEx, and we had talked about that on the Q1 call. But Q2 is historically and should prove again this year to be the highest OpEx quarter of the year, primarily driven by the significant amount of tradeshow activity in all the divisions. Think PCR and DDW and AUA and all the different \u2013 HRS, all happen in the second quarter. So, that's really the key driver. And recall, our range was 21% to 22%, so we called that that was going to be down from Q1, and were able to deliver 22.1%. Rick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you so much. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Robert A. Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks and good morning. So just a couple of quick questions. I want to focus mine again on WATCHMAN. And first, Mike, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the demand side of the equation. I realize fully that this is a controlled rollout, you need to be careful about training, but in the centers where you are rolled out, what are you seeing from the demand side, either for physicians and patients, anything that's kind of surprised you in the early going and again, particularly interested in terms of just demand for the product in the centers that you're launched. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So we have Dr. Stein here. I thought maybe he'd provide some commentary on your question then I can add on to it. Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President & Chief Medical Officer-Cardiac Rhythm Management : Yeah, Bob. I mean, we've been really gratified at the demand where we've launched it. I mean, really, we've been really carefully controlling the number of sites as we bring them on. As Mike mentioned in his script, we're actually bringing them on a bit faster than we had thought we would when we spoke at the Investors Day. But that really is what's throttling use of the device at this point. We have folks really asking us, joining all of our training programs. And it's early to say who are the patients who are getting it but what we've seen to-date, both in terms of patient selection and in terms of patient outcome is really right in line with what we expected to see based on our prior clinical trials. Robert A. Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And then the other thing I wanted to ask about as it relates to WATCHMAN is just a little bit more specific on the reimbursement side, relating to the add-on payment. I was wondering if you could set some expectations for us. How confident are you that you will get that add-on payment? And if you don't get it, does that change the way you think about the rollout of the product and the demand for the product in 2016? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think we really won't to provide any additional comments on the \u2013 on our \u2013 kind of giving a percentage on that. We're very confident in the data of WATCHMAN as Dr. Stein has articulated. We're very pleased with the clinical outcomes that we're seeing in the launch. And so we think the submission has unprecedented clinical data for it, but we won't provide any further comments in terms of putting odds against it. And hopefully at the end of the 3Q earnings call, we'll have better visibility to it. Robert A. Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : But I mean if you don't get it, does that matter to demand. So, we'll move away from how confident are you that you will get it, but if you don't, does that have a big impact, you think, on the rollout of the product? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think, we're having a lot of success right now. So, we'll open 100 centers this year and so, there is a strong demand for it. It delivers an unmet patient need for patients who suffer from atrial fibrillation or at risk for stroke. Ken, if you have any additional thoughts on it? Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President & Chief Medical Officer-Cardiac Rhythm Management : Just the only other thing that I just want to draw attention to is in addition to the NTAP, CMS has also proposed reassigning into a new higher class DRG... Robert A. Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Right. Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President & Chief Medical Officer-Cardiac Rhythm Management : ...as opposed to the DRG 251, they proposed reassignment to 273, 274 which would represent a 20% increase \u2013 anticipate reimbursement to hospitals. And we'd expect running about that roughly in the same timeframe as the NTAP. Robert A. Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Just two quick questions. I guess first, Mike, I'm thinking about SYNERGY and that number you gave us of 30% mix ex-U.S. and that obviously suggests to a lot of us that conversion has been a lot tougher for SYNERGY and there's obviously been more sensitivity to price and value. So, I guess two questions off of that. I guess how would you expect U.S. mix to track relative to the ex-U.S. experience? And then, just given your comments on FAST, I guess the question I have is, is FAST worth it? I mean, can you actually demonstrate better outcomes with FAST than SYNERGY? Is that investment for shareholders a good investment in your view? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Starting with SYNERGY, I think the big difference in the U.S. and Europe, really the difference in Europe as well as Japan as well, is high variance, much higher variance of pricing country-to-country. So, we have been very thoughtful about which countries we launch SYNERGY in and which countries we don't. And so, as you said, it represents 30% of our overall Europe DES revenue mix but it represents greater than 50% of our share in approximately the 10 EU countries that we're selling it into. So, where we sell it, we drive over 50% share and those accounts are paying a premium. And there's many countries that we don't sell it at all. In the U.S., there is less variance in the pricing across the hospital system. So, as a result of that, we do expect the share to be quite significant in terms of the mix of SYNERGY. So, we do believe it deserves a premium but it will be a premium that won't inhibit its adoption. So, we do believe this will be a share taker and will represent a significant percentage of the mix in the U.S. once we launch it. On fully resorbable, we're committed to innovation. And we're only going to bring this to the market in Europe and in the U.S. if it delivers unmet clinical needs. So, we don't believe the existing generation products are able to deliver in a workhorse environment, and we're only going to drive the investment in FRS through the CE Mark and/or the FDA if we're confident that it delivers on the commitments and promise that we'd want it to. Because we believe with SYNERGY, we have a best-in-class differentiated platform with a very large lead in the U.S. And so, we're not going to \u2013 we're going to really maximize that and we're going to be really smart about our FRS commitments. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's very helpful, Mike. And then, Dan, just on CRM margins (45:47) obviously they've been flat or stable the last three quarters. I know you mentioned EMBLEM will give you a boost here in the back half of 2015. So, you pick up 200 basis points on EMBLEM, that kind of gets you to 16%, 17% depending how you cut the math. How do you get the next 200 to 300 basis points over the next 18 or so months? Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I think one thing that you see first of all from the first half of this year is that EP is growing, and that's been a big part \u2013 I mean, CRM gets a lot of the focus, but think Rhythm Management, that also includes EP. And EP grew 6%, grew 9%, so that's a piece of it. And then the other part, and I think you correctly call it out, is we have significant gross margin enhancing products coming out on the CRM front. So, if you think EMBLEM, you think ACCOLADE and you think our Quad system in the first half of next year in the U.S., those are all accretive to CRM gross margin. So, the benefits of that are all seen in the overall Rhythm Management. And the last piece I would say is as we talked about our plant network optimization, the work on the most recent one, which is the benefit of moving a lot of the Electrophysiology products from Northern California to our plant in Costa Rica, the work on that finishes at the end of this year and we'll start to accrue the benefits of that in 2016 and beyond. So, all those in addition to the many other specific programs in SG&A and R&D to drive efficiencies, has us confident that we'll hit that north of 20% number by 2017. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Just on SYNERGY and FAST, Keith, do you want to comment anything? Keith D. Dawkins - Global Chief Medical Officer & Executive VP : Sure. Yeah, David. Just a couple of things. So in relation to the mix of SYNERGY in Europe, of course, we don't have reimbursements in France yet, which we're anticipating in Q4 and France is the largest DES market in Europe, so that will make a significant difference. And then with regard to FAST, I think we all agree that the currently available commercial FRS product is not a workhorse product with sub mid-single digit (47:56) market share four years after CE Mark. So we think and we're confident that we can improve on the acute performance of FRS with our differentiated FAST technology. And that's the purpose of this first human use study to study the acute performance of our FAST products and we'll give more details of that at TCG (48:20) this year. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Joshua T. Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking the questions. I was just hoping for an update on the subcutaneous ICD platform, if there's anything new to report on the reimbursement front, any color on the European rollout. I know it's been still very early. And then any details on the launch plan in the U.S.? And then just lastly if you're continuing to see sequential sales growth for the subcutaneous ICD and whether there may have been any disruption this quarter in the U.S. with the EMBLEM planned launch in Q3? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Thank you for the question. On reimbursement, the majority of the U.S. population's currently covered with the S-ICD. We estimate we're covering about 200 million lives today, including Medicare beneficiaries, about two-thirds of the Medicaid population and about 40% of the private pay market. And we continue to work on the private pay market, and we continue to make progress there. So, overall, in reimbursement, it's really not much of a headwind, and we continue to make good progress on the private side. EMBLEM really is off to a very strong start in Europe. We're not going to break out the EMBLEM sales in Europe, but we received very strong momentum off of that new launch. Physicians are very attracted to the 20% thinner design and longer battery life and also the ability to track patients remotely with the patient monitoring. In the U.S., you're really going to see a launch that'll take place more in the back half of Q3. And so, we're transitioning to that product in the U.S., and you'll see more of an impact in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. But the product itself, as you know, it offers unique features, it also offers much stronger gross margins that are accretive to the company. And we're excited about the future of it. So, Ken, if you had any other thoughts on EMBLEM at all? Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President & Chief Medical Officer-Cardiac Rhythm Management : Yeah. I mean, I think the only thing to add, again, very early, but we've been pleased with the demand that we're seeing from docs in the U.S. who want to get access to the device as we launch it again, driven by what Mike said. It's substantially thinner. It's got a 40% longer battery. It's remote monitoring capable. And so, folks are interested in it. And then, also just to highlight that we're going to continue to develop clinical data supporting the use of the S-ICD really as a first-choice device for the broad category of patients getting ICDs for primary prevention. Really pleased by the pool of data that was just published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology and recently announced our first patient enrollment in our UNTOUCHED clinical trial, which is really designed to show that outcomes with the S-ICD in the primary prevention population are at least as good as they are with transvenous devices. Joshua T. Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for that. And just one quick follow-up, a product-specific question or more on the Bayer acquisition and your Jetstream product on the atherectomy side. There's a MEDCAC Meeting yesterday that convened to dive into the Peripheral Intervention space and there had been some speculation that atherectomy reimbursement could be called into question. It seemed benign. But can you just give us an idea on how the Jetstream product is doing relative to internal expectations and maybe any commentary on your outlook for the sustainability of atherectomy reimbursement that's so strong. Thanks a lot. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. In the script, we discussed the \u2013 really the Bayer integration is going very well. We won't break out the thrombectomy and atherectomy sales separately given the size of the PI business. But that business, the legacy Bayer business grew double digits, much faster than they had prior to joining BSC, given the synergies that we have with our commercial and core portfolios. So, we're very pleased with it. We continue to see strong demand for the Jetstream product, as well as our below the knee product \u2013 blanked the name \u2013 Rota (52:35). Sorry. So, I'll turn to the MEDCAC Panel, I think, we welcome that type of dialogue. It reinforces a lot of the clinical research and trials that we've invested for many years in our Peripheral business. And we continue to be confident in the clinical evidence that the PI business generates. And as you indicated in your comments, we don't anticipate a significant change based on that panel. Joshua T. Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks again. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brooks West with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Mike, just following up on the last question, specifically on Lutonix. Can you guys give us a little bit better idea of the scale and opportunity for the U.S. drug-coated balloon partnership? And then just a little bit more detail on kind of how that product was received when you all launched it in Q2? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, the alliance we have with Bard really works for both companies, given their investment in Lutonix balloon and our capabilities in atherectomy, thrombectomy and some of the complex PI procedures. So, the alliance is going well. It's very early. So, we're not going to break out separate sales or give kind of hospital account information given the competitiveness of that field. But I would say the early innings of it are very positive. The companies are working well together. They have excellent registry data that they've presented. And we have a very strong commercial team with a very wide portfolio to help them to leverage that. So, we're bullish about the alliance, but we're going to steer away from providing specific sales breakouts or account information. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Do you see that though, Mike, as something that could be a $100 million product for Boston at some point? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. You'd have to ask Tim Ring and the Bard team that. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): All right. And then one for Ken. Just on the growth trends in Electrophysiology. Can you \u2013 just a little bit more on what's driving that. Is that catheters? Is it the diagnostic piece you got from Bard? How is the rollout of the Rhythmia system going? Just any kind of detail on trends you could give us there would be very helpful. Thanks. Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President & Chief Medical Officer-Cardiac Rhythm Management : Yeah. I'm not going to break it out specifically by product category, Brooks. Rhythmia, again, we are I would say well into the early phase of the launch and really very pleased with how the system's performing. It is really the first next-generation mapping system for arrhythmias \u2013 high density, high resolution. I can't tell you the number of cases that I've gone out and been with colleagues where you do the case and you finish and they say, gosh, we just never could've done this procedure successfully with any of the previous mapping systems. So, so far, everything that we've seen with it during the early launch has validated all of our thoughts when we purchased the technology. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Katy, we'll take one more, please. Operator : Okay. Our last question then comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. Two questions here. First, so, Dan, I couldn't help but mention you said early on that you've grown 6% or better the last six quarters per Mike's commentary. But the guidance assumes a bit of a deceleration. So, basically, are you saying that it's going to be difficult to grow 6% operationally in the second half of this year? And that $61 million this quarter for interest expense, is that what we should assume for Q4 in 2016 once the AMS deal closes? I did have one follow-up question on WATCHMAN. Thanks. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, Larry. So, in terms of the second half revenue, I think there's really three key things that are the headwinds on the back half of this year. The first, and we mentioned this, is the IC comps. So, when you think of Interventional Cardiology last year in the second half, that grew 8% in Q3 and 10% in Q4, so 9% overall in the second half. So, we're up against much more significant comps on the IC side. We now are looking at CRM. We talk about that being flattish for the back half of 2015. Obviously feel good about the new launches we'll have in late 2015 and early 2016, and with Mike's comments, believe we're on the right side of a share gain strategy beyond that. But the next two quarters, should be flattish in CRM. So, those two \u2013 plus when you think of the operational revenue growth rate, in the first half of this year, we've had six months of Bayer revenue contribution, and in the second half, we'll only have two months without a comparable from the year prior. So, I think those are the real headwinds. We obviously have tailwinds as well. We're excited about the launch of WATCHMAN, and we're excited about, as Dr. Stein mentioned, Rhythmia, LOTUS in Europe, things like that. But the balance of it, we think 4% to 6% is the right range. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : But Dan, the $61 million per quarter, and then for interest expense, once AMS closes? Just lastly on WATCHMAN, I think this has kind of been asked a few different ways on the call, but how common are the local non-coverage decisions in place for \u2013 that have been put in place for Lariat and how much do you think that's impacting the early uptake? And that's it for me, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. I'll take the interest one quickly and then turn it over for the second one. I'd say the net of the new debt at the favorable rates offset by the fact that we have incremental debt for the AMS acquisition probably puts us in a $10 million to $20 million a year increase in overall interest expense, on an annual basis. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And, Larry, just on WATCHMAN, not a whole lot new there. Just to reinforce, the vast clinical data that we have with WATCHMAN. I would argue is quite a bit different than what we've seen with Lariat in the U.S. So, it's difficult to even put those platforms in the same bucket. And so, the good news is we've enrolled our first 50 centers faster than planned and we'll likely enroll our second set of 50 centers, the goal of 100 centers faster than plan and we're delivering very good outcomes. And we're receiving strong uptake from it and we'll get more on the reimbursement pathway as we mentioned with the NCD in November and the NTAP as well. So, we like the momentum that we have and as Dr. Stein said, we'll continue to layer on more and more clinical evidence on top of WATCHMAN to further differentiate it. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for that. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. Thanks, Mike. And with that, we'd like to conclude the call. Thanks for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific. Before you disconnect, Katy will give you all the pertinent details for the replay. Thank you.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will connect a question and answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Susie Lisa, please go ahead. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q3 2015 results which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the investor relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights of Q3 2015, Dan will review the financials for the quarter and then Q4 2015 and full-year 2015 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers Dr. Keith Dawkins and Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin I'd like to remind everyone that on the call organic revenue growth is defined as excluding the impact of sales from divested businesses, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from the acquisitions of interventional businesses of Bayer AG, Bayer and the American Medical Systems AMS Male Urology portfolio over the prior year period. Also note this call contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance including sales, margins, earnings and other Q4 and full-year 2015 and 2016 guidance, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend, and other expenses. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause these differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Q and 8-Ks filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well done, Susie. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, Boston Scientific posted another quarter of strong results, as we continue to execute against our near-term goals and longer-term plans that were detailed at our May Investor Day meeting. We outlined plans to drive mid-single digit organic revenue growth and consistent adjusted operating margin expansion, which in turn will drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We delivered against these plans in third quarter with worldwide organic revenue growth of 5% and operational revenue growth of 9%, including the impact from the Bayer and AMS acquisitions. We also continue to make progress on our efforts to improve our adjusted operating margin profile and during the quarter, we delivered a 260 basis point year-over-year improvement to 23.1%. This solid revenue growth and differentiated margin expansion drove very strong 18% adjusted EPS growth. This quarter's results reflect the high performance of our global teams, the continued diversification of our portfolio into higher-growth end markets, and the balanced growth across our businesses. Looking forward, we remain committed to achieving double digit adjusted EPS growth, and are updating our full-year 2015 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $0.90 to $0.92. This updated EPS guidance brings up the lower end of the range of our initial guidance in February of $0.88 to $0.92, and that's despite an estimated $0.08 foreign currency impact for the full year. We're also raising our full-year 2015 organic revenue growth estimate from 3% to 5%, to now 4% to 5%. Now a few key highlights for the quarter. In my remarks, all references to growth are on an organic year-over-year constant-currency basis, unless otherwise specified. We delivered broad-based global organic revenue growth of 5% despite a challenging 5% comparable in Q3 2014. We're pleased to see all seven of our businesses deliver year-over-year sales growth either on par or ahead of Q2 growth rates, led by compelling new product launches, increased traction from our Structural Heart business, continued international expansion, and synergies from our acquisitions. Momentum continues to build in our MedSurg segment and for the second consecutive quarter, each business accelerated year-over-year revenue growth. Endoscopy's year-over-year growth rate improved from 4% in Q1 to 6% in Q2 and now 7% in Q3, and this growth was fueled by our new SpyGlass DS launch. SpyGlass is an exciting new platform that is used to diagnose and treat complex disorders of the pancreas and bile ducts. SpyGlass is also an enabler that helps pull through the core Endo portfolio. In Endo, we've also seen strong reception for our AXIOS endoscopic ultrasound technology, and we continue to drive strong double-digit growth in the emerging markets. In Neuromodulation, revenue accelerated in Q3, growing 11% after being up 9% in Q2 and 6% in Q1. We delivered strong growth in all regions for Neuromod, with the U.S. up 8%, Europe growing double digits and additionally, EMEA grew at 9%, fueled by emerging markets. This growth was led by continued adoption of our market-leading Precision Spectra spinal cord stimulation platform, which helps provide relief from debilitating pain. In Europe, we're off to a solid start with Precision Novi, our first product for the primary cell non-rechargeable SCS space. Moving to Deep Brain Stimulation, we began the launch of Vercise, our new primary cell platform in Europe. In addition, we are advancing our strategic alliance in neuronavigation with Brainlab, all in an effort to help improve the quality of life for patients suffering from Parkinson's, dystonia, and essential tremor. Neurology and public health also improved its top line performance, growing 9% in Q3 after 7% in Q2 and 3% in Q1. The acceleration in the quarter was driven by our comprehensive portfolio, particularly guide wires and laser fibers. We also benefited from our ongoing international expansion efforts, with sales up 7% in the U.S. and 11% internationally. After closing the AMS Male Urology portfolio acquisition on August 3, we have stepped up the important work of quality remediation at our AMS Minnetonka plant to progress towards lifting of the FDA warning letter. Also, the sales force integration is progressing as planned, and we're excited about expanding the industry's largest commercial team. Importantly, we remain on track to realize our adjusted EPS accretion goals of at least $0.03 in 2016 and $0.07 in 2017. Our Cardiovascular group grew 6% in Q3, with Interventional Cardiology outpacing our market growth estimates with another 6% increase in year-over-year sales. Most of our IC franchises grew mid-single digits or significantly better, and the U.S., Europe, and EMEA were all up mid to high single digits. Importantly, we recently earned U.S. approval of our SYNERGY bioabsorbable polymer drug-eluting stents. We are thrilled about the ongoing U.S. launch of SYNERGY, a premium and differentiated workhorse stent that is designed from the ground up to promote healing. We look forward to building upon our strong clinical evidence with the start of the EVOLVE short DAPT study in first quarter 2016, and we remain on track for a Japan launch of SYNERGY in first half 2016. In Europe, SYNERGY continues to grow, and now represents more than 30% of our European DES revenue mix, and over 50% of our mix in our top ten markets. Our PCI guidance business continues to deliver, with mid-teen growth in the quarter. We recently began the U.S. and European limited market release of our integrated FFR imaging system. Revenue from our broad-based portfolio of accessory products for complex PCI also grew high single digits in the quarter. Finally, the IC performance was fueled by our strength in the Structural Heart business, which includes our Lotus percutaneous aortic valve and WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure device. We believe that we are uniquely positioned for the long term to assist hospitals and physicians with the growing Structural Heart demands due to the unique capabilities of the Lotus and WATCHMAN platforms. Lotus continues to penetrate the European market and we are executing on the pipeline that we detailed at Investor Day. Our clinical evidence continues to build with its best-in-class paravalvular leakage rates, and we remain on track to complete enrollment in both our REPRISE III IDE and RESPOND post-approval European study by year-end 2015. Finally, we're really pleased with our differentiated Lotus Valve including its innovative adaptive seal and the ability to uniquely fully recapture and reposition the valve. The adaptive seal is a crucial contributor to Lotus best-in-valve PVL rates and we have successfully built an extensive patent portfolio to protect that innovation. Also in the Structural Heart, the U.S. WATCHMAN launch continues to progress well. We are pleased with implant success rates and the high quality of patient outcomes thus far, which reflect our controlled rollout and proven training program. Multiple WATCHMAN presentations at TCT by key opinion leaders demonstrated continued clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness. Dr. Vivek Reddy of Mount Sinai, New York, presented an analysis at TCT of the PROTECT AF and PREVAIL clinical trials that showed a 59% relative risk reduction in disabling strokes. Dr. Reddy also highlighted an economic analysis comparing WATCHMAN with both warfarin and novel oral anti-coagulants, which we hope will be published soon in a major cardiology journal. WATCHMAN provides protection against stroke while avoiding the long-term bleeding and complications of anti-coagulant drugs and their attendant cost. As a result, we expect that the analysis will show that compared to both warfarin and the novel oral anti-coagulants, WATCHMAN can save the healthcare system money in the long run while also providing outstanding results for patients. So overall, we're very excited about our progress in Structural Heart. We continue to expect to deliver full year 2015 Structural Heart revenue at the high end of our $75 million to $100 million goal that we provided at our May Investor Day. Moving to Peripheral Interventions, we have a number of good things happening here. The core PI business continues to execute and we are very pleased with the integration of the legacy Bayer business. After growing double digits in Q2, Bayer Peripheral accelerated and grew 20% in Q3 as we continued to grow share in the atherectomy market. We're also pleased with our commercial relationship with C. R. Bard in the Lutonix Drug Coated Balloon technology. The combination of Lutonix DCB, two SR platforms (10:58) and the broadest portfolio in PI is helping drive 5% organic growth in our legacy PI business. In PI, we're also encouraged by early feedback on the U.S. launch of our Innova Bare-Metal stent for the SFA and the global launch of our Zelante deep vein thrombosis catheter. Finally, the MAJESTIC 12 month data was recently announced at CIRSE [Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe] for the ELUVIA DES platform which showed a 96.1% patency rate at 12 months. Excitement is building for the CE Mark for ELUVIA and launch in first quarter 2016 and we expect enrollment for the ID trial to begin this quarter. Now I'll provide a few comments on CRM. On our first quarter earnings call, we predicted a slowdown in the worldwide CRM sales for the balance of 2015 due primarily to replacement cycle headwinds and competitive launches in the U.S. We have seen that trend develop with global CRM sales flat for the quarter and we continue to anticipate some softness in U.S. CRM sales through first quarter 2016 as we await the launch of key new products in the U.S. such as the launch of our Brady MRI safe system in first quarter 2016 and full X4 Quad system in first half 2016. Pacemaker sales did grow 2%, led by share gains for our recently launch X4 CRT-D Quad device and while ICD sales declined 1% we continue to be pleased with our de novo (12:16) ICD performance driven by ENDURALIFE battery technology and our second generation S-ICD EMBLEM. However, the EMBLEM S-ICD gains are being offset in the near-term by replacement cycle headwinds. It's important to highlight that our European CRM business delivered low to mid-single digit for the sixth consecutive quarter. In Europe, we estimate we're taking share with a differentiated portfolio including full X4 CRT-D and CRT-P Quad systems, 3T MRI safe pacemakers, EMBLEM S-ICD and our industry-leading ENDURALIFE battery technologies. These consistent European CRM results are encouraging as we look forward to our anticipated key product approvals in the U.S. in 2016. In EP, we continue to build momentum with 13% growth in Q3. This encouraging sequential growth is being driven by Rhythmia, our differentiated high density, high resolution mapping and navigation system as well as a solid quarter in our recording devices. We also look forward to the upcoming launch of our IntellaMap Open-Irrigated Ablation catheter in Europe. In terms of our regional performance in Q3, the U.S. grew organic revenue, up 4%, while Europe and Asia posted 7% growth. Emerging market sales improved to 13% growth, up 12% from Q2, led by mid-20% revenue growth in India and mid-teens revenue growth in China. So stepping back, our 5% organic revenue growth reflects the strong diversification of our portfolio, our focus on meaningful innovation and our ongoing globalization efforts. Importantly, we believe that we're well positioned to continue our performance track record, and I would like to thank our employees for their winning spirit and their commitment to Boston Scientific. Now let me turn the call over to Dan for a more detailed review of our financials. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Mike. I'll start with some overall perspective on the quarter before getting into the details. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.24 in the quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.21 to $0.23 and representing 18% year-over-year growth. Excluding the $0.03 unfavorable foreign exchange impact, Q3 adjusted earnings per share grew 31% year-over-year. The strong performance in Q3 was driven primarily by operational revenue growth and gross margin expansion. Our Q3 2015 adjusted operating margin of 23.1% exceeded the high end of our guidance range and represents improvement of 260 basis points over Q3 of last year. In each of the first three quarters of the year, total company adjusted operating margin expanded by at least 200 basis points over the prior year quarter and despite significant FX headwinds, the high end of our $0.90 to $0.92 adjusted EPS range for full year 2015 still represents double digit adjusted EPS growth. Now for the P&L highlights. For the third quarter of 2015, consolidated revenue of $1.888 billion represented operational revenue growth of 9%, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the divested Neurovascular business. Excluding an approximate 110 basis point contribution from the Bayer Interventional acquisition and 310 basis point contribution from the AMS Male Urology portfolio acquisition, organic revenue growth was 5% in the quarter. On an as-reported basis, revenue grew 2% year-over-year. The foreign exchange impact on sales was a $135 million headwind compared to the prior year period, which was about $10 million worse than we had assumed in our Q3 guidance range. Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 72.5%, achieving the high end of guidance and increasing 140 basis points year-over-year. Cost improvements, driven by our value improvement programs and our FX hedging program, positively impacted adjusted gross margin by 150 basis points and 30 basis points, respectively. This was partially offset by 40 basis points of negative price and mix. Q3 adjusted gross margin was also helped by favorable manufacturing variances, driven by the earlier-than-expected launch of SYNERGY in the United States. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $697 million, or 36.9% of sales in Q3 2015. Our Q3 2015 adjusted SG&A rate was down 110 basis points from Q3 of last year, and we continue to believe our full-year 2015 adjusted SG&A rate will be approximately 37%. Adjusted research and development expenses were $220 million in the third quarter or 11.7% of sales. This adjusted R&D rate is up 80 basis points sequentially, consistent with our guidance which signaled a higher rate of R&D spend in the second half of 2015 versus the first half. For Q4, we expect a slight uptick sequentially in our adjusted R&D rate, particularly related to clinical trial activity, with a guidance midpoint of 12%. For the full year 2015, we still believe our adjusted R&D rate will be approximately 11.5%. Royalty expense was $17 million in the quarter which was just below 1% of sales. On an adjusted basis operating income was $436 million in the quarter or 23.1% of sales, up 260 basis points year-over-year and 100 basis points sequentially. Adjusted operating income growth was balanced with all three reportable segments posting more than 20% year-over-year growth. All three segments also grew adjusted operating margin sequentially, with Rhythm Management and MedSurg improving more than 300 basis points each. Rhythm Management's adjusted operating margin in Q3 was 17.8%, which is up 370 basis points both year-over-year and sequentially. From a gross margin perspective, Rhythm Management benefited from the favorable gross margin profiles of new technologies such as the EMBLEM S-ICD and the ACCOLADE family of pacemakers. Rhythm Management's Q3 gross margin was also helped by favorable manufacturing variances which we do not expect to recur in Q4. Importantly, however, we expect second-half Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to average 17%, consistent with the guidance given on our Q2 call, and even with an expected sequential downtick in Q4, second half 2015 Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin is expected to increase by more than 200 basis points over the first half of 2015, reflecting the strong gains we're making in this area. We remain confident in the 20%-plus adjusted operating margin for Rhythm Management in 2017 and expect a fairly linear annual progression in terms of that improvement. To conclude on Q3 adjusted operating margin, it's important to note that while we are very pleased with our rate of 23.1% in the quarter, we believe that roughly 50 basis points of benefit can be attributed to the aforementioned favorable manufacturing variances related to SYNERGY and reserves and variances in Rhythm Management. Excluding this favorability Q3 adjusted operating margin would have landed closer to our guidance midpoint of 22.5%. GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items of $735 million was a loss of $299 million in Q3 2015. The primary GAAP to adjusted items for the quarter included restructuring related charges of $21 million; acquisition-related SG&A expenses of $23 million; pension plan termination charges of $36 million; contingent consideration expense of $40 million; amortization expense of $131 million; and litigation-related charges of $457 million. Let me provide a little more detail on the litigation charge in the quarter. The $457 million in litigation-related net charges were related to increases in our transvaginal surgical mesh product liability reserves. Every quarter, we assess all four components included in calculating the reserve and make any necessary adjustments for all probable and estimable charges : one, the volume of known claims; two, the estimated cost to resolve each claim; three, an estimate of future claims; and four, the cost to defend each claim. The vast majority of the increase in the reserve was driven by the first three items, although all four contributed to the increase in the reserve. Although the pace of newly filed claims has slowed over time, our known claim count is now in excess of 30,000 and we now have reached conditional settlement agreements with certain plaintiffs' counsel throughout 2015 to resolve over 6,000 cases and claims. Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $1.559 billion as of September 30, 2015, and we believe it reflects our best estimate of what is probable and estimable. With respect to other income and expense, interest expense for the quarter was $58 million, compared to $54 million in Q3 of last year. The increase was primarily due to the incremental debt raised in Q2 of this year to finance the AMS Male Urology portfolio acquisition. Our average interest rate was 3.9% in Q3 2015, compared to 4.7% in Q3 of last year. The lower interest expense rate in Q3 of this year was primarily due to lower average cost of debt resulting from the senior notes refinancing completed in Q2 of 2015. Other expense was $10 million, and this consisted primarily of foreign exchange losses incurred during the quarter. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 45.9% on an as-reported basis and 11.5% on an adjusted basis. Our Q3 adjusted tax rate includes $4.5 million of favorable discrete tax items, and we now expect our full year 2015 adjusted tax rate to be 13%. Finally, as mentioned, Q3 2015 adjusted EPS of $0.24 includes approximately $0.03 of unfavorable FX and represents 18% year-over-year growth, or 31% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, Q3 2015 earnings per share was a loss of $0.15 and includes net charges and amortization expenses totaling $524 million after tax. A loss of $0.15 compares to earnings per share of $0.03 on a GAAP basis in the prior-year period. Moving on to the balance sheet, DSO of 62 days increased one day compared to September of last year, and days inventory on hand of 186 days was up 21 days compared to September of last year, due primarily to the acquisition of the AMS Male Urology portfolio. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $394 million, compared to $330 million in Q3 of last year. This increase was primarily due to higher adjusted operating profit and a continued focus on working capital management. We continue to expect our full year 2015 adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $1.3 billion. Capital expenditures were $69 million in the quarter, compared to $57 million in Q3 of last year, and we still expect CapEx to be roughly $260 million for the full year 2015, and expect Q4 to be our highest CapEx quarter, due to the timing of projects. There were no share repurchases in the quarter, consistent with our decision to temporarily suspend the share repurchase program following the announcement of the agreement to acquire AMS's Male Urology portfolio. Near term, our capital allocation priorities are debt repayment, maintaining flexibility, and tuck-in M&A and our M&A strategy prioritizes targets that are a strong strategic fit with compelling financial returns. We ended Q3 2015 with 1.364 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our share count to increase by roughly 5 million per quarter through the end of 2016, as we plan to keep the buyback suspended for some or all of 2016, as we had previously announced. I'd like to conclude with guidance for Q4 and the full year 2015, which now includes the recently acquired AMS Male Urology portfolio. For Q4 2015, we expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $1.970 billion to $2.010 billion. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, we expect the estimated headwind from FX should be approximately $80 million to $90 million, or 410 to 460 basis points, relative to Q4 of last year. On an operational basis, we expect consolidated Q4 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of 9% to 10% and on an organic basis, we expect Q4 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of 4% to 5%. We expect adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter to be in the range of 72.5%, plus or minus 25 basis points, and an adjusted operating margin of approximately 22.75%, also plus or minus 25 basis points. Finally, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.23 to $0.25 per share, and reported GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.10 to $0.13 per share. For the full year 2015, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $7.470 billion to $7.510 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 8% operationally, and a range of 4% to 5% organically. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, we expect the FX headwind to be roughly $475 million to $485 million for the full year 2015. We continue to expect our full year 2015 adjusted operating margin to be approximately 22.5%, and this would represent an improvement of roughly 230 basis points over the full year 2014. Finally, we're raising the low end of our full year adjusted EPS guidance range, and now expect a range of $0.90 to $0.92. We expect the unfavorable FX impact on full year 2015 adjusted EPS to be approximately $0.08, up from the initial guidance of $0.04 issued in February. So despite an incremental $0.04 of unfavorable FX, we've not only held our guidance throughout 2015, but are now raising the midpoint from $0.90 to $0.91. The high end of our adjusted EPS guidance range represents double-digit growth, and based on current rates, 18% growth at the midpoint when you exclude the impact of foreign exchange. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.02 to $0.05. Before I conclude, I'd like to give some visibility on the expected impact of foreign exchange in 2016. If foreign exchange rates hold constant, we expect there to be approximately $0.05 of unfavorable FX impact on 2016 adjusted EPS. As we've done so far this year, we will make every effort to offset this impact and deliver on our adjusted EPS growth targets. We'll issue the remainder of our 2016 guidance on our Q4 earnings call in 2016. I encourage you to check our Investor Relations website for Q3 2015 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q3 results as well as Q4 and full year 2015 guidance, including P&L line-item guidance. So with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Dan. Brad, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one quick related follow-up. Brad, please go ahead. Operator : Thank you. And our first question will come from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thank you. Can you hear me okay? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We can hear you. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We can hear you fine, Bob. Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Good morning and congratulations on a really strong third quarter. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Bob. Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, I have two questions, one regarding the fourth quarter guidance on the revenue side, and the other just on 2016 and your comments about FX. So to start with the Q4 guide, you grew a really solid 5% in the third quarter. The fourth quarter guidance of 4% to 5% organic is slightly lower than the third quarter growth despite SYNERGY and a lot of good momentum in the business. So I'm just curious, in Q4 versus Q3, what deteriorates in terms of growth or is this just simply conservatism built into the guide? Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, let me give you a sense of that, Bob. So I think as you said, we're guiding 4% to 5% organically for the fourth quarter. Certainly, very pleased with the organic growth performance year-to-date, which is about 4.7% and expect organic growth of 4% to 5% both in Q4 and for the full year, which is a raise from our previous guidance of 3% to 5%. And a quick tailwind and headwind summary, I think you're right. SYNERGY, obviously, is the largest tailwind in Q4. It does have, obviously, a slower ramp than traditional DES launches, as there's a contracting element to it and it's a premium product. And it does face pretty tough comp year-over-year when you think back to last year, DES grew 12% globally for the company. So it's a tough comp for SYNERGY. And then \u2013 but continued launch and roll out of WATCHMAN as well \u2013 is another tailwind. On the headwinds side, and I think Mike covered this in his prepared remarks, the CRM headwinds persist. Which as we indicated on our Q1 call, we do have some portfolio gaps in the U.S., primarily around MRI-safe technology and Quad. Good news is we filled those gaps in Q1 with Brady MRI in the U.S. in the first half with Quad. And then we have the replacement cycle headwinds which have been persisting, but those will wane as we go through 2016 and 2017. And then, again, we have another 5% overall organic growth comp for the company versus Q4 of last year. And then lastly, if you look at MedSurg, very pleased with MedSurg. MedSurg overall, 8% growth in the third quarter, as Mike had mentioned and very pleased with that, but those are the highest growth rates in the past 12 months for each of those businesses. So it would be hard to count on that performance every quarter at the midpoint of guidance. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll also add, we delivered a strong quarter this quarter. We expect to deliver a strong one again in fourth quarter. And we've always made the commitment, even at the low end of a range which we clearly don't aim for, we'll deliver on operating income margin improvement targets. So I think the company is focused on high performance. We believe we did it in third quarter; we're giving strong guidance again for fourth quarter and even if we deliver at the low end of the range, we're committed to the margin improvement. Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. That's very helpful. I just wanted to make sure we had a sense for the moving parts, so thank you for that answer. So I guess, I'll let others focus on 2016, but I guess to follow-up, I just want to be clear on CRM. Previously, you had said you expect in the back half CRM to be roughly flat year-over-year. And that's what you delivered in the third quarter. Is that what you roughly expect for the fourth quarter as well, implicit in this guidance, is CRM to, again, be kind of roughly flat year-over-year? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would say that's \u2013 we won't give \u2013 carve out specific guidance for CRM for fourth quarter, but I would say that trend is consistent. You know we called a softening of CRM back in first quarter. We're seeing that. The great news, we're seeing offset in Europe with consistent, I think six quarters in a row, of strong growth in Europe. And those products will be improved in the first half. So, we anticipate an ongoing softening in CRM kind of where we are today, flattish, that we delivered this quarter. And we expect that through first quarter 2016 consistent with the script. The great news is we're offsetting that flattish growth with strong growth across the enterprise. And more importantly, or as importantly, we're delivering strong growth in Europe with our CRM portfolio. And so, we're anxious for that to come to the U.S., which would further propel 2016. Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Perfect. Congrats again. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And then Bob, did you have a question on FX for 2016 as well? Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Well, I just \u2013 you guys gave some guidance there and a $0.05 headwind \u2013 and that's much appreciated. And I just wanted to kind of get your sense for other puts and takes because the Street is modeling roughly 16% earnings growth for next year. And it was just \u2013 with a $0.05 FX headwind \u2013 just wondering if you had any other comments and other considerations for 2016 relative to what you said previously. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I think I'm not going to get into a full 2016 guidance review, obviously, today, but just given the FX landscape of the year and a lot of questions we get relative to FX going into 2016, felt like it was prudent to give folks a sense of what we see relative to that in 2016. As we did this year, we were able to offset all of that. Our goal obviously is to offset as much of that as we can, but in terms of specific line item and headwind and tailwind guidance for 2016, I'll save that for the call in February. Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, David. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Mike, I wonder if you could give us some high level thoughts on 2016. As you remember, back at the Analyst Day, you talked about 100 basis points of acceleration in the LRP sort of heading into next year. And when I consider Quad, SYNERGY and WATCHMAN, is there any reason that we should not expect acceleration in 2016 relative to the numbers you're putting up here in 2015, which looks like they're going to come in pretty close to 5%? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. We really don't want to provide any ongoing guidance to 2016 till after our fourth quarter close and our call. So I would just say we give pretty specific guidance that we've delivered on for many years in a row now during our Investor Day meeting. So we called for some accelerated growth in 2016 at that Investor Day, and so we continue to execute against that plan, both in top line and margin improvement, Bob (sic) [David] (35:12) but we likely won't get into any additional guidance until later. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then Dan, maybe kind of another quick question. You gave us the currency for next year. I'm just thinking about the fourth quarter guide. You're averaging about 230 basis points of margin expansion year-to-date. Obviously, the fourth quarter revenue guidance, at least versus our model, is pretty solid. Your margin guidance for the fourth quarter's also very solid, 200 basis points of year-on-year expansion. But your earnings number, $23 million to $25 million, is a little low based on the margin and revenue performance. Is there anything non-op to call our attention to in the fourth quarter? And kind of same question for 2016, Dan, other than currency, is there any non-operational stuff we should be considering in our models for 2016? Thank you. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, I don't think anything of a material nature from a non-op perspective. I think if you look at what we drive from an operating margin perspective and the improvements there, the flow-through to EPS is \u2013 save for the FX commentary that I have \u2013 the flow-through is pretty consistent and standard. So and... David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And any case for 2016? Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : ...that's for Q4, and then for 2016, same thing. I wouldn't \u2013 again, I'm not going to get into specifics \u2013 but I wouldn't look at anything from a non-op perspective that would derail the ability for the operating margin to translate into EPS improvement. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. Operator : And our next question will come from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Chris T. Pasquale - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. This is Chris Pasquale here for Mike. Mike, the sequential acceleration in Neuro and EP over the first nine months of the year's been encouraging. Can you just go into some more detail on some of the drivers there? What are you seeing in Neuro, and where do you think you are at this point in the Rhythmia launch? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Neuro, the business grew really well in the quarter, 11%. So the business continues to do well. We're the number one share player in the rechargeable market in the U.S., and we recently launched our primary sell product in Europe and in the Asia market. So that's a category that we hadn't played in, which is a little over $250 million market outside the U.S. So we've got a leading platform in the U.S. that we continued to expand. We launched Novi to expand the addressable market for spinal cord stim. And also, another big part of our strategy in Neuromod's is expanding beyond pain. We've been investing for a number of years in our deep brain stimulation platform, and I said in my prepared comments, we have a primary sell DBS launch called Vercise that we're really excited about, because that's the primary \u2013 focus is on primary cell (37:36) rather than rechargeable for DBS. We're also unrolling our DBS trial in the U.S., which we'll provide additional guidance on in the future. So, that business continues to expand. We have very differentiated technology in the markets also; we think are consistent, strong mid-single digit growth markets. On EP, we're really pleased with the success here. We've had three quarters of sequential growth. We've put up 13% this quarter. And we continue to put the building blocks in place to have a very powerful EP business and Rhythm Management business combined with our CRM business in the future. And that's, as I mentioned before, that's really being driven by our Rhythmia, our mapping system, which gives the physicians lots of speed in terms of capture of the imaging; and also recording devices and we're launching our therapeutic catheter line in the fourth quarter in Europe and we'll extend that to the U.S. in 2016. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Ken, do you want to add any comments? Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President & Chief Medical Officer-Cardiac Rhythm Management : Just to say in terms of the Rhythmia launch itself, again, very pleased with how it's going. We've seen it used now in multiple different geographies. It's been used in all four chambers of the heart successfully, and getting very consistent feedback from physicians using it, that it's enabling them to successfully treat arrhythmias that they never ever would have been able to approach before. Chris T. Pasquale - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. And then, sorry if I missed this, but could you tell us how the DES business performed this quarter? I don't think I heard any comments there and just wanted to get a baseline ahead of the U.S. SYNERGY launch; maybe globally, and in the U.S. if you can. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. We're not breaking out the growth rate specifically for DES. Interventional Cardiology business grew 7%. Essentially, think of our DES growth in line with the market as we approach the SYNERGY launch in the fourth quarter and the Europe and the Japanese launch later in 2016. Chris T. Pasquale - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Operator : And our next question will come from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I wanted just to start with WATCHMAN and then certainly I appreciate your comments, again reiterating the Structural Heart business likely to come in at the high end of the range that you had provided back at the Investor Day in May. But maybe you could help us go into just a little bit more detail on how WATCHMAN is performing. Any sense on reorder rates and how we should just think about the ramp in that business, particularly in light of some of the data that were presented positively at TCT? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Good morning. And I'll let Ken Stein comment as well. Just on a couple of the figures, we're not providing any additional guidance on WATCHMAN in terms of our revenue update or reorder rates. We continue to, what I will comment on is the business is doing quite well. We discussed hitting the high end of the range of $75 million to $100 million, WATCHMAN being a key contributor to that. We're really well on track of our goal of opening 100 centers this year. So we'll deliver against that and then we'll open up new centers in 2016. And the team has done a really good job of managing the controlled launch and providing excellent training. Ken, any other additional comments you want to provide on WATCHMAN? Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President & Chief Medical Officer-Cardiac Rhythm Management : Yes. Thanks, Mike. David, I just want to reiterate, we're really pleased not just with the rates that we're seeing of implants in the U.S. post-commercialization, but the success and fantastic safety profile that we're seeing, which again, as Mike, I think, has said previously, that's what's (41:09) been a really rigorous approach that we're taking of training and to account selection. Again, as you said, we had some great data out at TCT; going to have a featured presentation at AHA in a few weeks on our European post-market experience, a 1,000 patient trial called EVOLUTION. And again, as Mike said, really looking forward to seeing publication of a cost effectiveness paper at some point in the near term, which we really hope is going to show that, in addition to giving great patient outcomes, that this is a device that is also very likely to save the healthcare system money over the long run. David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just on the Rhythm Management franchise, you did provide some detail around duration of replace and market headwinds, and when we should potentially see a turn there next year. But if you kind of take a step back and look at the overall Rhythm Management portfolio, it would seem like you're moving from a position of potentially playing a little bit of defense, given the replacement market dynamics, to being much more on your front foot with the X4 launch, Rhythmia ramping up the next generation line of pacemakers, EMBLEM, et cetera. Are you at a point now where you feel like that business can move into an accelerating growth mode? And to what extent do you think that's a sustainable trend, versus this is just sort of the normal horse trading of market share that occurs here? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I actually think we're playing offense in CRM rather than defense, for a couple reasons. One, we talked about six quarters of consistent growth in Europe, where they have our \u2013 really, many of our leading products \u2013 and growing quite well in Europe, despite a replacement cycle headwind in Europe. And also, in more on the offensive mind, we continue to gain share in de novo implants. So physicians are choosing Boston Scientific more often than not. A lot of that's being driven by our EMBLEM S-ICD platform, which is growing sequentially very impressively. But as you said, the headwind is more on the replacement cycle headwind, which will abate as we approach the end of 2016. So, we are positioned well for 2016 once we get out of the first quarter, which I mentioned in the prepared comments, with the anticipated product approvals. And you'll see a ramping down of this replacement cycle headwind in fourth quarter 2016 as we get into 2017. David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Two questions on SYNERGY. First, with respect to the U.S. strategy, should we assume the strategy will be similar to Europe, in the sense that you'll take a multi-tiered pricing strategy? And would the goal be to \u2013 I assume \u2013 to capture more of the U.S. market than you've done in Europe with SYNERGY? And then as a follow-on, specific to pricing, a lot of our survey work suggests that you could probably get a 10% premium, and that would be accepted by the interventional market. So maybe talk about what you guys are thinking in terms of premium pricing, and what your market intelligence is suggesting, in terms of what the market would bear with respect to a premium price? Thanks. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we do thank you for your insight on the survey. That helps. I think overall on SYNERGY we will continue to, as we said consistently, continue to have a tiered portfolio in drug-eluding stents. We had that in the European market with SYNERGY priced at a premium. In the ten markets where SYNERGY's launched in Europe, it represents over 50% of our market share. And in the U.S., we also will have that same tiered portfolio with SYNERGY; the premium end, Promus PREMIER, which is the market-leading stent in the U.S., will be at a price discount versus SYNERGY. So we won't provide the specific premium that we're going to charge. I think it is important to note that this is a premium product, but as Dan indicated in his comments, this is a product that we will need to go through a contracting process with hospitals, given our pricing strategy. So we do anticipate excellent results in 2016, but we need to also work through that contracting process with hospitals. Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Can I just add... Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Keith, do you want to add anything? Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Can I just add one quick follow-up? As you've launched this into the marketplace today and into your hospitals, what's been the overall reaction to the product, from a pricing point of view? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: From a pricing point of view, clearly, many hospitals would desire no price premium. We don't believe that's warranted, based on the acute performance of the stent and also the experience that we've seen in Europe, and we also have a terrific alternative for hospitals with our Promus PREMIER. So, it's our job to prove the unique benefits of the platform that justify the premium. We've done that in Europe ,and that will be our plans as well in the U.S. Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Keith, you want to comment? Keith D. Dawkins - Global Chief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, Glenn. We're also excited, obviously, about the post-approval study, the short DAPT trial with SYNERGY. Normally a post-approval study is a rather vanilla study, but on this occasion, with the agreement of the FDA, we can explore the unique properties of SYNERGY with this early and synchronous elution of the drug and polymer. Many patients, as you know, in the big DAPT trial were not randomized. Many patients spontaneously discontinued DAPT. So we put ourselves in a position, if the trial is acceptable, of having a unique product in the U.S. in relation to a short DAPT, which we and the agency, the FDA, think is very relevant. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks for the question, Glenn. Operator : And our next question will come from Brooks West with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Wanted to switch gears back to Urology, if I could. Can you talk about, what is in the guidance for AMS? Is that about \u2013 we've got about $167 million in our model for 2015 \u2013 is that about the right number? And then as a follow-up to that, I think that business, when you acquired it from Endo, was growing at about 3%. Obviously, you're putting up much higher growth in your Urology franchise. As you roll those revenues out into the broader footprint, should we be thinking about that 3% accelerating to more of 8% or 9% going forward? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Thanks for the question. We had a real strong quarter for our Urology business and our core business as we called out in the highlights here. Also, very excited about the integration. We're very committed to the $0.03 accretion in 2016 and $0.07 the year after. And we've really talked about the strong strategic fit with the company, particularly in the commercial channels and the portfolio fit between the two companies. It's just I've made a couple of high-level comments and Dan can provide some additional insights. In terms of the actual integration itself, we've planned for some minor commercial disruption in the fourth quarter and likely in the first quarter of 2016 given the size of the integration, some of the commercial moves that we're making and also to ensure that we have an appropriate level of stocking with our distributors in terms of inventory. So all that's in our model. So we believe that as we end 2016, as we've said before, that the AMS portfolio will be at least accretive to the BHC (49:04) overall business, and our core legacy business, pre-AMS in Urology, has actually grown accretive to our growth rate. So overall, we're very pleased with the progress that we're making. And Dan, any other insights on that? Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Nothing I'd really add to that. We're not going to break out the specifics of AMS that's in our guidance number for Q4. It's included in the 4% to 5% organic number that we have. So I think Mike's comments cover it well. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay. And just a follow up on CRM if I could. I know Ken's there. What's the timing on getting an MRI-safe TACE device in the U.S.? And then as we parse through your comments about your European growth versus your U.S. growth, as you get on cycle with everything in the second half of next year in the U.S., should we be extrapolating the growth you're putting up in Europe right now to the U.S. market in kind of late 2016 into 2017? Thanks. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, a couple things. In terms of some of the key approvals, it's tough to pin down precisely, but we project a first quarter \u2013 probably likely a late first quarter 2016 approval for our patient MRI \u2013 and a first half approval for our TACE \u2013 I'm sorry, our Quad device. So, again those are the key enablers for the U.S. getting back to positive growth in 2016. And without giving any additional guidance to 2016 in the U.S., that portfolio's performing very well in Europe. We'll bring it to the U.S and then we'll take it to some other markets like Japan. So, Ken, you have any insights on the clinical front on those areas? Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President & Chief Medical Officer-Cardiac Rhythm Management : Yeah. Yes, Mike. Brooks, I can fill in a little more. So on TACE MRI, I think U.S., to begin with, let's remember one of the major products gaps our competitors have which is subQ ICD. And we are hoping to be able to launch an MRI-safe S-ICD TACE device, both in Europe and in the U.S. at some point during 2016. In terms of older generation ICDs, trans-venous ICDs, we're really pleased with the reception in Europe with our MRI-safe labeling because we've been able to make it backwards compatible to our current generation of devices, EL and mini devices, as well as having an MRI conditionally safe, X4 Quad Pol CRT device. And we will be beginning U.S. clinical trials of those devices during calendar year 2016. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): That's very helpful. Thanks, Ken. Thanks, Mike. Operator : And our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question; just one on the tax rate and one on emerging markets. So, Dan, just starting with the tax rate, can you confirm that if the R&D tax credit is renewed, it's worth about 200 basis points or $0.02 in 2015? And so if it is renewed and the 2015 tax rate comes in at 11%, should we be thinking about 2016 about 100 basis points higher from that and 100 basis points higher in 2017? And I understand your philosophy, Dan, on the tax rate and being conservative until it's renewed. But just, can you just set expectations, if it is renewed, what the benefit would be? Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, Larry. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, 13% for this year. I think when the R&D tax credit, if it is renewed, is renewed, it depends what comes with it. A lot of times it doesn't just come as a one-sentence thing. There are other pieces that are attached to it. So I would say \u2013 I'd be comfortable saying \u2013 it's between 100 and 200 basis points. I don't think it's guaranteed to be 200. So we'll see if it is renewed and if it's renewed for 2015 and potentially 2016, we'll see what impact that has on our tax rate, but I'd say between 100 and 200 basis points. And then going forward, I'd look for our guidance in the late January, early February timeframe for 2016 tax rate guidance, but as you know, what we had said before is 100 basis points increase annually for the next few years. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. And then on emerging markets, it looks like your growth there this quarter was pretty steady, I think 13% organic, similar to last quarter. So Mike, could you give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing in emerging markets? Obviously, there's been some \u2013 it's been in the news a lot in the last quarter or so \u2013 and how sustainable you think that growth rate is that you put up this quarter? Thanks a lot. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Certainly as you indicated, some challenges in many of the emerging markets. The good news is we're growing consistently. So it's not quite the growth rates we delivered in 2014, but we put up a 13% in Q3 and I think it was at 12% or 13% in Q2. And so we really don't see that trend modifying. Really, the growth for us in the emerging markets continues to be on the heels of China, where we're growing strong mid-teens growth in China. We're also growing strong in India and we target about 10 emerging markets that we won't go through all of them on the call here that we put additional emphasis on. We continue to invest in additional training centers; we continue to invest in R&D capabilities outside the U.S., particularly in China and India; and we continue to expand our distribution reach in these key markets. So although the market's slowed a bit from our previous year's performance, we feel comfortable with our performance in Q3 and that trend going forward. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yep. Operator : And we'll go on to the next question in line. It'll come from Matt Taylor with Barclays. Please go ahead. Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Matt. Yes. Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. So my first question is obviously you're closing the AMS deal here and talking about getting back to normalized leverage levels. I guess just with the kind of M&A landscape that's out there, I think there's been a lot of smaller assets that have really come down in value, and I was just wondering how you're thinking about M&A in that context and what kind of leverage levels you'd be comfortable with if there's things out there where you can be opportunistic? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think our answer there really stays the same. We always look for \u2013 we're always looking for appropriate M&A activity. We've guided that we'll continue to look at tuck-in acquisitions that deliver strong ROIC, that exceeds our cost of capital ideally by year three. And so we'll continue to look. I know the market's been very volatile, but in the quarter itself we did a number of early stage venture investments, one being in mitral and a few others that we won't discuss \u2013 disclose publicly. So we always look and the markets have made, maybe the market's a little bit more ripe for M&A activity. Dan, any other comments there? Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I wouldn't comment on a specific leverage level, Matt, except to say that we're still committed to delevering as we had announced at the time of the AMS acquisition, to get back to our pre-AMS leverage metrics by the end of 2016, which is why we suspended the share repurchase program and prioritized some debt payment here in 2015 and 2016 as well. Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. And a couple of people have asked around this question, so I apologize if it's a little bit redundant, but I was wondering if you could just give us a flavor for how you see some of the different factors in your Rhythm Management group in terms of what the contribution could be once you lap some of these headwinds? Meaning, could you talk a little bit about the magnitude of the replacement headwind and how that abates? And then what you expect from MRI-Safe and Quad? Which of those is the biggest catalyst of the three and if you could talk a little bit about the timing, I think that might be helpful. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So really at this call, we're not going to provide any additional insights into our 2016 CRM guidance. We've reinforced a few times that our European business is performing mid to low single digit growth six consecutive quarters; bring those portfolios to the U.S. In 2016, we'll be faced with that replacement headwind for a big part of the year in 2016, but that'll abate more in fourth quarter 2016 into 2017. So, we're clearly positioned for improved performance going forward, given the product portfolio and the eventual reduction of the replacement cycle headwind. And we'll get more insights on that as we provide 2016 guidance. Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Last one, Brad. Operator : And that'll come from the line of Matt Keeler with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Matthew J. Keeler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just first on SYNERGY, I'm wondering if you can give us some color on how you're thinking about the ability of that product to drive unit share in the U.S.? Do you see the potential for that or is this more of something that gets you benefit on the price side? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we clearly are working that equation. We're confident that if we didn't drive a price premium that we could gain share quickly, but we don't think that's the right thing for the business for the long term. So we've been pretty consistent on that. We do believe we have the ability to gain share with SYNERGY despite a price premium, given the unique characteristics of the platform combined with the comprehensive other solutions that we offer including Chronic Total Occlusion, the WATCHMAN device and others in Interventional Cardiology. So, Keith, any other comments there? Keith D. Dawkins - Global Chief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. I think the superior acute performance of SYNERGY resonates with cardiologists in countries that we've launched the product in, and also obviously confirmed by the pivot \u2013 U.S. pivotal EVOLVE II trial \u2013 it has best-in-class stent thrombosis rates of 0.4% at 12 months. So I think the safety and the early healing characteristics of the device are appreciated, both by cardiologists and their patients. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. With that, we'd like to conclude the call. Thank you very much for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific. Before you disconnect, Brad will give you all the pertinent details for the replay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will connect a question and answer session and instructions will be given at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Susie Lisa, please go ahead. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights of the fourth quarter, Dan will review the financials for the quarter and then provide first quarter 2016 and full year 2016 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Keith Dawkins and Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin I'd like to remind everyone that on the call organic revenue growth is defined as excluding the impact of sales from divested businesses, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from the acquisition of the American Medical Systems or AMS Male Urology portfolio over the prior year period. Also note this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q4 and full year 2015 results and Q1 and full year 2016 guidance, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend, and other expenses. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs and 8-Ks filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Susie and good morning, everyone. In fourth quarter, Boston Scientific posted another quarter of strong results and closed out an excellent 2015 as we continue to execute against our strategic plan goals. At our May, 2015 Investor Day meeting, we outlined plans to drive mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and consistent adjusted operating margin expansion, which in turn will drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth, excluding the impact of FX. We are delivering against these objectives. In Q4, we grew worldwide sales 5% organically and 10% operationally, which includes the benefit of the AMS Urology business. We also grew adjusted operating income by 10% in the fourth quarter, which represents 100 basis point year-to-year improvement, to 21.7%. This solid revenue growth and margin expansion drove very strong 18% adjusted EPS growth to $0.26 and our fourth quarter results reflect our focus on delivering meaningful innovation while also providing clinical and economic value to our hospital customers. Importantly, our Q4 results built upon the consistent momentum generated over the past few years and contributed the following full year 2015 results. For the full year, we delivered 5% organic revenue growth and 8% operational revenue growth, which includes the acquired sales from Bayer Peripheral and AMS. In parallel with the consistent revenue growth, we are driving strong improvements to our operating margin. In 2014, we delivered 130 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin. In 2015, we delivered an additional 210 basis point improvement to a full year 22.3%. And per our previous goals, we continue to expect to deliver 25% plus adjusted operating margin in 2017, with plans to deliver an additional 200 basis points to 300 basis points of improvement by year-end 2020. We delivered full year of 2015 adjusted EPS of $0.93, representing 11% growth for the full year. It's important to note that 11% adjusted EPS growth includes a significant negative foreign exchange impact of $0.10 versus our original expectation of a $0.04 hit when we originally gave 2015 guidance. We're very pleased that we were able to overcome this FX headwind while investing in the long-term growth of the company, yet still delivering on our commitment for double-digit adjusted EPS growth. We continue to believe that Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to deliver differentiated shareholder value through durable mid-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth via our ongoing operating margin improvement initiatives. We're excited about our 2016 and our plans to build upon our global momentum. In 2016, we're targeting full year organic revenue growth of 4% to 7% and operational revenue growth of 7% to 10%. We are guiding adjusted EPS to $1.03 to $1.07, which represents 11% to 15% earnings growth. Importantly, this EPS once again includes an expected $0.06 negative impact from foreign exchange. I'll now provide some highlights on fourth quarter and 2015 results along with thoughts on our 2016 outlook. In my remarks, all references to growth are on an organic year-over-year constant currency basis unless otherwise specified. Our fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 5% was broad-based across businesses and regions, and was led by exciting new product launches, which continued global expansion and execution of our category leadership strategy. With the exception of the anticipated 1% decline in CRM sales, all of our other businesses grew organic revenue by at least 6% led by 10% growth in PI. IC had a strong quarter growing 6% against a very tough 10% comp in Q4 2014. And importantly, all three medical surgical businesses grew revenue at 7% while also improving segmented adjusted operating margin by 90 basis points year-over-year to 34.1%. We delivered another quarter of balanced global growth led by 6% revenue growth in Asia, 5% growth in the U.S. and Europe. Another highlight was strong 15% revenue growth in emerging markets, led by 20% growth in China and Brazil. The MedSurg businesses continued to deliver. In Endoscopy, we delivered 7% growth in Q4 fueled by the strength of our portfolio, our expanding global commercial reach and ongoing launches of our SpyGlass DS and AXIOS Stent. SpyGlass DS was launched in July 2015 and is an advanced single use visualization system for the diagnosis and treatment of complex disorders of the pancreas and bile ducts. It's truly a cornerstone product that is highly differentiated and complementary to our core endo portfolio. Our AXIOS Stent is used for transluminal drainage of pancreatic fluid collections and is also off to a strong start. We'll continue to innovate in endoscopic ultrasound and other exciting therapeutic categories including pulmonary and oncology to further enhance our global leadership in endoscopy. Urology and public health also continued a strong performance trend, growing 7% organically in Q4 led by laser fibers, capital equipment and strong international growth. Importantly this quarter we launched LithoVue, a disposable ureteroscope, which provides customers with visualization and navigation capabilities to diagnose and treat stones and other conditions of the kidney, ureter and bladder. And after closing the AMS Urology acquisition in August, we remain on track to realize our adjusted EPS accretion goals of at least $0.03 in 2016 and $0.07 in 2017. Neuromodulation revenue grew 7% in fourth quarter led by strong growth in both the U.S. and international. Sales were driven by the market leading Spectra platform and the launch of Precision Novi, our first product of the primary cell non-rechargeable market. In addition, we are seeing really promising uptake of our Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation System due to its Cartesia directional lead system and our partnership with Brainlab. Our U.S. DBS trial is making progress, and we expect to complete enrollment in 2016 and enter the market in late 2017 or early 2018. Our Cardiovascular group grew 7% in Q4 led by impressive 10% growth in Peripheral Interventions. The core PI business continues to execute and we're very pleased with integration of the legacy Bayer business. The legacy Bayer business grew over 20% for the second quarter in a row as we continue to grow share in the atherectomy market and we're encouraged by our early results from the global launch of our ZelanteDVT catheter, and the U.S. launch of our Innova Stent for the SFA. We also recently began to enroll our IMPERIAL U.S. IDE trial for Eluvia, our drug-eluting stent. And remain on track for a European launch of Eluvia this quarter. In addition, we recently closed the CeleNova transaction, which is a synergistic tuck-in acquisition focused on the treatment of liver cancer via localized delivery of chemotherapeutic agents. And finally in PI, we continue to benefit from our commercial relationship with C.R. Bard and the Lutonix Drug Coated Balloon technology. Interventional Cardiology continues to deliver with 6% growth in the quarter, which represents the sixth consecutive quarter of plus 6% growth in IC. Growth was led by worldwide imaging, U.S. and European drug-eluting stents, our complex PCI portfolio and Structural Heart. PCI guidance grew low teens globally and we're encouraged by the market enthusiasm of our integrated fractional flow reserve platform. In DES, the U.S. SYNERGY launch is going extremely well. We anticipate that SYNERGY will represent approximately 50% of our DES revenue mix in the U.S. by the end of 2016. In addition, we're launching SYNERGY in Japan and we'll continue to expand SYNERGY in other international markets. We also continue to invest in building upon the strong clinical evidence for SYNERGY as we have initiated the EVOLVE short DAPT study. Finally, the IC performance was fueled by our strengthening Structural Heart business, which includes our Lotus aortic valve and WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure device. We're truly in an exciting position to drive growth and share gains over the long run in these fast growing markets. Lotus delivered a strong quarter in the European market, as the platform continues to build momentum, despite our near-term size matrix limitations. Lotus offers physicians excellent control during implantation and best-in-class paravalvular leakage rates. In our RESPOND post-market study, 95.1% of patients had zero to trace PVL. Importantly, we completed enrollment in our REPRISE III IDE study in December, which we anticipate will position us for a late 2017 U.S. market entrance. We're also pleased to announce completion of the 1,000 patient RESPOND Lotus post-market study and those results will be presented at EuroPCR in May. We're expanding the Lotus platform and expect to launch our next gen 14 French delivery system along with additional sizes in Europe this year. Also in Structural Heart, the U.S. WATCHMAN launch continues to progress ahead of plan. We're pleased with the implant success rates and the high quality of patient outcomes thus far, which reflect our controlled rollout and proven training program. In addition, Dr. Vivek Reddy of Mount Sinai recently published in JACC a study highlighting WATCHMAN's cost effectiveness versus both warfarin and novel oral anti-coagulants. In the U.S., we opened more than 100 WATCHMAN accounts in 2015 and expect to open an additional 100 accounts in 2016. In Europe, we're looking forward to a full launch of our second-gen WATCHMAN FLEX which already has CE Mark. As for U.S. reimbursement, we await a final NCD decision from CMS by February 8 and we remain confident that WATCHMAN will represent at least a $500 million worldwide market opportunity. So overall, we're very pleased with our progress in Structural Heart and excited about our capabilities and the long-term prospects for this business. We exceeded our full year 2015 Structural Heart revenue goal of $75 million to $100 million and in 2016, we anticipate Structural Heart sales between $175 million and $200 million. Now turning to CRM, on our first quarter 2015 earnings call we projected a slowdown in our worldwide CRM sales for the balance of 2015 and through first quarter 2016, primarily due to replacement cycle headwinds and competitive launches in the U.S. Our forecast was accurate as global CRM sales declined 1% in Q4. However, we're very encouraged about our forward-looking CRM position given a strong cadence of new launches expected in the U.S. and Japan in 2016, our leading position and growing awareness of S-ICD, and our replacement cycle headwind becoming more favorable as we exit 2016. In the U.S., we plan to launch our full X4 Quad system with our Accolade Brady MRI safe system in the first half and EMBLEM MRI safe in the second half of 2016. And we anticipate these releases will strengthen 2016 CRM performance, particularly in the second half. Pacemaker sales again grew 2% and we recently launched X4 CRT-D Quad device. And while our ICD sales declined 2%, we continue to be pleased with our de novo ICD performance and the EMBLEM S-ICD in particular. EMBLEM continues to drive strong growth and de novo share gains in both Europe and the U.S. EMBLEM is building momentum globally and we look forward to launching EMBLEM in Japan this quarter with a reimbursement premium and expanding S-ICD to additional international markets in 2016. In Europe, we continue to gain share and grow our CRM business in the mid-single-digit range with our complete portfolio. These consistent European CRM results are encouraging as we look forward to our anticipated U.S. approvals in 2016. Lastly, in CRM we're continuously mounting third-party evidence of the economic benefits associated with our ENDURALIFE extended battery technology. And recently another third-party dataset from the EuroPace was published, demonstrating the six-year survival of BSC CRT-Ds over our competitors. Also, a recent U.S. study modeled a 14% reduction in Medicare cost from a two-year increase in ICD battery longevity. And an Italian study showed Extended Longevity drove a 29% to 34% reduction in long-term healthcare cost over a 15 year period. Turning to our EP business, we delivered 8% growth in the quarter. Our Rhythmia platform continues to roll out nicely driven by new installations and higher case volumes. We have a strong Rhythmia customer pipeline in 2016 as well as new platform enhancements scheduled for release. We did see some softness in EP in the fourth quarter primarily driven by the delay in our European launch of our IntelliNav ablation catheter, which we anticipate launching later in first quarter. We continue to strengthen our EP business and we look forward to continued progress in 2016. Our strategy of category leadership is working and it's helping us to become a stronger partner with our global customers. As the healthcare environment continues to evolve, we're building new capabilities to support our customers beyond our product portfolio with our Advantix solutions offerings. These offerings are focused on driving operational excellence within cardiovascular and GI labs, and improving the standardizing care for chronic cardiovascular diseases. And just last week, we announced an alliance with Accenture to develop a data-driven digital health solution to improve patient outcomes and reduce cost to treat patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases. So to wrap up my section, our company has great momentum and our 2015 results reflect the strength of our portfolio and our ongoing investment in the faster growth markets, our globalization efforts and execution of our global teams. More importantly, we believe that we are well-positioned to continue and strengthen our performance track record in 2016 and beyond. I'd really like to thank our employees for their winning spirit and a great commitment to Boston Scientific. Now let me turn the call over to Dan for a more detailed review of our financials. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Mike. I'll start with some overall perspective on the quarter before getting into the details. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.26, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range of $0.23 to $0.25, and representing 18% year-over-year growth in the quarter. Excluding a $0.03 unfavorable foreign exchange impact, Q4 adjusted earnings per share grew 31% year-over-year. The strong performance in Q4 was driven primarily by operational revenue growth and gross margin expansion. Our Q4 2015 adjusted operating margin of 21.7% represents an improvement of 100 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year 2015, total company adjusted operating margin expanded by 210 basis points over the full year of 2014 and we effectively offset a $0.10 FX headwind through operational savings and initiatives. Our full year 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $0.93 represents 11% growth and 23% growth excluding FX versus 2014. Now for the P&L highlights. For the fourth quarter of 2015, consolidated revenue of $1.978 billion represented operational growth of 10%, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding an approximate 500 basis point contribution from the AMS Male Urology portfolio, organic revenue growth was 5% in the quarter. On an as-reported basis, revenue grew 5% year-over-year. The foreign exchange impact on sales was a $110 million headwind compared to the prior year period, which was about $25 million worse than we assumed in our Q4 guidance range. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 72.8%, increasing 140 basis points year-over-year. The increase resulted primarily from cost improvements driven by our value improvement programs, as the impact of foreign exchange was negligible in the quarter. For the full year 2015, adjusted gross margin was 72% compared to 70.7% for the full year 2014. The 130 basis point full year adjusted gross margin improvement was driven by benefits of 180 basis points and 50 basis points from cost improvement and FX respectively. This was partially offset by 100 basis points of headwind attributed primarily to price. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $757 million or 38.3% of sales in the fourth quarter, down 10 basis points year-over-year. The Q4 rate includes 80 basis points of higher spend related to fixed asset write-offs, employee related benefits and litigation fees. Our full year 2015 adjusted SG&A rate of 37.4% is down 50 basis points versus the full year 2014. As a reminder, the medical device tax has been suspended for 2016 and 2017, which would benefit our adjusted SG&A rate by roughly 100 basis points annually. We're pleased to see that this tax has been temporarily suspended and intend to reinvest virtually all of the benefit into jobs, innovation, R&D, collaborations with universities and other initiatives that will help treat patients and sustain top line growth over the long-term. We expect the reinvestment of approximately 100 basis points to be split roughly equally between R&D and SG&A. Our guidance for full year 2016 assumes our adjusted SG&A rate will come down by a total of 140 basis points at the midpoint, which breaks down into 50 basis points from the medical device tax suspension and 90 basis points from operational improvements. Adjusted research and development expenses were $238 million in the fourth quarter or 12% of sales. For the full year 2015, adjusted R&D expenses were $850 million or 11.4% of sales. We expect our full year 2016 adjusted R&D rate to be roughly 11.5%. Again, this includes a 50 basis point increase due to the reinvestment of the medical device tax, offset by increased efficiency and improved utilization of our global footprint. Royalty expense was 0.9% of sales in both the fourth quarter and the full year 2015. This represents a 60 basis point reduction compared to the full year 2014 rate, and we expect our royalty rate to remain at approximately 1% of sales in 2016. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $429 million in the quarter, or 21.7% of sales, up 100 basis points year-over-year. We are very pleased with our consistent adjusted operating margin improvement throughout 2015 as we saw year-over-year improvement of at least 100 basis points in each of the four quarters. Rhythm Management's adjusted operating margin in Q4 was 13.9%, down substantially from Q3 2015, which resulted in a second half 2015 Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin of 15.9%, falling short of our expectation of 17% due to the timing of manufacturing variances and reserve charges as we transition our portfolio and prepare for new product launches in 2016. Full year 2015 Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin of 15% represents an improvement of 160 basis points over the full year 2014. And turning to 2016, we expect Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to increase sequentially in Q1 versus Q4 of 2015. With more noticeable improvement in Q2, as we begin to realize the full benefit of 2016 product costs and leverage the improved top line performance expected from the global CRM and EP franchises. And the second half 2016 Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin is also expected to benefit from our plant network optimization program completed at the end of 2015, which transferred a portion of our EP manufacturing to lower cost locations. The net of all these factors drive our expectation for full year Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to approach 18% for the full year 2016 and we remain confident in 20% plus in 2017. GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items of $700 million, was a loss of $271 million in Q4 2015. The primary GAAP to adjusted items for the quarter included; restructuring related charges of $26 million, acquisition-related SG&A expenses of $15 million, contingent consideration expense of $37 million, amortization expense of $135 million, and litigation-related charges of $456 million. The $456 million in litigation-related net charges were primarily related to increases in our litigation reserve for a recent appellate court ruling in Maryland in the Mirowski case. With the remainder related to a combination of increases in our transvaginal surgical mesh product liability reserves and other adjustments. The Mirowski case traces back to the mid-2000s and relates to licensing agreements on patents that have expired. We continue to believe that the facts and the law do not support the court's findings or the amount of the damages and we plan to seek review of the judgment by the Maryland Supreme Court. We increased our mesh reserve this quarter, as we became aware of additional claims during the quarter, as we continued to work through the settlement evaluation process. Currently, our known claim count is approximately 35,000, and we've agreed in principle to settle over 10,000 of those 35,000 claims. We intend to continue to contest cases against us vigorously, while also looking to settle when reasonable terms are presented. Our total legal reserve was $1.936 billion as of December 31, 2015. Separately, a case was recently filed against Boston Scientific in West Virginia, regarding the resin used in our transvaginal mesh products. We are confident that the resin used in the manufacturing of these devices is neither counterfeit nor adulterated, and meets required material bio-compatibility and design specifications. We've provided information and materials to DEKRA, a European Notified Body, the FDA and the Department of Justice regarding the resin, our quality processes and our commitment to producing medical devices of the highest quality. Now I'll move on to other income and expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $59 million compared to $54 million in Q4 of 2014. The increase was primarily due to the incremental debt raised in Q2 of 2015 to finance the AMS Male Urology portfolio acquisition. Our average interest rate was 3.9% in Q4 2015 compared to 4.8% in Q4 2014. The lower interest expense rate in Q4 2015 was primarily due to lower average cost of debt resulting from the senior notes refinancing completed in Q2 of 2015. Other expense was $10 million and this consisted primarily of foreign exchange losses and investment losses incurred during the quarter. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 58% on a reported basis and 0.2% on an adjusted basis. Our Q4 adjusted tax rate includes $3.9 million of favorable discrete tax items and other one-time benefits, primarily related to foreign exchange. Excluding these items, our Q4 operational tax rate would have been 13%. Now, I'll provide a bit more detail on our full year 2015 adjusted tax rate, where our guidance as of the third quarter had been 13%. As you may know, the U.S. R&D tax credit was permanently reinstated in December, which benefited the full year 2015 adjusted tax rate by slightly more than 100 basis points. We've decided to reinvest this benefit in our tax structure to improve long-term flexibility in our capital structure, the net result of this being a 13% adjusted tax rate for the full year, excluding discrete and one-time tax items and a 9.2% rate including them. After this one-time reinvestment, we continue to expect an approximately 100 basis point increase in our adjusted tax rate annually, and therefore continue to expect our full year 2016 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 14%. Finally, as mentioned, Q4 2015 adjusted EPS of $0.26, includes approximately $0.03 of unfavorable foreign exchange and represents 18% year-over-year growth or 31% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, Q4 2015 EPS was a loss of $0.11 and includes net charges and amortization expenses totaling $504 million after-tax. The GAAP loss of $0.11 compares to a GAAP loss of $0.23 in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year 2015, we reported adjusted EPS of $0.93, exceeding our guidance range, while absorbing $0.10 of unfavorable FX. Recall this is $0.02 more than we expected as of our Q3 2015 earnings call and $0.06 more than we had expected at the beginning of 2015. Full year 2015 adjusted EPS grew 11% over prior year and 23% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, 2015 EPS was a loss of $0.18 compared to a full year 2014 GAAP loss per share of $0.09. Moving on to the balance sheet. Days sales outstanding of 59 days increased one day compared to December of 2014. Days inventory on hand of 163 days was up seven days compared to December of last year, due primarily to the acquisition of the AMS Male Urology portfolio. Capital expenditures were $86 million in Q4 2015, compared to $79 million in Q4 2014. For the full year 2015, capital expenditures were $248 million. For the full year 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be roughly $100 million higher primarily due to the construction of our new manufacturing facility and distribution center in Malaysia. Beyond 2016, we expect capital expenditures to return to our historical run rate of approximately $250 million annually. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $448 million compared to $508 million in Q4 2014. Our full year 2015 adjusted free cash flow of $1.366 billion represents growth of 8% over the full year 2014. For 2016, we expect full year adjusted free cash flow to exceed $1.5 billion, representing growth of 10%, and have a stretch goal to exceed $1.6 billion for the year with initiatives aimed at improving the working capital contribution to cash flow. In Q4, we repaid $150 million of our term loan and expect to repay an additional $250 million by the end of 2016, at which time we expect our debt leverage will be consistent with our goal of returning to pre-AMS debt leverage by year-end. There were no share repurchases in the quarter, consistent with our decision to suspend the share repurchase program temporarily following the announcement of the AMS Male Urology portfolio acquisition, and near-term our capital allocation priorities are to repay debt, manage contingencies and pursue tuck-in M&A. We ended 2015 with 1.363 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our share count to increase by roughly 5 million per quarter through the end of 2016, as we plan to keep the buyback suspended for the balance of 2016. We expect this to result in a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.38 billion for the full year 2016. I'd like to conclude with guidance for Q1 and full year 2016. For the full year, we expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $7.9 billion to $8.1 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 4% to 7% on an organic basis, 7% to 10% on an operational basis and 6% to 8% on a reported basis. As a result of a stronger dollar, at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a roughly $150 million headwind for the full year 2016 on revenue. We expect our adjusted gross margin for the year as a percentage of sales to be in a range of 72% to 73%. We expect foreign exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 50 basis points on adjusted gross margin in 2016, as hedging contracts from our three-year program are layered in. We expect this headwind to be offset by a favorable mix, market segmentation, the ramp of accretive new products and our standard cost reduction programs. As mentioned, we expect our full year 2016 adjusted SG&A rate to be between 35.5% and 36.5% of sales, and our full year adjusted R&D rate to be between 11% and 12% of sales. This implies a full year 2016 adjusted operating margin in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%, the midpoint of which represents 170 basis points of improvement over full year 2015. And importantly, we remain on track to achieve an adjusted operating margin of 25% plus in 2017. Full year 2016 interest expense is expected to be $245 million, about $10 million higher than the full year 2015 due to incremental debt raised in Q2 of 2015. As mentioned, we expect our tax rate for the full year 2016 to be approximately 14%. As a result, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2016 to be in a range of $1.03 to $1.07 representing 11% to 15% adjusted earnings per share growth. We expect 2016 adjusted earnings per share to be impacted negatively by approximately $0.06 of FX or roughly $80 million of adjusted income. In terms of timing, this $0.06 should be roughly $0.02 per quarter in Q1 and Q2 and $0.01 per quarter in Q3 and Q4. Excluding the $0.06 of unfavorable foreign exchange, our full year adjusted EPS guidance range represents growth of 17% to 21%. Despite this approximate $0.06 hit, we remain confident in our ability to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Let me walk you through the 2016 adjusted EPS guidance. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.93 in 2015, representing 11% growth or 23% growth excluding the $0.10 of negative FX impact. As you know, our stated goal is to grow EPS double-digits, which would imply $1.02 in 2016. Adding $0.03 of AMS accretion, gets us to $1.05 which is the midpoint of our guidance. We expect unfavorable FX of approximately $0.06 as I mentioned, but our goal is to offset this through operational initiatives and savings as we did in 2015, and as mentioned, the medical device tax is worth roughly 100 basis points on the OM line but we intend to reinvest substantially all of that back into innovation and have developed the detailed plans to do so. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.62 to $0.67. Lastly for 2016, our guidance assumes pre-tax amortization of approximately $534 million. Now turning to the first quarter of 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $1.89 billion to $1.94 billion. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the headwind from foreign exchange should be approximately $45 million or 250 basis points relative to Q1 2015. We expect consolidated Q1 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of 4% to 6% organically and 9% to 11% operationally. For the first quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.23 to $0.25 per share and GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.11 to $0.13 per share. I encourage you to check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2015 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q4 results, as well as Q1 and full year 2016 guidance, including P&L line item guidance. So, with that, I will turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Dan. David, let's open it up to questions for the next 25 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. David, please go ahead. Operator : The first question will come from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions on 2016 guidance. So, the first is, your guidance at the top end of the range at 7% was obviously higher than we expected, I guess, we expected 4% to 6%. So, what factors get us to the top-end of that range and specifically what's assumed for WATCHMAN? And then I had a quick follow-up. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Good morning, David. Yes, the guidance 4% to 7% is higher than we showed at the recent Investor Day meeting. In terms of getting to the higher end of the range, we certainly have to have some good results on our product launches with SYNERGY, WATCHMAN, ongoing advancements of Lotus. We have key product approvals that we're expecting the first half, those need to come through. We also are launching a number of key products in Japan with SYNERGY and also S-ICD. So we need some strong execution there and continued emerging market growth. So it's \u2013 we've got a lot of product launches, a number of approvals needed. So to deliver the top-end of that we have to have excellent commercial execution and great execution on the regulatory side. Potentially on some of the downside, we continue to manage, as I mentioned, some of the CRM headwinds, which we anticipate will \u2013 after Q1 improve in second quarter and then improve dramatically in the second half of the year. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. That's very helpful, Mike. And then specifically, I know you mentioned CRM, just to follow-up there. In the fourth quarter, was there anything particular with that third quarter to fourth quarter slight decline, was there anything particular or unique to the fourth quarter that you can cite? And then once again your confidence, what's specifically implied in 2016 numbers? Is that \u2013 does 2016 guidance imply an improvement in the CRM business in 2016 over 2015? Thank you. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So we're really pleased with quite frankly our overall Urology business and the AMS deal. The business grew 7% in fourth quarter. And, I'm sorry, was your first question on Urology or is it all CRM related? David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I'm happy to hear about Urology, but I was focused on CRM, Mike. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sorry. The jetlag from Asia. We'll hold the Uro comments for later I guess. So on CRM, we do anticipate improvement clearly in 2016, as I mentioned, particularly in the second half. We anticipate the launch of the \u2013 the approval of the pacer MRI and the Quad in second quarter and we'll also have favorable comps in second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter. So we do see a strengthening CRM business in 2016. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Just a couple of things. Maybe start with the CRM operating margin. Dan, you did a very clear job of laying out the factors behind the 15.9% instead of your 17% goal. Is the whole of that these variances, and do you come into 2016 thinking that \u2013 do we start off with that sort of 17% level or better as we head into the first quarter, first half? Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Rick. Yeah, I think the way I would say \u2013 characterize that is on the Q3 call, we had talked about kind of being in that 17% range for the back half of 2015. The variances were a piece of it. We also had a little bit higher R&D, about 60 basis points in the quarter. That's timing, that's just going to come one quarter to another, so that doesn't concern me. The manufacturing and the inventory reserve charges are really in anticipation of the launches that Mike just mentioned around the MRI safe Brady and the Quad launch in the U.S. So those are kind of out of the way now at this point as opposed to having had to take those in different quarters. So I think, the way I would think of it is, the 13.9% in Q4, I'd expect a little bit of sequential improvement in Q1, not a tremendous amount, just a little bit. Q2 gets a little bit better than that and really the back half is where it accelerates to get to that overall 18% for the year. So, I wouldn't look for Q1 to be in that 18% range or Q2, but I think the net of the year, we're very comfortable with that 18%. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And just one product specific question, WATCHMAN, a possible NCD is up here real soon. And if I understood you correctly, you're basically saying you think it's still a $500 million market if that early language holds. But what if the language is basically equivalent to the FDA approval label? Docs are telling us that they're doing four patients a month and that would double if that were the case. Is that the way you see it and so then is it back to $1 billion market, how do we think about all that? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, overall, we're obviously very proud of our success in 2015 with WATCHMAN, in Structural Heart overall we delivered the high-end of the range there, we opened up 100 accounts. We're going to hear the NCD decision very shortly here. But, overall, we continue to expect guidance is 2016 of $175 million to $200 million. And our job will be to continue to focus on the penetration rate. With 15 million or so eligible patients, we'll continue to drive training programs, excellent outcomes, and \u2013 but for now, we'll continue with our $175 million to $200 million range, and we'll see what happens over the next few days on the reimbursement. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Ken, do you want to add anything? Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President & Chief Medical Officer-Cardiac Rhythm Management : Yeah, Rick. I'd say, while we have some concerns about that first draft of the proposed NCD, overall, it was consistent with our expectations, which are that the NCD we expect to be more limited than the full FDA label, likewise always expected to have the registry, et cetera. And as Mike said, we've always assumed modest penetration into the indicated population and really where we go is much more dependent on our ability to train new physicians to implant the device safely and effectively. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for that. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. So, just one quick follow-up on that. So, did you say where you ended up 2015 on that Structural Heart number? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We didn't give a \u2013 we guided $75 million to $100 million, and we beat the high end of the range. We didn't give a specific number. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : But didn't give the exact number, okay, great. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Over $100 million. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Over $100 million, understood. So, let me ask about SYNERGY and the launch so far, the feedback we're getting is, has been very positive particularly on the deliverability of the product. It does feel like you are trying to set a premium pricing for the product to the marketplace, can you talk about your success in doing so thus far? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yep. We're very pleased with the results. It's really tracking to our plan. In the fourth quarter, we did see U.S. DES growth in the mid-single-digit range and that was against about a 10% comparison from fourth quarter 2015, so we delivered a nice number in the first quarter. And just as you said, we are asking and we believe we deserve a pricing premium for the product. It's the only bioabsorbable product in the marketplace with excellent stent thrombosis rates and we also have a tiered offering that has excellent market share as well. So, we think we're uniquely positioned with it. And the great news is we're launching in Japan as we speak, which is obviously a big market, and we also received reimbursement in France. So, we're really positioned well. We're being very careful with the launch of it and similar to our comments at your meeting, we anticipate about 50% of our mix in the U.S. and Japan by the end of the year. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. One product follow-up, Mike, it sounds like Lotus Edge, the timing of introducing that in Europe may be is sliding, just can you provide some clarity on that? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I don't \u2013 in terms of sliding, we do anticipate 2016 we will launch Lotus Edge, and so I guess, maybe we did push that a bit, but we are confident in a 2016 launch of Lotus Edge and it really is similar to some of the comments on SYNERGY, we continue to exceed our commitments with Lotus. We exceeded the high end of our range, we're on track to deliver our 21 millimeter valve. We'll be launching our Lotus Edge platform and we continue to drive great outcomes on our clinical data, maybe, Keith, you can comment on some of the news you anticipate at EuroPCR? Keith D. Dawkins - Global Chief Medical Officer & Executive VP : Yeah. I mean, I think, Mike, the important thing is, when we commercialize Lotus in the U.S. late in 2017, we'll have Edge, we'll five valve sizes, 21 through 29. We'll have the [i-sleeve] 14 French compatibility and increased flexibility. The 21 valve is already in the clinical trial, so that will give us four valves. That will be followed by the 29. And we'll anticipate Edge around about EuroPCR or just after. Edge is already in clinical trials. So, we're very confident about moving to the 14 French compatibility, which of course makes us comparable with the other competitors in the market. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. Perfect. Thanks, Keith. Thanks, Mike. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks and good morning. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, just wanted to follow up and make sure I heard you correctly on the U.S. ICD and pacemaker pipeline and the timelines for the pipeline. So, specifically, could you just tell us when you expect Quad Pole CRT-D lead approval in the U.S. and then MRI-Safe pacemaker approval in the U.S.? And then also give us any updated thoughts on MRI-Safe traditional ICD and CRT-D timelines for the U.S., since it feels like that's where Medtronic is having the most success. Thank you. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. I'm really proud of our CRM business. We clearly want to grow faster, but we're in a position now where we can see as we go forward in 2016 and 2017 and beyond, really the strength of the portfolio and I'll give answers to your specific MRI questions in a second here, but we've got these product launches coming second half of 2016. The S-ICD is really gaining excellent momentum globally, we're expanding that and we're going to be moving beyond the replacement cycle headwind. In terms of the product launches, we feel comfortable with a second quarter launch of both the Quad system and MRI pacer. The MRI pacer likely slipped a little bit out of first quarter into second quarter. We'll also have EMBLEM MRI approval likely in the third quarter of 2016. So, big approvals in second quarter and third quarter. And then as we go forward with the ICD MRI capability, we'll start that trial very quickly here and we anticipate approval of that product likely in second quarter or third quarter of 2017. So, we've got a really strong cadence of product approvals coming, MRI capabilities. But I think what's most unique about our offering is this S-ICD momentum that we're seeing around the world. We just received approval in Japan. We have a 5% premium \u2013 reimbursement premium in Japan, continued strong acceptance of the product in training and a multi-year head start. So, as you look to our business going forward, this product cadence will come through, S-ICDs continuing to grow, and our replacement cycle headwind will reverse itself. So as you look forward to CRM, I really believe that you're going to see this business strengthen in the second half of 2016 and 2017 and 2018. Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then one for Dan, I just want to make sure I understand the margin story, just specifically in the fourth quarter. Is the right way to think about operating margins in the fourth quarter and all the moving parts that you had very strong gross margin performance, and that you took advantage of a very low tax rate to invest a little bit more in SG&A than you originally anticipated, is that from a big picture perspective the right way to think about Q4 margins? Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I think overall, and then as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we did have 80 basis points of the fixed asset write-offs and the litigation fees. So, I wouldn't call that kind of investing for the future. So if you take that off, I'd say, again, as we mentioned, very proud of where we ended for the year and the overall improvement we've had over the past two years. If you take 2016 and 2015 together, you'd be looking at almost 400 basis points of operating margin expansion. So in a given quarter, you'll see fluctuations, but the overall trend is extremely positive. Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : The next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you, and good morning, everybody. Maybe I will switch gears a little to the Urology business and maybe, Mike, you could talk about how the integration is going with AMS and very specifically focus on some of the issues that you may be undertaking to help accelerate top line growth from where AMS was performing at sort of the exit rate of the acquisition? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I won't give a CRM answer on this one. So, I guess, I just wanted to talk about Urology because I like what we're doing here so much. So we \u2013 again, we had nice results in the fourth quarter, business growing 7% overall, really nice job, particularly in international markets as we continue invest in our stone business and training programs, that's growing very well, double-digits outside the U.S. consistently. And the AMS integration is on track. Thankfully, the teams did a really nice job in due diligence. We did project some softness the first six months post acquisition as we wanted to bleed down distributor inventory levels to appropriate levels and that's exactly what we're seeing. So, that's happening and we likely will see continued softness in Q1, but improving in terms of the legacy AMS business, and that's being offset by the BSC legacy business. As we go forward in the second quarter, we expect the legacy AMS business to grow much closer to the BSC overall growth rate and then we'll see additional benefit on top of that as we see synergies between the BPH portfolio, the stone portfolio, the ED portfolio and the incontinence portfolio overall. So, really we're right on track. We're going to deliver our EPS accretion commitment of $0.03 in 2016 and I think it's $0.07 in 2017. So, the integration's gone well. We've had exceptionally low turnover and it's being met very well by the customers. David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful. Thank you. And then, maybe just a follow-up on the price/mix environment. As we sort of look at your growth rate, another acceleration potentially on tap for 2016 at the midpoint of your guidance on an organic basis. Can you maybe just sort of talk about how the pricing and mix environment is shaping up because at least from your \u2013 that your peers who have reported earnings results thus far, it sounds like the environment is a tad better, but maybe any thoughts from your perspective would be appreciated. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, David. This is Dan. In terms of price, as you heard, we mentioned it's about 100 basis point drag on gross margin, so you can kind of back into to what that is. Obviously we don't make assumptions about significant improvements in the pricing environment or significant deteriorations in that. It's contemplated within the range. But as we \u2013 as we look at it, it feels stable, so the product lines that have historically declined, are continuing to decline at that historical rate, they haven't moved significantly, and likewise, the ones where prices stay flat and in some cases increase, have stayed pretty constant and stable. So, over the past 12 months to 18 months, it's felt relatively stable and the guidance for 2016 assumes as that through the year. David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And mix? Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Mix \u2013 in general for us mix is a good guy. So as we as we sell more of the newer technologies, a lot of which Mike went through that list. The majority of those are accretive to overall Boston Scientific margins, gross margins. David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Brooks West with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Let me start with Peripheral actually, very strong performance there, you've got a lot going on. I wonder if you could give us just a little bit more detail on kind of product cadence, market dynamics and if we can see the business kind of continue to perform at this level going forward? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. The team has done a really nice job. Jeff Mervis and the Peripheral group delivered 20% growth in legacy Bayer business and 10% organically overall, so, obviously very strong growth and a few quarters in a row here, and we're projected to set up really nicely in 2016. So, I think just a backdrop, the markets there are very healthy, we're seeing nice market growth in atherectomy. Our core business, we just launched a new DVT product and also clearly the growing acceptance of the drug coated technology. So the markets overall are strong, and we really have a unique position in terms of our portfolio. You've heard a lot about our drug-eluding stent ELUVIA, we'll be the only company with both a drug-eluding stent and a drug-eluding balloon in Europe, and we're also kicking off our ELUVIA IMPERIAL trial in the first half of 2016. So we're uniquely positioned in our DES. We're also launching a number of our core SFA metal stents in Japan and Asia and China which will help us grow that business, and we also continue to really expand globally. We've been \u2013 we were light weight in terms of the emerging markets in Peripheral five years ago and we put a lot of investment in there and we're starting to see that become more meaningful in places like China and Brazil. And lastly, we commented on the call about our CeleNova deal. Our Interventional Oncology maybe a little bit different than some competitors' Peripheral business, but that IO business is a strong grower for us and we like that CeleNova transaction, particularly for the emerging markets. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Thanks. And if I could just follow up with one on \u2013 Dan, you mentioned earlier the leverage on the balance sheet was going to get back to pre-AMS acquisition levels by the end of the year. Can you just update us on your thoughts on acquisitions and are you seeing valuation expectations come down in the market? Thanks. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, Brooks. So, yeah, just in terms of the leverage levels, that's get \u2013 to get back to about a 2.5 times debt-to-EBITDA. We remain on track to do that as we had announced in conjunction with the AMS acquisition by the end of this year. We did the debt pay down that we needed to do at the end of 2015, and have in our cash flow projections in 2016 to do the remainder to get to that level. So feel very comfortable there. Relative to valuations and M&A, so we're still very active in the market relative to tuck-in M&A. Obviously, screen a lot of different opportunities. I wouldn't say I've seen significant changes in valuation expectations across the landscape, it would depend on what division and what stage you're talking about. But, in general, the valuations have stayed fairly constant and we are actively in the market obviously looking for tuck-in deals. And that is part of our cash flow projection for 2016 as well to be able to do some tuck-in deals. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So, Mike, you're one of the few companies that actually showed an acceleration in emerging growth this quarter, I think about 15% organic versus 13% last quarter, a lot of companies have shown the opposite trend. So, my question is, what's the outlook in 2016? How comfortable \u2013 how much visibility do you have on growth in those markets? And any color would be helpful and I had a follow-up. Thanks. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm sorry, were you talking the emerging market... Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Emerging market. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I'm sorry. Yeah, emerging market growth. I think you had 15% organic in Q4, I think 13% in Q3. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we were a little bit slower in the second quarter. And we had nice pick up, really the pickup the second half of 2015 was good, but it was also more consistent with what we expected and did in 2014 quite frankly. And so it's really a continuation of, ex maybe a soft quarter, one soft quarter, the second quarter, kind of a continuation of what we've been doing in 2014 and what we expect to continue to do in 2016. So, we had some softness in Russia in the second quarter, we've seen that stabilize a bit, we have excellent growth in China, excellent growth in Brazil and a number of other countries. So, we continue to register new products, add commercial capabilities, we're building R&D capabilities, new education training centers. I just got back from there last night. So, we put a lot of time and effort in it. We just did a joint venture deal with Frankenman there in our Endo business. So, we feel comfortable about our prospects in the mid-teens rate in emerging markets. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for that. And then Neuromodulation, I don't think has come up on this call, but you had a nice year in Neuromodulation this year, but obviously the competitive dynamics are changing. So just color on 2016 and how we should think about growth and trends there and the sustainability of the nice growth you showed in 2015? Thanks for taking the questions. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Larry, we'll hit that in a sec, but we're going back to the emerging markets revenue question first with Dan. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, just one other thing, Larry, on that. So one of the other items with respect to emerging markets is just the foreign currency exchange rates. So if you look back at Q4 and think of our $1.978 billion that we reported again, that included a $25 million negative headwind from FX compared to what we had talked about when we gave guidance. So kind of adjusted for that we would have been over $2 billion and kind of closer to the higher end of the range and emerging markets obviously is a big piece of that. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, Dan. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And Neuromod continues to perform well. We grew 7% in the quarter. We grew 8% full year and we had consistently strong growth throughout the year and we really don't see that \u2013 we anticipate that trend to continue. Spectra continues to perform very well. The launch of Novi outside the U.S. is picking up. And we are getting a lot of \u2013 we are building momentum in international markets in deep brain stimulation and will hopefully get some good luck and get that clinical trial enrolled in 2016 to position that launch. So it's a very healthy market right now and there is a lot of patient demand and so we like to see that that market is clearly growing in the mid-single digit range, if not a bit more. So it's a growing market. We have some unique innovation and it's a bit more competitive, but it hasn't slowed down our performance. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Larry. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. With that, we'd like to conclude the call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Susie Lisa. Please go ahead. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Roxanne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q1 2016 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights of Q1 2016, Dan will review the financials for the quarter and then Q2 2016 and full-year 2016 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Keith Dawkins and Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, organic revenue growth is defined as excluding the impact of sales from divested businesses, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from the acquisition of the American Medical Systems Male Urology portfolio over the prior year period. Also of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal Securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate, and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth in market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance including sales, margins, earnings and other Q1 2016 results and Q2 and full-year 2016 guidance as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Susie, and good morning, everyone. We continue to perform against our strategic planned goals, and we're encouraged by the consistent strong execution of our global team. The success of our new product launches across many of our businesses is helping us accelerate expansion into faster growth markets and deliver solutions that address unmet clinical needs. We continue to believe that Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to deliver differentiated shareholder value through durable mid-single digit organic revenue growth and double digit adjusted EPS growth through our ongoing operating margin and proven initiatives. We're very excited about the excellent start to 2016 and our plans to build upon our global momentum in 2017 and beyond. We posted excellent result this quarter with total operational revenue growth of 13% and organic revenue growth of 8%, excluding the impact of the AMS acquisition benefit. Four of our seven businesses grew revenue double digits organically and we, in turn, leveraged that revenue growth to drive 24% adjusted operating income growth, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 25.1% and a 260 basis point improvement year-over-year. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.28, exceeding the high end of guidance and representing 31% growth including the negative impact from foreign currency. Importantly, we're increasing our 2016 guidance for revenue, adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS. We're increasing our full-year organic revenue growth guidance from 4% to 7% previously to 6% to 8% full-year operational revenue which includes the benefit of AMS. It is being increased from 7% to 10%, to 9% to 11%. We're increasing our adjusted operating margin guidance to 24% to 24.5%. And we're also increasing our adjusted EPS guidance up $0.03 over our prior range to $1.06 to $1.10 which now represents 14% to 18% growth. And importantly, this EPS guidance includes an expected $0.05 or $0.06 negative impact from foreign exchange. I'll now provide some highlights on Q1 results and the 2016 outlook. And in my remarks, all references to growth are on a constant currency, organic, year-over-year basis excluding the benefit of AMS unless otherwise specified. Our Q1 revenue growth of 8% was broad-based across our businesses and regions, led again by exciting new product launches, continued global expansion and execution of our category leadership strategy. With the exception of the 3% decline in our Cardiac Rhythm Management sales, all of our other businesses delivered strong organic growth led by Endo at plus 11%, Urology and Pelvic Health, at plus 12%, Interventional Cardiology at 13%, and Peripheral Intervention at 14%. We also saw strong growth globally with Asia delivering 14%, U.S. 7%, and Europe up 6%. Emerging markets sales grew 21% including China sales at 19%. The MedSurg businesses all accelerated from Q4 of last year and delivered adjusted operating margin of 32.6%, up 360 basis points year-over-year. Endoscopy revenue grew 11% driven by our single-use SpyGlass Digital DS visualization system, the AXIOS stent for drainage of pancreatic fluid and the limited launch of our next generation hemostasis clip, the Resolution 360. We're also extending our category leadership in endoscopy by developing commercial capabilities in the emerging markets and adding a focus in pulmonary, which helped drive 15% growth in bronchial thermoplasty as it recently launched in both Japan and China. Urology and Pelvic Health organic growth accelerated at 12% and was broadly based with double-digit growth in kidney stone, pelvic floor and surg/gyn. Our legacy business grew 15% internationally led by 36% growth in the emerging markets. The AMS remediation and integration are on track and were delivered against our synergy commitments and the global teams are now fully integrated. As expected, standalone AMS sales declined slightly in the quarter and we expect inventory to be appropriate levels in second quarter. And LithoVue, an innovative single digital ureteroscope that provides customers with visualization and navigation capabilities will be featured in multiple presentations next weekend at the American Urology Association meeting in San Diego. Neuromodulation revenue growth accelerated 8% in first quarter and sales were driven by the market leading Spectra platform, the most flexible spinal cord stimulation system in the market, the launch of Precision Novi for the primary cell non-rechargeable market, and the solid contribution from our Vercise, our emerging deep brain stimulation platform. Our U.S. DBS trial is making great progress and we expect a launch in the U.S. in late 2017 or early 2018. In Cardiovascular, our segment sales grew 14% in the quarter and delivered adjusted operating margin at 34.1%, up over 350 basis points both sequentially and year-over-year. Peripheral sales grew 14%, on strong results in atherectomy, thrombectomy, and our Innova bare-metal and Eluvia drug-eluting stent platforms. The legacy (07:52) Peripheral business continued its recent impressive trend as we grow share in the atherectomy market and see very strong demand for our new Zelante deep vein thrombosis platform. The Eluvia IDE trial called IMPERIAL is on track to complete enrollment by late 2016 or early 2017, and we look forward to presenting 24-month data from our initial trial, MAJESTIC, which had a 12-month patency rate of 96.1% later this year. We're also seeing continued progress with our Lutonix distribution agreement and encouraging EU sales of our Ranger drug-coated balloon. We're excited to be the only company developing leading drug-eluting technologies globally on multiple platforms, providing physicians with a variety of tools for treating complex peripheral vascular disease. Interventional Cardiology turned in another double-digit quarter at 13% growth, led by complex coronary drug-eluting stents, PCI guidance, and Structural Heart. SYNERGY had a very strong quarter and we estimate that we added to our market-leading share position in the U.S. and regained market leadership position in Japan. DES sales grew 14% in the quarter and we believe SYNERGY is on track to represent approximately 50% of our U.S. DES revenue mix by the end of the year 2016. PCI guidance again grew double digits on continued share gains on intravascular ultrasound, and we're encouraged by strong feedback and the ease of use of our Comet fractional flow reserve platform. Our leading portfolio solutions for complex high-risk PCI patients continues to drive global growth as well. The 13% IC revenue growth was also fueled by our strengthening Structural Heart business which includes our Lotus transcatheter aortic valve and a WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure device. We believe we are uniquely positioned to drive long-term growth in these two fast-growing markets via our differentiated platforms. Our Lotus valve continues to gain share in Europe, and we are investing significantly to further develop our capabilities. Most recently, best-in-class paravalvular leakage rates were reported for Lotus at ACC last month with pre-discharge rates of 0.4% for moderate paravalvular regurgitation in the first 750 patients of the respond post market study. We also continue to plan for the U.S. launch with the LOTUS EDGE delivery system at the end of 2017. And we also completed an enrollment in our REPRISE Japan trial where we targeted a 2018 launch. Importantly, the LOTUS EDGE features a 14 French compatible sheath, more flexibility, simplified deployment and our new depth guard technology which controls depth of the valve in a left ventricular outflow tract. Studies to demonstrate an improved permanent pacemaker rate with this optimized technique will begin enrollment in mid-2016. Also, in Structural Heart, WATCHMAN sales were strong and procedure growth and new account openings both helped by the finalized national coverage determination. We're developing additional WATCHMAN capabilities, primarily by adding resources in field clinical support, market development and training courses. Implant success rates and patient outcomes remain very high quality due to our controlled rollout and proven training programs. In the ACC earlier this month, Dr. David Holmes of the Mayo Clinic presented data from the first 1,600 patients implanted with the WATCHMAN commercially and reveals 96% procedural success and an average procedure time of 50 minutes. So, overall, we're very pleased with our progress in our 2016 revenue guidance of $175 million to $200 million in Structural Heart revenue. Rhythm Management segment sales declined 2% in the quarter, yet delivered adjusted operating margin of 16.8%, which is up 290 basis points sequentially as improving profitability remains a core focus. In CRM as anticipated, sales declined 3% as we faced competitive launches in the U.S. and replacement cycle headwinds. We're optimistic for a second quarter and second half 2016 improvement in our CRM performance. Also as projected, we received two key FDA approvals in March for our ACUITY X4 Quad CRT lead and earlier this week for our ACCOLADE brady MRI platforms including the INGEVITY MRI pacing lead. Pacemaker sales grew 3% globally aided by our recently launched X4 CRT-P Quad device while worldwide ICD sales declined 4%. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of the EMBLEM S-ICD, which is enjoying strong growth in both Europe and the U.S. and is currently launching in Japan. In electrophysiology, we're encouraged by double-digit growth in Europe led by our RHYTHMIA installations and the recent launches of the IntellaNav OI and IntellaTip MiFi OI ablation catheters. In the U.S., we're now launching our Blazer Open-Irrigated Therapeutic Catheter for the treatment of Type 1 atrial flutter as we continue to invest in the franchise, launch a portfolio of navigation-enabled therapeutic catheters and build capabilities in capital equipment sales and service. We have a strong RHYTHMIA customer pipeline as many of our new platform enhancements scheduled for release in 2016. So, to wrap up, our company had an excellent quarter. First quarter results reflect the strength of our portfolio, our ongoing investment and faster growth markets and our globalization efforts. More importantly, we are well positioned to continue our strong performance in 2016 and beyond. I would like to thank our employees for the continued winning spirit and their commitment to the company. Now, let me turn the call over to Dan for a more detailed review of our financials. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Mike. In Q1, we generated organic revenue growth of 8% versus our 4% to 6% guidance range and adjusted EPS of $0.28, exceeding our guidance range of $0.23 to $0.25, and representing 31% year-over-year growth. Adjusted EPS of $0.28 includes a slightly lower than expected tax rate for the quarter due to some discrete tax items. The strong performance in Q1 was driven primarily by revenue growth upside, gross margin expansion and a lower SG&A rate versus the prior year. And as Mike mentioned, given the outperformance in Q1, we're raising full-year guidance for revenue growth, adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS. Consolidated revenue of $1.964 billion represented operational revenue growth of 13% which excludes the impact of a $58-million headwind from foreign exchange. Excluding an approximate 500-basis-point contribution from the AMS Male Urology portfolio acquisition, organic revenue growth was 8% in the quarter. On an as-reported basis, revenue grew 11% year-over-year. Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 72.3%, increasing 100 basis points year-over-year. The increase resulted primarily from cost improvements driven by our value improvement programs and favorable mix, partially offset by price. And similar to Q4 of 2015, the impact of foreign exchange on gross margins was negligible on the quarter. We continue to expect full year 2016 adjusted gross margin to be in the range of 72% to 73% which we forecast to include approximately 50 basis points of unfavorable FX. Our Q1 2016 adjusted operating margin of 25.1% represent a 260-basis point improvement over Q1 2015 which marks the seventh consecutive quarter in which we've expanded adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points or more. There was very modest reinvestment of the medical device tax benefit in Q1, which represents some timing favorability in the quarter, but we are committed to reinvesting substantially all of the full year benefit during the year. Thus, adjusted SG&A expenses were $698 million or 35.5% of sales in the quarter, down 150 basis points year-over-year with some of the benefit due to our targeted initiatives focused on reducing SG&A, and a portion due to the more modest medical device tax benefit reinvestment I just mentioned. Our Q1 adjusted SG&A rate was the lowest in the last 12 quarters, and we continue to believe our full-year rate will be between 35.5% and 36.5%, which, at the midpoint, would be a 140-basis-point reduction compared to 2015. Adjusted research and development expenses were $209 million in the first quarter or 10.7% of sales, which is roughly flat year-over-year. This is another key area for us to reinvest the benefit of the medical device tax suspension. As a result, we expect our full-year 2016 adjusted R&D rate to be between 11% and 12% of sales. Royalty expense was 1% of sales in both Q1 of this year and last year and consistent with our guidance. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $494 million in the quarter or 25.1% of sales, up 260 basis points year-over-year. Q1 adjusted operating income grew 24% year-over-year with all three reportable segments expanding adjusted operating margin by at least 250 basis points over Q1 of last year. Of particular focus is Rhythm Management, which delivered an adjusted operating margin of 16.8%, which is up from Q4 2015's 13.9% and the full year 2015 rate of 15%. For the first half of 2016, we expect Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to be slightly above 16%. In the second half of 2016, we expect Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to increase roughly 200 basis points over the first half rate. This second half improvement is expected to result from realizing the full benefit of 2016 product costs, leveraging the improved top line performance expected of the global CRM and EP business, and realizing the full benefits of our plant network optimization program which is transferring a portion of our EP manufacturing to lower-cost locations. We continue to believe Rhythm Management is on track to deliver an adjusted operating margin of 20% in 2017. GAAP operating income which includes GAAP to adjusted items of $201 million, was $293 million in Q1 2016. The primary GAAP to adjusted items for the quarter included amortization expense of $136 million, restructuring related charges of $13 million, acquisition related SG&A expenses of $14 million, and litigation related charges of $10 million. Our total legal reserve was $1.895 billion as of March 31, 2016. Now I'll move on to other income and expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $59 million compared to $56 million in Q1 last year and the increase was primarily due to the incremental debt raised in Q2 of last year to finance the AMS Male Urology portfolio acquisition. Our average interest rate was 4% in Q1 2016 compared to 5.1% in Q1 last year. And the lower interest expense rate in Q1 this year was primarily due to lower average cost of debt resulting from the senior notes refinancing which we completed in Q2 last year. Other expense was $10 million and this consisted primarily of foreign exchange losses and investment losses incurred during the quarter. Our tax rate for the quarter was 11.4% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an adjusted basis. Excluding discrete tax items in the quarter, our adjusted tax rate would have been 13.5% and we continue to expect our full year 2016 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 14%. On a reported GAAP basis, Q1 2016 EPS was $0.15 and includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $176 million after tax. GAAP EPS of $0.15 compares to break even in Q1 of last year. Moving on to the balance sheet, DSO of 60 days increased one day compared to March of last year. Days inventory on hand of 162 days was down four days compared to March of last year and one day from year end 2015. Capital expenditures were $59 million in the quarter compared to $46 million in Q1 2015. And as a reminder, we expect full year 2016 capital expenditures to be roughly $350 million. This is $100 million higher than the full year 2015, primarily due to the construction of our new manufacturing facility and distribution center in Malaysia. And beyond 2016, we expect capital expenditures to return to our more historical run rate of approximately $250 million annually. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $250 million compared to $118 million in Q1 2015, and this strong start gives us confidence in our adjusted free cash flow target of $1.5 billion which represents 10% growth, and better visibility to our stretch goal of $1.6 billion which would represent 17% growth, even in a year with an incremental $100 million in CapEx spend as I mentioned. We're also continuing to pursue inventory management initiatives designed to improve the working capital contribution to cash flow. In Q1, we used cash primarily to fund previously agreed legal settlements as well as business development activities. Consistent with our goal of returning to pre-AMS debt leverage by year end 2016, we still expect to repay $250 million of bank term loans by the end of this year. As of March 31 this year, we had cash on hand of $338 million. Near term, our capital allocation priorities are to prepay debt, manage our contingencies and pursue tuck-in M&A. We ended the quarter with 1.370 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our share count to increase by roughly 5 million per quarter through the end of the year, as we plan to keep the buyback suspended for the balance of 2016. We would expect this to result in a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.380 million for the full year 2016. I'd like to conclude with revenue and earnings per share guidance for Q2 and full year 2016. For the full year, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $8.075 billion to $8.225 billion which represents year-over-year growth of 6% to 8% on an organic basis, 9% to 11% on an operational basis which includes the AMS revenue, and 8% to 10% on a reported basis. As a result of a stronger dollar, at current rates we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $100 million for the full year 2016. As we move through 2016, we are reinvesting the benefit of the medical device tax suspension into innovation to help treat patients and sustain top line growth over the long-term. Focus areas will include R&D efforts including clinical trial spend as well as market development, and in Q2, we've already begun to ramp this reinvestment, primarily in the areas of Structural Heart with both Lotus and WATCHMAN, and other durable long-term revenue growth platforms such as the EMBLEM S-ICD, our electrophysiology portfolio, deep brain stimulation and other fast-growing adjacent markets. In addition, Q2 is our seasonally high SG&A spend quarter, partially due to the highest tradeshow activity of the year. Thus, for Q2 2016, and consistent with prior years, we would expect a sequential decline in adjusted operating margin to a range of 23% to 24% which, at the midpoint, represents 140 basis points of improvement year-over-year, and puts first half 2016 adjusted operating margin at 200 basis points, up versus the first half of last year. For the full year 2016, we are raising our adjusted operating margin guidance from 23.5% to 24.5% to a range of 24% to 24.5% now, which also represents a 200 basis point year-over-year gain. This gain is from operational efficiencies and not the med device tax as we are reinvesting the benefits. Turning to adjusted EPS, we now expect full year adjusted EPS for 2016 to be in a range of $1.06 to $1.10, representing 14% to 18% adjusted earnings growth and an increase of $0.03 to each end of the range compared to our prior guidance. Now, let me walk you through our updated assumptions for the FX impact on adjusted EPS. Our initial 2016 guidance assumed $0.02 of unfavorable FX on adjusted EPS in Q1 and $0.06 for the full year. In Q1, the combination of exchange rate movements and timing of hedging contracts resulted in an unfavorable impact of $0.01, and we now believe the full year 2016 unfavorable impact will be $0.05 to $0.06. In addition to the $0.01 in Q1, we would expect the remaining $0.04 to $0.05 of unfavorable FX for the full year to break down into $0.02 in Q2 and $0.02 to $0.03 in the second half of 2016. Excluding the unfavorable foreign exchange, our full year adjusted EPS guidance range represents growth of 19% to 24%. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.64 to $0.69. Now turning specifically to Q2 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $2.010 billion to $2.060 billion. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the headwind from FX should be approximately $25 million, or 135 basis points relative to Q2 of last year. We expect consolidated Q2 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of 6% to 8% organically and 11% to 13% operationally. For the second quarter, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.25 to $0.27 per share and GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.14 to $0.17 per share. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q1 2016 financial and operational highlights which outlines Q1 results as well as Q2 and full year 2016 guidance, including P&L line item guidance. So, with that, I'll turn it back to Susie who will moderate the Q&A. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Dan. Roxanne, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Roxanne, please go ahead. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins, Bank of America. Please go ahead. Robert A. Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, thanks and good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. So, to start out, Mike, obviously this is one of the best growth quarters you guys have had in a while, and congratulations on the great start to the year. I was wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about just the broader macro environment and the health of the markets you're in, and maybe just talk about the factors driving growth. And I would really appreciate it if you could talk a little bit about Uro and Endo as well and some of the products that are driving growth in that division because obviously that's where you had some really nice outperformance Thanks. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yep. Yeah. Good morning, Bob. Thanks for this question. Overall, the market growth we see consistent with what we've mentioned in the past, kind of playing in 3% to 4% growth markets overall for Boston Scientific. And similar to our Investor Day presentation, we're investing in the faster growth markets that would basically accelerate the growth profile another 100, 200 basis points in the markets that we serve. So, with kind of similar growth rates in IC and Cardiology and CRM kind of in the low-single-digit range and more in the 4% to 5% market growth rates for our MedSurg. But I guess what we're most proud of is really, across the board, with the exception of CRM, we're growing \u2013 and EP, we're growing significantly faster than our competition. And that's really driven by our product launches and really excellent global execution. We're really pleased with the growth in Asia. Profit almost 15%, very strong growth in Japan, very strong growth in Europe. So, across our businesses or regions, our teams are really delivering. In terms of your question on Endo and Urology, we're very thoughtful about the AMS acquisition and we're seeing the benefits of the commercial synergies between those organizations given the additional commercial footprint that we have as well as the broadness of the bag. And you're seeing that with a really acceleration of our legacy Urology division, in part due to the synergies of our AMS business. We continue to invest in physician training for our Stone Institute, and we continue to benefit from the category leadership based on the premise of the AMS acquisition. In Endoscopy, it's a very innovative division, and we continue to lead innovation with our digital SpyGlass system which is really a terrific platform for us that we can continue to build from, and that also helps drive pull-through of our core portfolio. So, the R&D teams are executing as well as the commercial teams, and we continue to be committed to our durable mid-single-digit revenue growth, our operating margin expansion, and our double-digit EPS growth over the long term. Robert A. Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks for that. And then a follow-up maybe for Dan. Dan, can you just help us? Was there any, in your view, selling day mismatch this quarter versus a year ago? And then on the operating margin performance in the quarter, it sounds like over the course of the rest of the year, there's going to be some incremental spending because obviously you're guiding to a lower operating margin than you started out in Q1. So, maybe just comment on the selling day year-over-year, and then also maybe quantify and describe some of the extra spending that you're going to be undertaking here in the remainder of the year. Thank you. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, Bob. First, quickly on the calendar, no, we don't believe there's an extra impact in Q1. There was obviously a leap year day. But then when you factor in the timing of the Easter holiday, believe it's a true 8% growth for the quarter organically. Relative to operating margin, so I think when you look at Q1 at the 25%, and then you look at the 24.25% which is the midpoint for the full year, one of the key changes there is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the reinvestment of the medical device tax benefit over the rest of the year. So, little delayed in Q1 getting off to that start, but committed to reinvesting the entire amount for the rest of the year, so that's one. And I think there's R&D timing as well in Q1, so, our Q1 R&D was 10.7%. If you look at the guidance range, you'd see 11.5% at the midpoint. Part of that's the med device tax reinvestment, and part of it's just the timing of overall R&D. So, that's another 80 basis points there going from the 10.7% in Q1 to the overall average of the 11.5% for the full year. So still, as you look at the 24.25%, still significant growth versus last year, 190 basis points, and feel good that we're striking a good balance between delivering differentiated adjusted operating margin and investing for a continually growing top line for the future. Robert A. Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Just a few quick questions. Mike, I guess the issue for us this quarter is that we expected an inflection quarter sometime this year. Obviously, it's coming earlier. But I guess as we think about the balance of the businesses, we actually thought there could be acceleration from whatever the growth rate was in the first quarter out. And I wonder, can you point us to tailwinds, headwinds in the business throughout the balance of the year based on this thought of acceleration throughout the year? And then, with specific attention, perhaps, within cardiovascular, you talked about those businesses, but in terms of stents, WATCHMAN, Lotus, what's really driving that strength in cardio? So, acceleration and then, particular cardiovascular, and I have one quick one for Dan. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That is a multipoint question. Thanks, Dave. Just overall we are pleased with our performance in the quarter. We took the guidance up from 4% to 7%, to 6% to 8% organically, not impacting AMS. And as I mentioned, the businesses and regions are performing at a nice level. As we look, we obviously anticipate a solid second quarter given our 6% to 8% guidance in second quarter. We do face a couple headwinds throughout the year. We do anniversary some key product launches in our Peripheral Vascular as well as our Endoscopy business. We do anticipate some Japan reimbursement cuts that we'll be working through. And we're very bullish on our WATCHMAN program, but we're also anniversarying the initial launch. So, there are a few headwinds but overall, we have an excellent product cadence. The business is performing well. And we feel comfortable with raising our guidance to 6% to 8%. On the Cardiology side, we're seeing excellent \u2013 our strategy play out. We continue to diversify our Interventional Cardiology portfolio. As we've talked in the future, we really see, in the future, about a third of our business coming from Structural Heart, about a third from Imaging and complex coronary, and about a third from drug-eluting stents. And across those three slices of the pie, we're doing a nice job of delivering in the short-term and investing for the long-term. Our SYNERGY program is really going as planned. We're on track for SYNERGY to represent about 50% of our mix at a appropriate premium price. And physicians continue to see the benefit of the deliverability and the excellent zero-step thrombosis at beyond the first 24 hours, so excellent clinical data there. Our Complex Coronary business continues to do well as well as our imaging business. And in Structural Heart as Dan mentioned, I'm actually over in Korea as we speak here. We just had a live case from Australia today and just physician reaction to the deliverability and low PVL rates of our Lotus valve continues to be very high. And so, we are really increasing our investment in that category, given the size of the market potential in the future, and also given the differentiation that we believe that Lotus delivers and our commercial capability. So, hopefully that gives you a bit of flavor. We're pleased with our raise on the guidance and we'll manage our headwinds to continue to hopefully deliver revenue growth at the top tier of our sector. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right, Mike. That's great color. And Dan, I hate to bore you with a nit here, it was such a good quarter. But we're actually getting your constant currency growth rate this quarter as even higher than you reported. We have a $58 million FX headwind for a 3.3% headwind versus 2%. Are we missing something here in the quarter? And we can take it offline if we're off our rocker. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, David. I think it's just the rounding of 3%. The way we see it is 3%. So, it's just a little bit in the rounding of the numbers. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks so much. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yep. Thanks, David. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Mike Weinstein, JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, guys. So, when's the last time Boston Scientific grew 8% organic? You guys know the answer? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll bet you Dan knows. I don't. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'd say 10 years, Mike. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : 2Q 2005. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's right. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: There you go. Let's do it again. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : What strikes me in particular is if I look at the U.S. performance and I back out CRM and I back out AMS, I'm getting to about 15% growth for the U.S. business in aggregate, which is obviously very, very strong. So, I want to circle back first to Bob's question just to make sure you don't think that there's anything kind of unusual going on in selling days, and I heard your answer there. But we are seeing this particular strength, and not just Boston Scientific. We've seen this in some other end markets over the course of the past week that have come in stronger. Anything that you think is going on that showed up this quarter in particular that is driving this real increase in volumes? And I'm speaking not just of your own performance, but do you have any theories on the broader market looking stronger this quarter than we've seen in a while? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Good morning, Mike. We don't see a big change in the market from our peers that have reported. We were seeing a 1% to 4% growth rate with the exception of one, which is higher than ours. So, we do feel like we're growing faster than most of our peers. And I also think we're going through maybe a bit of a cycle of some good innovation and some mix benefit. We clearly see a lot of enthusiasm, for example, for S-ICD, despite our headwinds in the near term on MRI, which we're pleased with the pace for approval, we're getting nice mix benefit from S-ICD as well as global uptick of the S-ICD, particularly in Japan. And I think our strategy of category leadership, which we've really stressed for a number of years now is starting to pay off. Many of the large systems in the U.S. are willing and wanting to partner with Boston Scientific given our current platform as well as the pipeline that we've committed to. So, I think the markets are steady. We have a nice pipeline that's helping some of our mix benefit. And I think, importantly, we're really building up our capabilities outside the U.S. Our Asia business grew very well. And just this year, we've done a grand opening for our Malaysia plant. We have a new R&D center in India. We have new training centers. So, our capabilities in Asia are significantly stronger than they used to be. So, that's also helping to strengthen our business. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Mike, if I look at the Interventional Cardiology business in the U.S., if I look at the Peripheral Vascular business in the U.S., I mean, both just had exceptional quarters; Interventional Cardiology up 21%, Peripheral Vascular up 13%. Would you mind just peeling the onion a little bit and help us understand how those businesses are doing as well as they are? Because obviously, that's well above expectations. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think it really speaks the category leadership. So, two words that get used a lot in the industry, but I think we're delivering it. We have an excellent portfolio. Interventional Cardiology, as I mentioned, I'm in Korea here at this large conference. And we believe we have the best drug-eluting stent in the marketplace. We have an excellent imaging platform with IVUS and we're launching FFR. We're the leaders in chronic total occlusion. We have the WATCHMAN product for interventional cardiologists who want to implant it, and a very promising and differentiated TAVR valve. So, I think our category leadership strategies are working in cardiology, and similarly in Peripheral Vascular with our \u2013 I won't go through all of them, but the Bayer acquisition, really has exceeded the investment models that we've had in terms of synergies and growth. And our drug-eluting stent platforms with the stents and the balloon are doing quite well. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I'll let some others jump in, but congratulations, guys, on a obviously a fantastic quarter. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Mike. Appreciate it. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from Rick Wise, Stifel, please go ahead. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, Mike. Good morning, everybody. Let me turn to one area of weakness. Obviously, CRM, High Power down 4%, Mike. Can you talk a little bit more about that? And specifically, you called out the replacement headwinds. You've been talking about the replacement headwinds in CRM and High Power for a while. My sense is from your comments in the past is that that \u2013 it's going to shift more to neutral or even a tailwind at some point in the not too distant future. Can you give us any more concrete thoughts about when that happens and the kind of drag it is now and how that could change as we look to 2017 and beyond? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Rick. Just regarding our CRM performance broadly and I'll comment on the replacement headwind. It's really as we projected almost a year ago. We knew we were going to have some challenges in the U.S. Our Asia business, our Japanese business and our European business in CRM are doing quite well and growing either at or above market. And the two launches will help us improve growth, we anticipate, in the second quarter and for the second half. And also the team continues to improve operating income margins despite negative growth in the quarter which is good to see. On the replacement headwinds, we don't have any additional breakdown of data that we're going to provide on this call. But I will say \u2013 and I think in the future we'll consider providing some additional detail so we can quantify that \u2013 but similar to our last call, I do think we have brighter days ahead of us in CRM, with a pacer MRI approval, with a Quad approval. We've also initiated our MRI approval for our defib platform which we see getting approval in mid-2017. So, the portfolio is very strong. We'll have EMBLEM MRI likely approved in U.S. in third quarter. And so, we do see the headwind of the replacement cycle improving at the end of 2016, which will help us in 2017. So, with a product cadence and improve replacement cycle headwind, we see some brighter days for our CRM business. And in the future, we'll look at quantifying more precisely some of the benefit of that tailwind on the replacement cycle. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. And as a follow-up, maybe turn to WATCHMAN. Are you inclined to give us any kind of numbers for the quarter? You're adding field support; you're on track for the next 100 accounts. Was there any stocking? Maybe any more granular detail about the progress you're making and the impact of the NCD? Thanks again. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yep. WATCHMAN team is doing a nice job. Most importantly, we continue to believe in our $175 million to $200 million in Structural Heart revenue guidance. We're on track as planned to open up another 100 centers, and we, again, continually have very thoughtful training program. The NCD's a very good outcome for us and it really reassures and strengthens our view as to the potential size of the market. And we invest, as you mentioned, in clinical specialists. We're investing in physician training and really to build up the market the appropriate way. So, we're really delivering as planned and we're very pleased with the outcomes and the enthusiasm with WATCHMAN globally. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks again. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And Rick, I would probably just add one little bit of color on the replacement headwinds as well. It's kind of a tale of two pieces within the franchise there. So, as Mike said, as we head into the end of 2016 and more likely 2017, you'll see the \u2013 more of a tailwind on the CRT-D side \u2013 and then it's more of an ending 2017 into 2018 on the traditional transvenous ICD side. So, there's a little bit of a bifurcation on that one. So, a little bit extra color. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thanks, again. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yep. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell, SunTrust. Please go ahead. Imron Shahzad Zafar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. This is actually Imron Zafar in for Bruce. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a couple questions about the TAVR business. Can you just talk about where you think you are in Europe vis-\u00e0-vis market share and where you think you can go in the next, call it, couple years in that geography? And then also, if you could just give any commentary around this litigation with Edwards on transcatheter valves in the U.S.. Thanks. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, on our Lotus program, as Dan outlined, we continue to invest a significant portion of our med device benefit in our Structural Heart franchise. In terms of share, we don't break out our share specifically in Europe. We are more limited versus some of our peers in terms of number of countries we're selling into. So, we're waiting to get reimbursement still for France. So, that's a large market that will open up for us in the future. But we continue to grow above market in the markets that we're serving, particularly in Germany. And the physician feedback continues be very strong on the low PVL rates which we believe are best-in-class and really the control and fully achievable and repositional capabilities of the platform. So, we continue to invest and we're excited about the enhancements of our depth guard technology that I mentioned in the prepared comments. Keith, any additional comments you want to mention on Lotus? Keith D. Dawkins - Global Chief Medical Officer & Executive VP : Yes. So, we've got a pretty rich number of presentations, the EuroPCR next month on Lotus; late-breaking trial on 1,000 patients from the response study, bicuspid valve subgroup from the response study, subclavian approach from the response study, a Lotus symposium, and on the stent side the EVOLVE first human-use five years data for the first time. And then, obviously, as we said at ACC, coincident with London Valves later this year, we're anticipating launching LOTUS EDGE which has a number of features including 14 French compatibility, more simple implantation procedure, more flexible device, and the depth guide technology which reduces the amount that the valve dips into the left ventricular outflow tract during deployment. So we have a lot going on with Lotus and then the additional sizes of 21 and 29 millimeter. And we've completed, as Mike said in his statement earlier, the REPRISE Japan study which is important. Imron Shahzad Zafar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And can you just give any color on the litigation with Edwards? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Yeah. We're not going to comment on our pending legal matters. Imron Shahzad Zafar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yep. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Vijay Kumar, Evercore. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Hey, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. So maybe, the first question I had was maybe a housekeeping question on a \u2013 you mentioned ICD declines and double-digit growth in stents. Was that in both geographies? When you say stents up double-digits, was that double-digit in both geographies, U.S., o-U.S.? And similarly on ICDs, I'm just wondering whether declines was only in the U.S. or did you see declines in o-U.S.? Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, Dan, do you want to comment on that one? Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Vijay, thanks for the question. We're not going to get too specific in terms of the growth rates by geography. Obviously, we think of Japan, we had approval for SYNERGY early in the quarter, so we're off and running there. We're on offense there. We had SYNERGY in the middle of the fourth quarter in the U.S., so strong growth there in stents. And Europe which has had SYNERGY for a long time is still doing very well. So, no, I don't want to quote specific numbers for each of the regions there. And I think, overall, I think Mike's commentary around CRM was pretty detailed, that if you think of \u2013 we're doing very well in Japan. We're doing well in Europe. And the CRM softness has been more of a U.S. product gap issue and we've hopefully solved a couple of those product gaps with the recent Quad approval and with the MRI safe brady approval. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Understood. And I just had one follow-up, Dan. When you think about the longer-term operating margin rate, I know you guys have laid out the 25% margin targets for 2017. Can you just talk about the leverage and your confidence in bending the SG&A line? Because it feels like just looking at the trends, the 25% might be \u2013 there's upside to that 25% number for 2017. And then any comments beyond 2017? Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. We've stated publicly before that by 2020 we believe we'd be at 27% to 28% operating margin, just at operating margin as a company, and the 25.1% is a great start to the year. But as I mentioned, the average for the year should be between 24% and 24.5%. And as always, we seek to strike that balance between delivering the adjusted operating margin and ensuring that durable consistent revenue growth for the long term. And if you look at our numbers this year, if you look at 6% to 8% organic revenue growth, 190 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion at the midpoint of the range and adjusted EPS growth of 14% at the low and 18% at the high end, I think we're effectively achieving that objective. And as you look at 2017 and beyond, we look to continue to deliver high performance and that's the goal. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Josh Jennings, Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thanks a lot. Wanted to hopefully start off with a question for Dan and just a follow-up on the operating margin discussion and some of the strength you saw in Q1 and particularly in the guidance. Can you talk about AMS integration and is AMS contributing already to operating margin? And how do you see the AMS contribution going through the year and also as it flows down into the bottom line in the accretion levels that you guys had guided to historically? Are you still on track there? Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I think the short answer to that Josh is that we are right on track. So we had talked about $0.03 accretion in the year from AMS. We're on track to achieve that. And then next year, we had talked about $0.07 and we should be on track for that. And the difference is really some of the integration costs that we have this year with respect to the quality remediation and some of the things like IT and such that are pushing that down a bit this year. And next year, you should see the full power of what AMS can bring to the margin story for the company. Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, Mike, I was hoping to just follow up on the CRM business. Clearly you have some nice approvals over the last month and particularly this week on the MRI, filling that MRI-safe product gap on the low-voltage side, and you initiated your MRI-safe trial for high voltage. I just wanted to get your level of confidence, your team's level of confidence in the timelines there. And maybe just help us think about the steps going forward in terms of times of enrollment and during the enrollment period and follow-up period just to help us think about the safety of that mid-2017 timeline on the high voltage side. Thanks a lot. Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yep. Sure. We feel comfortable with it. I think we've been reasonably accurate on the forecast for some of these big product approvals with the Quad and the MRI pacer. So, we're looking at call it mid-2017, maybe to hedge that a bit, third quarter 2017 for approval of our tachy MRI product. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Roxanne, let's take one more. Operator : Right. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic, UBS. Please go ahead. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, Vic, I'm on. Hi. Thanks for taking our question. So, a couple, if I could. One on WATCHMAN, just a follow-up on some of the questions that have already been asked. But what we hear, I guess, from centers, obviously NCD in place and differentiated device. And I think everyone's excited to see how this rolls out. But there is some question, I guess, about how profitable this is to some of these centers. For some, it does seem to be a little bit on the tight side for pricing net of reimbursement, but at the same time doesn't seem to be, from what we can tell, a significant impediment to interest or early adoption. So, any thoughts on how you see that playing out over time or regionally playing out as it begins to pick up steam here? And then I have one follow-up for Dan. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. So the NCD was a nice win for us. And we believe we really have the right sweet spot in terms of the WATCHMAN pricing. It is financially viable at most of the heart centers that we have contracted with. So, we stay very close to that, and it's really part of our category leadership strategy. So, we want to price it at the appropriate level given the investment that we've made in the platform, as well as future clinical trials that we're supporting as we advance this new therapy. But we do believe it's financially viable and a healthy product with appropriate margins for the vast majority of our hospital that are using this today. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful color. And then for Dan, on some of the work you're doing to drive manufacturing efficiencies and working capital efficiencies, net operating asset turnover here, obviously a key driver for ROIC and you do have an opportunity there from what we can tell. It's obviously a focus. Wondering if you could sketch out how we should see that begin to play out because understanding your manufacturing rationalization or the efforts you have underway, it may not be apparent from the numbers, on a turnover basis, the improvements that you're making. But would love to get a sense of when that'll start to become apparent and maybe start having an additional impact on returns on capital. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. I think I'd like to believe you'll see some of that impact this year. So, we have a significant emphasis on reducing inventory, and I had mentioned that in some of my prepared remarks, and trying to prove that, from our perspective, we can grow sales at the rate they we're doing but also optimize inventory. And we have a lot of work ongoing to try and do some things to rationalize that. And from a cash flow as well as the other metrics that you mentioned, reduce inventory overall by the end of the year as a company. So, my goal would be that as we go through the year, you'd see that. It was pretty reasonable compared to Q4 of last year, inventory this year. And so we've stemmed the tide a bit now and I'd look to, for the last three quarters, to see that reduce which will help all of the turnover and asset metrics as well as the contribution of working capital to cash flow. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Excellent. Thanks so much. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : All right. With that, we'd like to conclude the call. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and before you disconnect, Roxanne will give all the pertinent details for the replay. Thank you.

Welcome to the Second Quarter 2016 Boston Scientific Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session; instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Susie Lisa. Please go ahead. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q2 2016 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights of Q2 2016, Dan will review the financials for the quarter and then Q3 2016 and full-year 2016 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Keith Dawkins and Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, organic revenue growth is defined as excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from the acquisition of the American Medical Systems, AMS, Male Urology portfolio over the prior-year period. Also of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate, and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance including sales, margins, earnings and other Q2 2016 results and Q3 and full-year 2016 guidance as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike? Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Susie, and good morning, everyone. We continue to beat our long-range strategic plan goals and execute very well as a global team. The success of our category leadership strategy is helping us gain share in our core markets, expand into faster growth adjacencies and deliver solutions that address unmet clinical needs. Our consistent results continue to demonstrate that Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to deliver differentiated long-term shareholder value. With long-term visibility and mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, complemented by ongoing operating margin improvement initiatives, our goal is to consistently drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth. We're very excited about our excellent second quarter performance, first half results and most importantly our plans for the future. In Q2 we drove total operational revenue growth of 16% and organic revenue growth of 10%, excluding the impact of the AMS Urology acquisition. We had strong results across all regions, and five of our seven business units grew revenue double-digits organically. We've leveraged that revenue growth to drive adjusted operating income growth of 22%, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 23.4%, a 130 basis point improvement year-over-year. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.27, achieving the high end of guidance and representing 25% growth, including a negative $0.015 impact from foreign currency. So given our strong performance, we're increasing our 2016 guidance for revenue and adjusted EPS. We're increasing our full year organic revenue growth guidance from 6% to 8% to 8% to 9%. Full year operational revenue growth guidance, which includes the benefit of AMS, is increased from 9% to 11% to 11% to 12%. We're maintaining our full-year adjusted operating margin guidance of 24% to 24.5%, which at the midpoint is roughly 200 basis points of improvement over 2015. We're also increasing our adjusted EPS guidance by a penny over our prior range to $1.07 to $1.11, which represents 15% to 19% growth. Importantly, this adjusted EPS guidance includes an expected $0.05 negative impact from foreign exchange. I'll now provide some highlights on Q2 results and our 2016 outlook. In my remarks all references to growth are on a constant currency, organic, year-over-year basis and they exclude the benefit of AMS. Our second quarter revenue growth of 10% was broad-based across businesses and regions, led again by exciting new product launches, continued global expansion, and execution of our category leadership strategy. We drove double-digit growth in five businesses : Endo, Urology Public Health, Neuromodulation, Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions. In addition, each region accelerated sequentially. The U.S. grew 8%. Europe grew 9%. Asia Pac delivered 16% growth with every major country in the Asia Pac region up double digits this quarter. Emerging markets also continued to deliver as sales grew 20%, including China revenue at 21%. Our MedSurg businesses, Endo, Urology Public Health, and Neuromodulation continued to be a priority focus area for the company and each of the businesses maintained or accelerated growth from first quarter. These three businesses represent 40% of our operating income in the second quarter and they delivered adjusted operating margin of 32.8%. This is up 20 basis points sequentially and 240 basis points year-over-year. Our global Endoscopy team continues to perform at a high level, with revenue growing 11% in the second quarter. We continue to see strong growth in our core Endo business, supported by our innovative portfolio and broad-based global expansion initiatives. Key Endo growth drivers include the single use SpyGlass DS visualization system, the AXIOS stent for drainage of pancreatic fluid and our next generation hemostasis clip, the Resolution 360. High-single-digit growth in U.S. Endo was complemented by double-digit growth in every region outside the U.S. As we continue to develop commercial and physician training capabilities in emerging markets and add focus in pulmonary, which helped drive 25% growth in BT, Bronchial Thermoplasty led by the U.S., Japan and China. In Urology and Public Health our investments to become the clear market leader and category leader are being rewarded as growth, excluding AMS, accelerated to 18%. The business performed at a high level across the various regions and segments, including Kidney Stones, BPH, ED and Surg-Gyn. Our global commercial footprint and focus on physician education has helped us to convert a meaningful portion of the market opportunity created by Astora's exit of the market at the end of March. AMS sales strengthened the quarter and importantly remediation and integration efforts remain on track. An exciting new growth platform in our Urology business is the launch of the LithoVue platform. LithoVue is an innovative single-use digital scope for treatment of kidney stones that provide customers with enhanced visualization and navigation capabilities. LithoVue resonates with the physicians and hospitals due to less OR downtime for sterile processing of reusable scopes. Performance navigation characteristics that allow physicians to tackle tougher procedures and the ability to schedule a full day of procedures without the fear of cancellation due to reusable scopes being down. In Neuromodulation we continue to invest in the fast-growing microelectronics market where we enjoy innovation and supply chain leverage between our CRM and Neuromod business. Neuromodulation revenues grew in the quarter to 12% \u2013 grew 12%. Sales were driven by the U.S. market-leading Spectra platform, the launch of Precision Montage, which offers full-body MRI capability, and our Vercise deep brain stimulation platform. Our U.S. DBS trial continues to progress and we expect to launch in the U.S. in first quarter 2018. Additionally, earlier this week we announced the acquisition of Cosman Medical, a technology leader in the field of radio frequency ablation systems for the treatment of chronic pain. This acquisition broadens our Neuromodulation portfolio and is highly synergistic with our U.S. commercial team. We're excited to offer physicians treating patients with chronic pain another non-opioid therapeutic option earlier in the treatment continuum. Now turning to Cardiovascular, which includes our Peripheral and Interventional Cardiology businesses. Overall this segment grew sales 13% in the quarter and delivered adjusted operating margin of 32.2%, up more than 170 basis points year-over-year. Our Peripheral business delivered exceptional results with strong global sales across all regions, fueled by an innovative portfolio. Sales grew 14% on strong results across all regions and segments, including stents, thrombectomy and our emerging drug-eluting portfolio. We also delivered strong growth in Interventional Oncology, where the integration of Interventional Radiology business of CeloNova remains on track. In our Venous segment we continue to see very strong demand for our Zelante Deep Vein Thrombosis system. We're the only company developing leading drug-eluting technologies globally on multiple platforms in order to treat complex peripheral vascular disease. The Eluvia peripheral drug- eluting stent IDE trial called IMPERIAL is on track to complete enrollment by year end 2016. In Interventional Cardiology we're focused on gaining share in our core businesses while expanding in faster growth segments that leverage our capabilities. This strategy is working. In the second quarter, Interventional Cardiology grew 12%, led by Structural Heart, drug-eluting stents and PCI Guidance. SYNERGY had an excellent quarter as we grew DES sales 9%. SYNERGY is now the market-leading premium DES platform, and it's on track to represent 50% to 60% of our U.S. DES revenue mix by the end of 2016. PCI Guidance grew mid-teens on continued share gains in intravascular ultrasound, and we're encouraged by strong early feedback on the ease-of-use of our COMET Fractional Flow Reserve system. Our leading portfolio of solutions for complex, high-risk PCI patients also contributed to global growth. The 12% IC revenue growth was fueled by our strengthening in Structural Heart business, which includes our Lotus Transcatheter Aortic Valve and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure. We believe we are well positioned to drive long-term growth in these two fast-growing markets via our differentiated platforms and expanded capabilities. We also aim to deliver at the high end of our 2016 Structural Heart guidance range of $175 million to $200 million. Our Lotus valve continues to gain share in Europe, and we're investing significantly in clinical studies, R&D and our global supply chain to develop our capabilities further. We remain on track to launch Lotus Edge at PCR London Valves in September. The Lotus Edge delivery system features a 14-French expandable sheath called iSleeve, and is designed for more flexibility and simplified deployment. It also offers our new depth guard technology, which limits the depth of the valve in a left ventricular outflow tract. Lotus also offers best-in-class paravalvular leakage rates, and we aim to enhance Lotus with studies to demonstrate improved permanent pacemaker rates with Lotus Edge and depth guard. So our goal is to provide initial Lotus Edge data at PCR London Valves. We do expect a slight delay in our expanded Lotus valve matrix in Europe, with a 21-millimeter valve estimated CE Mark timing first quarter 2017 and a 29-millimeter valve in Europe in mid-2017. We continue to invest and plan for a U.S. launch with the Lotus Edge platform in late 2017. Also in Structural Heart, WATCHMAN sales were strong on procedure growth and new account openings. We are developing additional WATCHMAN capabilities in field clinical support, market development and physician training courses. Implant success rates and patient outcomes remain very high as evidenced by the 98.5% success rate in the EWOLUTION registry detailed at HRS in May. We continued to expand WATCHMAN into new markets, and we're pleased with the recent reimbursement approval and launch in France. Importantly, the unique clinical benefits of WATCHMAN are being rewarded, as evidenced by the French reimbursement at a meaningful premium to competitive LAAC devices. Post a limited market release of our next-generation WATCHMAN FLEX device, we have decided to pursue design enhancements before returning the next-gen platform to market. Importantly, we anticipate this delay will have no impact on our current WATCHMAN product, and thus no change to our market outlook for LAAC. Rhythm Management sales increased 5% in the quarter and delivered adjusted operating margin of 16.9%, up 200 basis points year-over-year, as improving profitability remains a core focus. In CRM we improved our global performance and delivered 4% growth in second quarter. Our European and Asia Pac CRM businesses continued to grow faster than the market, offset by slower growth in U.S. CRM. Pacemaker sales grew 15% globally, with excellent U.S. performance, fueled by our ACCOLADE MRI launch and growth from our X4 CRT-P Quad device. Worldwide ICD sales were flat as we delivered above-market growth internationally that was offset by weaker sales in the U.S. In the U.S. we faced some near-term headwinds due to a Tacky MRI product gap and replacement cycle headwinds. However, we recently earned FDA approval of our QE X4 Quad CRT lead and the early results are promising. Importantly, EMBLEM S-ICD is a key differentiator and growth continues to accelerate globally. We continue to expand global S-ICD utilization with more long-term data from the EFFORTLESS Registry, growing physician implant experience, geographic expansion and the recent second quarter 2016 EU launch of EMBLEM MRI, which contributed to our solid international growth. Due to a change in protocol of our U.S. ENABLE MRI clinical trial we are revising our goal for Transvenous Tacky MRI U.S. approval by year-end 2017, but continue to expect to gain MRI labeling for both new and previously implanted ICDs and CRT-Ds with the new timeline. The continued cadence of data proving the superiority of ENDURALIFE batteries and the pending FDA approval of EMBLEM MRI S-ICD, which is expected in third quarter, will help us offset the near-term headwinds from the U.S. MRI high voltage segment. In second quarter, European CRM sales grew 5%, representing nine straight quarters of above-market growth, giving us further confidence in our long term CRM outlook. Our EP business grew 6% in second quarter and we're encouraged by double-digit growth in Europe, led by new RHYTHMIA installs and the recent launches of IntellaNav OI and INTELLATIP MIFI OI ablation catheters. The U.S. launch in late first quarter of the Blazer OI catheter will be augmented in Q3 with the upcoming launch of the Nav-enabled version of this catheter. So to wrap up, our company delivered another excellent quarter. Our second quarter performance reflects the strength of our global team, the depth and breadth of our portfolio, our globalization efforts and our ongoing investments into faster growth markets. Importantly, we believe we are well positioned to deliver continued strong results in the second half of 2016 and beyond. I really want to thank our employees globally for their winning spirit and their strong commitment to Boston Scientific. Now let me turn the call over to Dan for a more detailed review of our financial results. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Mike. In Q2 we generated organic revenue growth of 10% versus our 6% to 8% guidance range and adjusted EPS of $0.27, representing 25% year-over-year growth and the high end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.27 cents. The strong adjusted EPS growth performance in Q2 was driven primarily by revenue growth upside and a lower SG&A rate versus prior year. And given the strong performance in the first half of 2016, we are again raising full year guidance for revenue growth and adjusted EPS. Consolidated revenue of $2.126 billion represented operational revenue growth of 16%, exceeding the high end of guidance and excludes the impact of a $24 million headwind from foreign exchange which was in line with guidance. Excluding an approximate 500 basis point contribution from the AMS Male Urology portfolio acquisition, organic revenue growth was 10% in the quarter and 15% on an as-reported basis. Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 70.7%, decreasing 60 basis points year-over-year and unfortunately 130 basis points below the midpoint of Q2 guidance due to a few factors that I will detail. The year-over-year decrease is due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, which was a 120 basis point headwind as well as costs related to our new Malaysia manufacturing plant, the AMS integration, including the AMS quality remediation expense. Compared to guidance, the shortfall is due to inventory charges in advance of new product launches, inventory write-offs related to WATCHMAN FLEX and more unfavorable FX. We now expect Q3 and full-year 2016 adjusted gross margin to be in the range of 71.5% to 72.5%, which includes an expected 75 to 100 basis points of unfavorable foreign exchange. A key element in the second half increase is lower expected inventory charges, and we will also benefit fully from the lower 2016 standard costs of our products as we will have sold through all of the inventory valued at last year's higher standards. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $763 million or 35.9% of sales in Q2, down 140 basis points year-over-year. We continue to believe our full-year rate will be between 35.5% and 36.5%, which at the midpoint would be a 140 basis point improvement compared to last year. Adjusted research and development expenses were $222 million in the second quarter, or 10.4% of sales, which is down 50 basis points year-over-year. As a result of a slightly lower R&D rate in the first half, we expect our full-year 2016 adjusted R&D rate to be between 10.5% and 11.5% of sales, or 50 basis points lower than prior guidance. Royalty expense was 0.9% of sales in Q2, roughly flat year-over-year. Our Q2 2016 adjusted operating margin of 23.4% was in line with our guidance and represents a 130 basis point improvement over Q2 last year, which marks the eighth consecutive quarter in which we will have expanded adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points or more. As a reminder, we've signaled a sequential decrease in adjusted operating margin from Q1's rate as we experience the usual increase in SG&A from Q1 to Q2 due to seasonal trade show activity and began to ramp re-investment of the medical device excise tax suspension. Our first-half 2016 adjusted operating margin of 24.2% positions us well to achieve our full-year adjusted operating margin guidance of 24% to 24.5%, and we remain on track to reach 25%-plus in 2017. Q2 adjusted operating income grew 22% year-over-year, with all three reportable segments expanding adjusted operating margin by at least 170 basis points over Q2 2015. Specific to Rhythm Management, the team delivered an adjusted operating margin of 16.9%, up 280 basis points year-over-year. In the second half of 2016, we expect Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to continue to improve and be 18% to 19%. This second half gain is expected to result from realizing the full benefit of 2016 product costs, leveraging the improved top-line performance expected of the global CRM and EP businesses, and we continue to believe Rhythm Management is on track to deliver an adjusted operating margin of 20% in 2017. Turning to the balance sheet, we had some key developments in the quarter that helped reduce future uncertainties. Before I get into the details of the activity in the quarter, let me try to frame out the next three years of expected cash flow at a high level. From 2017 through 2019, we believe we can generate cumulative adjusted free cash flow, after CapEx, approaching $6 billion. We expect to allocate roughly two-thirds of that $6 billion to a combination of M&A and share repurchases. As you are aware, the two most significant liabilities on our balance sheet are our IRS transfer pricing case and the mesh litigation. During the quarter, we took two important steps to manage these liabilities. First, we reached a stipulation of settled issues with the IRS for the 2001 to 2007 tax years. And importantly, this stipulation also provides a framework to settle the remaining years 2008 through 2015 as well. While there's work to do to conclude all the years, we are confident we will bring these to conclusion over the coming quarters. With a payment in 12 to 24 months, this would eliminate one of the most significant liabilities on our balance sheet. With regards to mesh, we increased our reserve by $608 million during the quarter. With the same goal of managing our liabilities, we've reached conditional or final settlements on 12,000 claims and made significant progress towards reaching agreement in principle on another 7,000 claims for a total of 19,000 claims. This represents approximately half of the roughly 40,000 known claims, and we expect to make even more progress during the remainder of 2016. As you know, every quarter we assess all four key components involving calculating the reserve and make any necessary adjustments for all probable and estimable charges, including the volume of known claims, the estimated cost to resolve each claim, an estimate of future claims and the cost to defend each claim. Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $2.375 billion as of June 30, 2016, and we believe it reflected our best estimate of what is probable and estimable. Of note as well is that included in this reserve is the Mirowski judgment which we have paid in full subsequent to quarter end. So as of today, the reserve would be closer to $2 billion. As a reminder, this $2 billion includes a number of claims we have agreed in principle to settle, but have not yet paid. Once those settlements are funded, the amount of the reserve will be adjusted accordingly. Now I'll move on to interest expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $59 million, compared to $106 million in Q2 of last year. The decrease is primarily due to the pre-tax one-time charge of approximately $45 million associated with the senior note refinancing in Q2 of last year. Excluding this charge, Q2 2016 interest expense was $61 million. Our average interest expense rate was 4% in Q2 this year, compared to 8% in Q2 last year. The lower interest rate expense in Q2 of 2016 was primarily due to lower average cost of debt resulting from the senior notes refinancing and the inclusion of the pre-tax one-time charge in Q2 of last year that I mentioned. Excluding this charge, Q2 2015 interest expense would have been 4.6%. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 47.8% on a reported basis and 14.2% on an adjusted basis. As reported last week, we're pleased with the conditional settlement reached with the IRS counsel regarding our transfer pricing litigation and plan to use some of the current benefit to repatriate overseas cash, thus we continue to expect our full-year 2016 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 14%. We believe this IRS settlement, in addition to recent progress we've made towards reaching agreements in principle to settle additional mesh claims as I mentioned, are prudent actions to take in the management of our balance sheet. Finally, Q2 2016 adjusted EPS of $0.27 includes approximately $0.015 of unfavorable FX and represents 25% year-over-year growth or 32% growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, Q2 2016 EPS was a loss of $0.15 and includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $580 million after tax. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $464 million, compared to $406 million in Q2 of last year. Given the strong adjusted free cash flow generation in the first half of this year, we are raising our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance from $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, which was formerly our stretch goal. Achieving adjusted free cash flow of $1.6 billion would represent 17% growth, and we continue to pursue inventory management initiatives designed to improve the working capital contribution to cash flow. In Q2 we used cash primarily to repay $250 million of bank term loans as well as fund the previously agreed legal settlements. As of June 30, 2016, we had cash on hand of $438 million. Near-term, our capital allocation priorities are to manage contingencies and pursue tuck-in M&A. We ended Q2 with 1.375 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our share count to increase by roughly 5 million per quarter through the end of 2016 as we plan to keep the buyback suspended for the balance of this year. We expect this to result in a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.380 billion shares for full-year 2016. I'll now walk through guidance for Q3 and full-year 2016. For the full year we now expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $8.270 billion to $8.370 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 8% to 9% on an organic basis and 11% to 12% on both an operational and reported basis. As a result of a stronger dollar, at current rates we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $70 million for the full-year 2016. Turning to adjusted EPS, we now expect full-year 2016 adjusted EPS to be in a range of $1.07 to $1.11, representing 15% to 19% adjusted earnings growth. Our previous guidance assumed the unfavorable FX on full-year adjusted EPS would be between $0.05 and $0.06. Given the fact that Q2 saw slightly less unfavorable impact than expected, we now believe the full year impact will be closer to $0.05, which assumes $0.02 to $0.03 in the second half of this year. On a GAAP basis we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.30 to $0.35. Now turning to Q3 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $2.35 billion to $2.85 billion. This represents year-over-year growth in a range of 7% to 9% organically and 8% to 10% operationally. We expect the foreign exchange headwind on Q3 revenue to be negligible. For the third quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.25 to $0.27 per share, and GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.13 to $0.15 per share. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q2 2016 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q2 results as well as Q3 and full-year 2016 guidance including P&L line item guidance. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Susie who will moderate the Q&A. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks Dan. Greg, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one quick follow-up. Greg, please go ahead. Operator : Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes, good morning. First off, can you hear me okay? Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey. Good morning, Mike. Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hear you fine, Mike. Thanks. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Well, first off, fantastic quarter, obviously, so congratulations. Let me just clarify just on a few items. So number one, the pacemaker performance being as strong as it is on the back of the MRI launch, one question I've already gotten from people, is that a clean number? Is there any stocking in that number that we should be aware of? Second, the move in the Structural Heart guidance to the high end of the range, is that WATCHMAN more than Lotus? If you could kind of share any insights into that? And then I'll follow up. Thanks. Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Good morning, Mike. On the pacemaker, our team has been waiting for a long time for that product approval. We've had some slow quarters in our pacemaker business in the U.S. Outside the U.S. has done quite well with that product for a while, so that's not a stocking number. We were ready for that launch for quite a while. And the team, our commercial teams did an excellent job executing it. So we think it's a very innovative product and long in coming. And the U.S. team essentially did what the OUS teams have done with that product for a while. And Structural Heart, we continue to be really excited about the future for Structural Heart. It continues to be our largest investment area as a company. We're comfortable with the high end of our guidance that we provided at $175 million to $200 million. We continued to invest long-term in R&D capabilities, clinical capabilities and commercial capabilities to prepare ourselves for the launch in the U.S. And we're really excited about the upcoming data that we expect to see in London Valves on our pacemaker rate with the addition of Lotus Edge and depth guard. So it's really an important category for us. As you know we continue to \u2013 we outlined at Investor Day back in I think 2013 and 2015 our focus to continue to grow in our core businesses and take share, which we're doing, and importantly expand into faster growth markets. And that's exactly what you're seeing as a company. And our Structural Heart investment really is kind of leading the pack there. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So Mike, I apologize, the question was within Structural Heart, WATCHMAN is what's driving to the high end of the range there? Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : What's driving the high end of the range there is we're just -continue to open up new accounts. We continue to improve our account utilization. And we continue to build up our commercial capabilities in the U.S. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. The gross margin kind of issues in the quarter, I think that you did a good job of, Dan, walking through what those are. So if we look at the back half of the year and expect an improvement in the gross margin, that's because, one, your inventory issues from the AMS transaction basically you get to a better, safer cost on those products, and then the FX headwind that you saw this quarter on the gross margin should dissipate, is that accurate? Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, somewhat. Let me just make sure we're clear on that. So we're at 70.7% in the quarter. The guidance range for Q3 and the full year is 71.5% to 72.5%. So it implies the uptick that you mentioned in the second half. I think the two key drivers of that are the inventory charges for the CRM products related to the better uptake of MRI-safe brady and quad in the U.S. as well as the WATCHMAN FLEX. We don't believe that those repeat themselves. And then secondly, we will get the full benefit in the second half of the lower manufacturing costs that we have for 2016 standards because we'll now be selling all the inventory at the new standards, and we will have sold off all the inventory at last year's standards. Those are the two main drivers that put us back into the 71.5% to 72.5% range. FX, we actually assume, is probably somewhat in the same range as where it was in Q2. That's really the reason, if you think back to last quarter, our guidance for FX in gross margin would have implied about 70 to 75 basis points each quarter for Qs 2, 3, and 4. Now it's 120; so that's a 50 basis point difference. And that's the reason why the guidance for the full year came from 72% to 73% to 71.5% to 72.5%. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. All right. I have a long list of questions, but I'll let some others jump in. Thank you. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David R. Lewis - Aurelian Resources, Inc.: Good morning. In light of a very strong revenue quarter, guys, I hate to ask something as banal as cash flow, Dan, but you don't give us multi-year cash flow estimates that often and I noticed that your $6 billion free cash estimate in the next three years is 10% higher than what we were looking for. Can you just sort of walk us through kind of why that would be and some of the components? I imagine one component's CapEx and perhaps the other is margins. But our margins numbers are pretty high and you're still 10% above us. So what could be driving that significant upside? Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think you answered your own question there, David, a bit. It's margins and CapEx. So one of the things that we have this year is, as we detailed in our guidance at the beginning of the year, is a CapEx number at $350 million that's $100 million higher than we think we need to effectively run each year. So we get that back, hopefully, each of the next three years and then expanding margins. So our goal next year is 25%-plus. And as we've given guidance for or long-term goals for 27% to 28% by 2020, the combination of those two factors and the CapEx I think gets you a long way there. And then the other piece is that we're going to continue to try, from a working capital perspective, to make that be our friend. We have a lot of inventory initiatives in place to really hopefully lead the industry in that regard and be best-in-class. And when we do that, that'll turn something that's going to drag on cash flow into a positive and hopefully see the beginnings of that this year. You see that from us taking our guidance from 1.5 billion to 1.6 billion; a piece of that is the inventory initiatives. David R. Lewis - Aurelian Resources, Inc.: Okay. Very helpful. And then, Mike, maybe a couple of product questions. I guess the first is just sort of the forgotten biz for Boston MedSurg is sort of no longer forgotten given the organic growth. And specifically, Endoscopy has gone from mid-single growth last year to double-digit growth this year. I wonder if you could just give us a sense of sort of where we are in the product cycles. Is it share gain from competitors? Is it product cycles that is driving that? And then secondarily, on DES on SYNERGY, where do you think we are in sort of share versus mix? And obviously you're growing dramatically ahead of market. So what are some of the factors that are driving that? And I'll jump back in queue. Thanks. Great quarter. Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, David. Yeah. We've definitely never forgotten about Endo. It's really an incredibly high-performing business and it has been for a number of years. And they really have just continued to grow and expand. So our Endo business enjoys a, first of all, a strong market; a bit fewer competitors in our Endoscopy markets than some of our others. It has very strong growth profile in terms of the market growth and OUS expansion. And we are a very strong category leader across the globe, and we continue to expand particularly in the emerging markets. The portfolio is really driving a lot of the launch, a lot of the success that you've seen in 2016, led by our SpyGlass digital DS platform, which is driving solid double-digit growth and helps pull through the core portfolio. We also launched a product called the AXIOS Stent which is doing very well, as well as a hemostasis clip. So the portfolio cadence for Endo is very strong. It's very well led. It's very globally oriented. And they also do a great job of laying out the economic value proposition for hospitals beyond the portfolio. So they continue to perform very well and intentionally somewhere in my comments with Mike in his first question, we're intentionally focusing on investing greater in faster growth markets and faster growth businesses. And they represent 40% of our operating income, the MedSurg sector does now for BSC, so more to come there. DES is doing excellent. And we had a few critics early on in our launch, saying we weren't being aggressive enough. We signaled all along that we're going to be \u2013 drive an appropriate premium price for this product because we believe it is the best product available in the marketplace and the data is proving that out. And maybe Keith can comment in a minute. So we believe it's the premium product. We do offer a premium price for it, and so we've been smart in our rollout of it. And I think physicians and customers have seen the value of the ease-of-use and the clinical data of SYNERGY. And we expect the U.S. penetration to be probably above 50%, closer to 50% to 60% in the U.S. in 2016, and we continue to roll it out globally. So the team's doing a nice job there. But again, it's part of the overall story in Interventional Cardiology. Again, pointing to faster growth segments, our DES doing well, a lot of investments in complex coronary and imaging, which are part of the portfolio, and clearly our Structural Heart. So Kevin Ballinger and the team are doing a nice job. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Keith. Keith D. Dawkins - Global Chief Medical Officer & Executive VP : Yes, David. I think the SYNERGY stent operators around the world are appreciating the best-in-class acute performance because obviously if you can't deliver the stent, that's really the end of the discussion. And we have a lot of data now, including the EVOLVE II pivotal data, the EVOLVE (39:35) five-year data, and the real-world scar (39:40) data from Europe confirming the safety. Everybody, both patients and physicians, are interested in stent thrombosis. And the stent thrombosis, as you know from the data, is very low. We have 20,000 patients in investigative sponsored trials with SYNERGY, and these trials are beginning to release their data. And you'll see more flows of data at the meetings during the rest of this year and next year. David R. Lewis - Aurelian Resources, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, David. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a really strong quarter. So, Dan, you raised the organic growth from 6% to 8% to 8% to 9%, but you only raise the EPS guidance by a penny. And so can you talk about why you're not getting better leverage on the incremental revenue? You kept the operating margin guidance the same. And then I had one follow-up. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, Larry. I think probably the best way to explain that just to do a quick summary of the increase in revenue. So the revenue is $170 million higher at the midpoint of guidance and that breaks down into three things : $20 million comes from FX; $75 million comes from revenue that already came in Q2; and then $75 million comes in the second half. I think the main factor that's offsetting that is if you look at our R&D rate, our R&D rate in the first half was 10.5%. And looking at the second half it's going to be 11.5% to get to the full-year rate of 11%. So that's 100 basis point increase in R&D, largely related to timing and the investments in the Structural Heart that Mike had mentioned. So that, for the most part, offsets the additional flow-through in the revenue that you get \u2013 the additional $75 million of revenue you get in the second half... Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it \u2013 sorry. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And then we're also \u2013 just as you look at it still very pleased to be at 15% to 19% full-year EPS growth which would be four years straight of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it. Sorry to interrupt there. And then for my follow-up, at the 2015 analyst meeting, the organic revenue goal was 3% to 6% in 2016 and 2017. You're now guiding to 8% to 9% in 2016. How should we think about the sustainability of the 8% to 9% and your goals in 2017 and beyond? And I recognize you're not giving guidance here, but you're way outperforming what you expected to do at your analyst meeting last year. Thanks for taking my questions. Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Thank you. The team is outperforming as part of the high performance culture that we have as a company. We're very excited about the full-year guidance, 8% to 9%. As you said, it compares to 3% to 6% we laid out, so it's a pretty strong beat there, and strong momentum across really each region and each business. So, we're not going to provide any outlook into 2017. Clearly outperforming the market at this level is not likely sustainable each year. But that being said, we're constantly looking to outperform the market. We're investing in faster growth businesses, and we're very confident in our ability long-term to drive mid-single-digit revenue growth, improve margins and drive double-digit EPS growth. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Larry. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thanks. Can you hear me okay? Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Hear you fine, Bob. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Good morning. So obviously, you've got the best revenue growth here for Boston Scientific essentially since the financial crisis, a higher absolute level of revenues than I think any of us thought, so congratulations on the unbelievable progress. I guess my first question is really kind of philosophical in terms of the long-term now that you've got this sort of higher level revenues and higher level of revenue growth. You guys have given some long-term guidance on operating margin targets and goals. So now that you're kind of outperforming on revenues, what's the thought on those operating margin targets? Is the thought that you'll take an opportunity to spend more and continue to sort of keep those operating margin targets? Or is it more likely that with this higher level of growth that you could be towards the high end or higher of the long-term targets that you've set previously? Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Bob. Yeah, I don't think we'll be changing the trajectory in terms of the margin guidance we've given. As we always say, it's about striking a balance between delivering durable, consistent revenue growth and expanding operating margins. And if you look at the numbers and see what we've done for the last three years relative to revenue growth and particularly on the margin expansion front, looking at 27% to 28% adjusted operating margin by 2020, and a consistent durable growing top line through that period and the goal of double-digit adjusted EPS growth each of those years, I think we're going to stick with that as our targets. Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : No, I understand you're sticking with the targets, but I'm just trying to understand philosophically because you're outperforming so nicely here, is the bias more towards opportunities to invest more? Or let some of that through? Because again, these levels are just so much higher than we originally thought. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Again, it's striking a balance. We do have a lot of investment, as Mike mentioned, relative to Structural Heart. That's a lot of investment to get to the U.S. market and be successful there. And I think we're \u2013 it's always about striking that balance. Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. And I think also we'll do an Investor Day 2017. We haven't nailed down yet. But we're making significant investments in platforms and markets that will have a big impact on the growth rate of the business in 2018, 2019 and 2020. And so you look at our launch in the U.S. of TAVR, our launch in the U.S. in the future of a deep brain stimulation, launching \u2013 only one that will have a drug-eluting stent and a drug-coated balloon for peripheral vascular, and we continue to expand into pulmonary and other areas across the company. So we definitely are investing for long-term growth, and a lot of it is big clinical investments in R&D that will impact the company, particularly in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And then on Structural Heart just real quickly, what was the driver of you guys providing guidance? It'll be at the high end of the range, is that Lotus or WATCHMAN or both? Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It's both. Both are doing quite well. Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brooks West from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Good morning. Can you hear me? Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I hear you fine, Brooks. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Great. Thanks, guys. Just to put a cap on the gross margin discussion, so, Dan, those all seem like transient issues with the inventory. And I'm not trying to push for guidance for next year, but as I look at my model we've got you at about 73% gross margins for 2017. I don't see anything that I really need to flow-through into 2017 from this. Is that the correct way to think about it? I mean, you're a little bit lower for 2016, but in terms of thinking about the forward model that should resolve itself and we should kind of go back to where we thought we were going. Correct? Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't talk specifically about a rate for 2017. Obviously, the goal is to continuously increase the gross margin rate. And it'll be part of what we believe is 25%-plus adjusted operating margin for next year, so with that as the goal. The FX in the back half is really the only thing that we believe is consistent from the Q2 performance. The other things I mentioned relative to inventory charges and the benefit from the standards, hopefully, to your point, is a transient thing. So the FX is the only one that continues into the second half. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Okay. Perfect. And then maybe kind of piggybacking on Bob's question, but also thinking about some of the questions around MedSurg. You kind of conditioned us, in terms of the long-term operating margin progression, to think about Rhythm Management. And obviously, you're making great progress there. But given the growth we're seeing in MedSurg and Interventional Cardiology, it seems like that equation maybe needs to change a little bit. And if we allocate a little bit more of the strength in MedSurg to that equation, it seems like we push up to and through those targets maybe more quickly than if we were just relying on Rhythm Management. Is that also a fair kind of way to look at your business? Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I think the focus on Rhythm Management has really just been because of where they were, right. Starting off in the high single-digits, it's gotten a lot of focus over the last three or four years. I think we've made \u2013 Joe and the team have made tremendous progress getting it to the 16.9% that it is in Q2, the 18% to 19% that it'll be the second half of this year, and then ultimately the 20% next year and beyond that in 2018 and beyond. All the while, to you point, MedSurg and Cardiovascular have continued to grow their margins as well. So I think it goes back to what Mike said to the answer to the last question which is there's investments that we're making to ensure that durable growth 2018, 2019, 2020 and beyond and it's not just one business that has that investment. We're investing in all of the businesses. So we spend a lot of time looking at each of the individual segments and the profitability there, and the math adds up to what we've given for our goals. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Perfect. And if I could sneak in just one product question, I'm wondering if Mirviss [Jeffrey] has decided whether to bring a drug-coated balloon to the U.S. or not? Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, we'll likely be providing additional insights on our clinical strategy with our balloon at the next quarterly call. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Perfect. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel. Please go ahead. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Maybe let me start off with Lotus. Mike, you talked about gaining EU share in the quarter. Maybe give us a little more color on that, are you ready to quantify that at all? You've talked about penetration or share of greater than 30% in your selected accounts. And maybe just add some more color on the Edge launch coming up in September. Is this a share gainer? Or no, that's going to require more time and those additional sizes that are coming in the first half of 2017? Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Sure. Again, the big investment for us in Structural Heart with WATCHMAN and TAVR, and you know, we're planning for the long-term here, particularly with our TAVR, given the market growth profile and how large the market is. And our view that we have a very differentiated platform from the other market contenders, given the controlled release of our Lotus valve and the lowest paravalvular leakage rates. So we think we truly have a differentiated platform in a very large market. We're a bit hamstrung in the near-term in Europe without having all five sizes. We have three of them today. So that hurts us a bit, but we'll solve that with a 21-millimeter in first quarter 2017 and eventually the largest size at probably first half 2017. So that will help. So in the meantime, we continue to do very well with the three valve sizes that we have. We won't provide any additional guidance in terms of number of accounts or penetration, but clearly it is a share taking strategy. The market's already large. The market's growing, and we're quite confident that we're currently the strong number three player. But that's not going to be our aspiration over the years, particularly as we launch Lotus Edge and depth guard. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Turning to a bigger picture question, Dan obviously is emphasizing the growth in free cash flow this year, the $6 billion number you threw out over the next few years. You're also saying, Dan, that, I think correctly that with the settling or going a long way toward settling the IRS agreements a major uncertainty is off the table. I mean, all that suggests to me that that might give you more flexibility in thinking about M&A or portfolio additions. You just announced Cosman. How are you thinking about this, Mike and Dan? And should we be thinking that there is more possibility for M&A as a result? Any color would be appreciated. Thank you. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, Rick. Yeah. I'll hit it from a financial perspective; maybe Mike can jump in on the strategic side. The goal \u2013 and I think you've framed it out very well, that's our goal is to eliminate the uncertainties that we have on the balance sheet. I think we've taken a lot of good steps in the quarter to do that. And that's going to give us more financial flexibility in the future. And that's the goal. So we should hopefully free up more of that cash flow for the long-term. We gave you the numbers hopefully as goals for the next three years. And the goal is to have as much of that available to fuel the business from an M&A and share repurchase perspective. So I don't know if anything specific, but yeah, I mean, that's really the goal is to eliminate the uncertainties and give us as much financial flexibility as we can have. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from Barclays. Please go ahead. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. So I guess the first question that wanted to clarify when you talked about MRI-safe timelines, could you just inform us what revising the goal for Tacky MRI timeline, entail what the change was there, and then S-ICDs still on track. Can you talk about how that's doing and how you expect MRI-safe approval to potentially improve sales for S-ICD? Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Absolutely. We'll ask Dr. Stein to comment on this question. Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President : Yeah, Matt. I mean on the MRI, not going to get into any of the details of the change in the protocol. But in the course of conduct of our ENABLE MRI trial, we have made a decision that we do need to revise the protocol with respect to patient screening and eligibility. And that's just the process of getting that protocol or vision through is what's going to cause the push in the timeline. Still have a goal of getting that approved by the end of 2017. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. And on S-ICD? Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President : I'm sorry. Could you clarify the question on S-ICD? Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. I was just curious. I may have missed the comment here because the comments went by kind of fast. But do you still have the same timeline for S-ICD MRI approval? And just how is S-ICD performing today? Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President : Yeah. We still have the same timeline, anticipating approval Q3 of this year. And really couldn't be more pleased with what we've seen in terms of uptake of the EMBLEM MRI where it's been launched in Europe and the existing EMBLEM device in the U.S. and globally. Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We expect EMBLEM MRI approval in the U.S. in third quarter. Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President : Q3 this year. Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. And could you just talk about broader utilization? Obviously, your results were phenomenal this quarter. Are you seeing something going on in either the U.S. market or some of the emerging markets that you play in that's contributing to higher levels of utilization that may not continue going forward? Or do you think that you're really just outperforming your markets from good execution? Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thanks, Matt. It's Mike. I also don't want to be a broken record here, but I think I want to just reinforce, consistent with our Investor Day presentations in 2013 and 2015, we've continued to invest our portfolio into faster growth markets. So, kind of in the maybe 2011 timeframe, we called our market growth profile about 3% in the markets we compete in. So as we've shifted our portfolio over time into faster growth markets, we think the markets we compete in now are kind of in the 4% to 5% growth range, if you look at the composite of BSC. So we are pleased that we're outperforming the market, but we'll strive to continue to do so. But we think that we have fundamentally shifted the markets that we play in to about a 4% to 5% growth market versus maybe a 2% to 3% growth market 4 or 5 years ago. So the markets are stronger that we compete in and the team is doing a really nice job of outperforming. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks for the thought. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Greg, we'll take one more question please. Operator : Okay. That question comes from the line of Glenn Navarro from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Two questions. One, drug-eluting stents in the quarter up high-single digits, significantly outpacing the market. You have Abbott launching Absorb. So my question is, is this high-single digits sustainable, given Absorb coming into the market? Or should we anticipate a little moderation going forward? And then I had a quick follow-up. Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, yeah. We're not giving DES guidance for the third quarter or fourth quarter. We're going to continue to run the play, which is we believe we have the best product in the market, and Keith can comment a bit more on the clinical data. And we've been competing with Absorb in Europe for quite a while. We would put it at probably less than a 7% \u2013 the BVS probably less than 7% of the global market and it's been on the market for quite a while. So we feel like we're in the position of strength in terms of our product portfolio, and we continue to look at BVS, it's an interesting technology. And we've got a number of bets and it's a fact (57:58) in the future we can look at a second-gen or a third generation device then we'll eventually bring that to market but at this time we believe that SYNERGY is the premium device and we'll continue to focus on driving that. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then with Keith on the line, I'd love to get his thoughts on kind of SYNERGY versus Absorb. And then my follow-up result was on Eluvia which was just launched in Europe and the data is very strong. And once you come to the U.S. you'll be by far \u2013 you'll be the second DES on the market for peripherals but with by far the best data. So how is Eluvia doing in Europe? And it just seems like this is one product that has a significant opportunity that's flying under the radar screen so just thoughts on Eluvia as well. Thanks. Keith D. Dawkins - Global Chief Medical Officer & Executive VP : And so, Glenn, in terms of SYNERGY and BVS, obviously there's not a lot of head-to-head data between the two, but BVS has been available in Europe. It's had CE Mark for five-and-a-half years and the penetration, as Mike said, is mid-single digits. And you and everybody else on the call is well aware of the Absorb II and Absorb III data. The safety profile of drug-eluting stents is paramount. Safety profile is more important than efficacy. And with a stent thrombosis rate that is at least 2x SYNERGY, we feel that the first generation, fully absorbable scaffolds, the safety profile is open to question. We do have an interest in the space. Obviously, as a leader in DES we have to have that. And as you know also we have three shots on goal and our own internal FAST program which is a thinner strap, more deliverable stent, more compliant, less malapposition is in first human use trials now. And we are still anticipating commercialization in Europe in 2018. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then just your thoughts on Eluvia, how it's performing in Europe? And your thoughts on how it will perform in the United States once launched? Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. So we're early with our Eluvia platform. It's a large investment. We'll be announcing additional data sets on both our balloon and our stent at CIRSE, which I think is in Barcelona in September third quarter this year. So we'll continue to lay out our clinical data there. But I think just, again, the strength of having a \u2013 in Europe, a drug-coated balloon and a differentiated drug-eluting stents for the peripheral vascular offers physicians more options. And so it uniquely positions us in the SFA and it also helps us pull through our core portfolio. So I think these investments are paying off in Europe, based on the growth, and we've got to wrap up our clinical trial of Eluvia which we anticipate by year-end 2016. And so we look forward to that finishing. And then we'll provide additional comments on our balloon at our third quarter earnings call. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you for taking the questions. Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Glenn. Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President- Investor Relations : Great. With that, we'd like to conclude the call.

Welcome to the Boston Scientific Q3 2016 Earnings Call. During today's conference, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session; instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Susie Lisa. Please go ahead. Susan Vissers Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. For those of you having issues with the webcast, we apologize for the technical issues. We're working with NASDAQ and ask you to consult our Investor Relations section of our website to see the dial-in number. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q3 2016 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information. The duration of this morning's call will be up to one hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights of Q3 2016, Dan will review the financials for the quarter and then Q4 2016 and full year guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Keith Dawkins and Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, organic revenue growth is defined as excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from the acquisition of the American Medical Systems, AMS, Male Urology portfolio over the prior year period. Also of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate, and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance including sales, margins, earnings and other Q4 2016 guidance, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thank you, Susie. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter 2016 results were excellent and reinforce the success of our category leadership strategy and the strong execution of our global teams. We continue to grow faster than the market in most all of our business units, while consistently improving operating income margin. As a result, we continue to deliver strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Importantly, we are investing in new adjacencies, capabilities and markets that position Boston Scientific for a very exciting future. In third quarter 2016 we drove operational growth of 10% and organic revenue growth of 9%. Normalized for currency and excluding the impact of one month of sales of the AMS acquisition, which anniversaried on August 3. Of note, we delivered this 9% organic growth against our toughest comparison of the year and we leveraged that growth with a 120 basis point improvement year-over-year in adjusted operating margin of 24.3%, which beat the high end of our guidance range by 30 basis points. Thus 9% organic revenue in the quarter was leveraged to 12% EPS growth or $0.27 per share, which was at the high end of our guidance range. For the full-year 2016, we're maintaining our strong guidance and pulling up the low end of our previous ranges and Dan will provide the details in a few minutes. I'll now provide some highlights on Q3 results and our Q4 2016 outlook. In my remarks all references to growth are on a constant currency, organic, year-over-year basis and they exclude the one month benefit of AMS unless otherwise specified. Organic revenue growth of 9% was broad-based across our businesses and regions with particular strength from new global product launches, emerging market expansion and share gains led by innovation and our category leadership strategy. On a regional basis, EMEA led the pack with 12% growth, followed by the U.S. at 9% and Europe at 5%. Emerging market sales grew 19%, led by an acceleration in growth in China at 26% and Latin America turned in a strong quarter with 21% growth. Across our businesses for the third straight quarter both our Cardiovascular and MedSurg segments grew sales organically double-digits; 12% for Cardiovascular and 10% for MedSurg and Rhythm Management turned in a strong and consistent performance with second quarter sales up 3%. MedSurg continues to deliver excellent growth and strong profitability. MedSurg remains a high priority segment for the company with two recent tuck-in acquisitions to enhance category leadership in neuromodulation with Cosman Medical in RF ablation and Endoscopy with the recently announced tender offer for EndoChoice. 9% global growth in Endoscopy was led by double-digit gains in both our biliary and hemostasis franchises with SpyGlass Digital DS and the AXIOS Stent leading the charge in biliary and our newly launched Resolution 360 Clip is driving growth in hemostasis. We continue to see upside from new product launches and strong emerging market growth in Endo. We're also excited about the acquisition of EndoChoice, which we expect to close by year-end. EndoChoice is focused on the development of innovative products and services for gastroenterology healthcare providers with a portfolio that's particularly well-suited for the ambulatory surgery center. It also brings a portfolio of value-added services to the ASC market, including infection control and pathology services. This acquisition will further enhance the position of Boston Scientific as the global leader in the field of GI endoscopy. As previously announced, we expect to pursue strategic options for EndoChoice's FUSE colonoscope business. We plan to provide an update at or around the time of closing of this transaction. Turning to Urology and Public Health, Uro/Public Health grew double-digits for the third consecutive quarter, up 13% in Q3. We're a strong category leader in the Urology segment and we delivered broad-based growth across the combined Boston Scientific and AMS portfolio. International sales remain very strong with EMEA, Latin American and emerging markets all growing at double-digit rates, AMS sales grew 5% in the quarter, which is a nice acceleration from trend prior to acquisition and importantly, our remediation and integration efforts are both on track. Our LithoVue Single-Use Ureteroscope continues to launch and is enjoying strong uptake in a variety of accounts. And finally, our growth was assisted by tailwinds from our market share capture post ASTORA's exit from the pelvic health market. Neuromod grew double-digits, plus 12%, against a strong comp, and robust Precision Spectra sales, now with full-body MRI compatibility, and our Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation platform in Europe. We continue to expect U.S. market entry for Vercise by late 2017, and believe this is an exciting new market opportunity for us. Cosman Medical, an acquisition announced in July, broadens our Neuromodulation portfolio with RF ablation systems that enable us to offer patients with chronic pain another treatment option in non-opioid therapeutics. We will provide an update on our ACCELERATE clinical trial on our fourth quarter 2016 call. In Cardiovascular, segment sales grew 12% and reported an adjusted operating margin of 32.8%, up 160 basis points year-over-year. Peripheral Interventions revenue grew 11% and was led by strong balanced global growth in developed and emerging markets. This is PI's fourth straight quarter of double-digit above market growth, fueled by our category leadership strategy and the depth of our portfolio rather than any single product. We drove strong growth in the atherectomy and thrombectomy businesses and new product launches are also going very well, including the AngioJet ZelanteDVT catheter, the Innova Vascular Stent and our drug-eluting technologies, Eluvia DES and Ranger DCB. Finally, we're also pleased with the contribution and integration progress of the spherical embolics platform acquired from CeloNova. We continue to invest in the Peripheral market, particularly in drug-eluting strategies, venous diseases and interventional oncology. Two important clinical trials were presented in third quarter at the major European Peripheral Congress at CIRSE, our drug-eluting stent Eluvia and the MAJESTIC clinical trial demonstrated an unprecedented 92.5% freedom from total lesion revascularization at two years, and enrollment continues in our global IDE trial IMPERIAL. This 92.5% freedom from TLR is of particular note given the patient population studied. 65% of patients had severely calcified lesions, and 46% had chronic total occlusions. In addition, we reported results for our Ranger Drug-Coated Balloon from the 105 patient randomized clinical trial studying the superficial femoral artery. With 94.4% freedom from total lesion revascularization at six months, average lesion length was 68 millimeters. We also posted strong results from our Ranger All-Comers Registry, with 91.9% freedom from TLR at six months and an average lesion length of 135 millimeters. We plan to bring our Ranger DCB to the U.S. and we'll reveal details of our IDE trial shortly. We're excited to be the only company investing in the complete portfolio of drug-eluting therapies. Turning to Interventional Cardiology, this business segment grew 13% in Q3, led by strong sales in Structural Heart, drug-eluting stents, and PCI guidance or imaging. SYNERGY continues to penetrate the market, as we grew worldwide DES sales 14% and we remain on track to represent 50% to 60% of our global DES revenue mix by the end of fourth quarter. PCI guidance grew mid-teens as well, with strong IVUS catheter and service sales, augmented by the ongoing global launch of our COMET FFR system. In Structural Heart, which includes our LOTUS Transcatheter Aortic Valve and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device, we are driving growth via our unique innovative platform technologies, and they're resonating with physicians and are supported by the strength of our commercial teams. Both franchises are performing very well. We continue to expect to deliver Structural Heart revenue at the high end of $175 million to $200 million guidance for 2016. We also recently began the early launch of our LOTUS Edge Valve in Europe. Initial results from our feasibility study of LOTUS Edge will be presented this Sunday at our lunchtime symposium at TCT. Also at TCT next week, we look forward to a number of LOTUS presentations, including four-year outcomes on REPRISE I, three-year outcomes for REPRISE II, and our LOTUS Edge feasibility study, with a seven-day discharge data. We expect to present results of REPRISE III, our U.S. pivotal trial and the first to provide head-to-head data, at EuroPCR in May. The WATCHMAN platform also delivered an exciting quarter, with strong growth from opening new centers, as well as driving growth in existing centers. We are very encouraged to see a strong initial launch in France, where we received higher reimbursement to peers, based on the strength of our data. And we expect to enroll our first patient in ASP 2 (11:52), which is a study examining the use of WATCHMAN in warfarin-ineligible patients, before the end of the year. Turning now to Rhythm Management, segment sales grew 3% with another impressive gain in adjusted operating margin to 20.1%, which is 320 basis points quarter-over-quarter and a 230 basis point growth year-over-year. Growth in CRM of 3% was above market and led by worldwide patient growth of 22%, with meaningful share capture from our premium based Brady MRI device. High voltage sales declined 4% globally due to replacement cycle headwinds and competitive pressures in the U.S. and MRI compatible tachy devices. We continue to be pleased with the growth and momentum of EMBLEM S-ICD, which has been fueled by our recent FDA approval for both MRI and MRI backwards-compatibility, and increased physician acceptance of this differentiated therapy. In Europe, our CRM business grew above market for the 10th consecutive quarter and in Japan, our above market growth was driven by strong launch of EMBLEM S-ICD, transvenous tachy MRI and 3.0 T Brady MRI. We also achieved important CRM clinical milestones in the quarter, including the first patients enrolled in the APPRAISE ATP trial, to help clinicians understand which ICD patients could benefit from anti-tachycardia pacing, and which may be harmed. Also, our MultiSENSE trial was accepted as a late breaker for the upcoming AHA Scientific Sessions in New Orleans. MultiSENSE is an international multicenter non-randomized study which is designed to develop and to evaluate prospectively a multi-sensor based algorithm for the early detection of worsening heart failure. In Electrophysiology, 5% growth was led by strength in international markets. In Europe, we are pleased with the early feedback of our IntelliNav OI catheter, which was launched in the second quarter. We expect to launch this catheter in the U.S. in four quarter which, combined with IntelliNav XP and MIFI XP catheters, will unlock the use of RHYTHMIA to a higher mix of procedures. We remain bullish that continued penetration of our next-generation mapping and navigation system RHYTHMIA HDx and the commercialization of our complete portfolio of Nav-enabled therapeutic catheters will strengthen our global EP business and improve growth in 2017. So, to wrap up, I'd really like to thank our employees for their incredible winning spirit, terrific execution and commitment to the company. So, with that, I'll turn it over to Dan for more details on the P&L and guidance. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Mike. In Q3 we generated organic revenue growth of 9% versus our 7% to 9% guidance range and adjusted earnings per share of $0.27, representing 12% year-over-year growth and hitting the high end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.27. The double-digit adjusted EPS growth in Q3 was driven primarily by strong revenue growth and solid gross margin, which was at the high end of our guidance range. Consolidated revenue of $2.105 billion represented operational revenue growth of 10%, at the high end of guidance and reflects an immaterial impact from foreign exchange, which was in line with guidance. Excluding an approximate 100 basis point contribution from the AMS Male Urology portfolio acquisition for the month of July, organic revenue growth was 9% in the quarter and 11% on an as-reported basis. As a reminder, we completed the acquisition of the AMS Male Urology portfolio on August 3 last year. So, August and September AMS sales were included in our organic sales growth calculation. Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 72.5%, at the high end of our guidance range and consistent with prior year despite a year-over-year negative 120 basis point impact from foreign exchange. In Q3, as expected, we had lower inventory charges than in Q2 and we're now realizing the full benefit of the lower 2016 standard cost of our products due to ongoing value improvement programs. We continue to expect full year 2016 adjusted gross margin to be approximately 72%, which includes an expected 75 basis point to 100 basis point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $763 million or 36.2% of sales in Q3, down 70 basis points year-over-year, as we realized the benefit of our targeted initiatives focused on reducing SG&A offset partially by the reinvestment of the Medical Device Excise Tax benefit. We continue to believe our full-year rate will be approximately 36% which would be a 140 basis point improvement compared to 2015. Adjusted research and development expenses were $232 million in the third quarter, or 11% of sales, which is down 70 basis points year-over-year. We continue to expect our full-year 2016 adjusted R&D rate to be approximately 11% of sales. Royalty expense was 0.9% of sales in Q3, roughly flat year-over-year. Q3 2016 adjusted operating income grew 17% year-over-year and adjusted operating margin of 24.3% was above our guidance range of 23% to 24% and represented a 120 basis point improvement over Q3 last year, the ninth consecutive quarter in which we have expanded adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points or more over the prior year comparable period. The Rhythm Management team delivered an adjusted operating margin of 20.1%, up 230 basis points year-over-year. The increase year-over-year is a result of realizing the full benefit of 2016 product cost and leveraging the improved top line performance of the global business. For the first nine months of 2016 Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin is 17.9% and we continue to believe that that segment is on track to deliver an adjusted full-year operating margin of 20% in 2017. With total company adjusted operating margin for the first nine months of 2016 at 24.3%, this positions us well to achieve our full-year adjusted operating margin guidance of 24% to 24.5%, and we remain on track to reach our goal of 25% plus in 2017. We will provide more guidance on 2017 adjusted operating margin with our Q4 earnings call in February. Now, I'll move on to interest and other expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $58 million, roughly flat to Q3 of 2015. Our average interest expense rate was 3.9% in Q3 this year, compared to the same 3.9% in Q3 of last year. Other expenses was $33 million in the quarter, and includes approximately $20 million of impairment charges related to certain of our strategic investments. Other expenses for the quarter, primarily included foreign exchange losses related to our hedging program. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 11.2% on a reported basis and 12.4% on an adjusted basis. We are making progress towards finalizing our conditional stipulation of settled issues with the Internal Revenue Service and expect to make a series of payments related to the settlement, most of which we expect to remit during the second half of 2017 and into the first half of 2018. Finally, Q3 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $0.27 includes approximately $0.01 of unfavorable FX and represents 12% year-over-year growth or 17% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Earnings per share upside from the strong revenue and margin performance was partially offset by the $0.01 of impairment charges we recorded. On a reported GAAP basis, which includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $140 million after tax, Q3 2016 EPS was $0.17. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $440 million compared to $394 million in Q3 last year. And we continue to pursue inventory management initiatives designed to improve the working capital contribution to cash flow. Given the strong adjusted free cash flow generation year-to-date this year, we believe we can achieve our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance of $1.6 billion. In Q3 we used cash primarily to fund previously agreed legal settlements as well as business development activities. As of September 30, 2016 we had cash on hand of $237 million and near-term our capital allocation priorities continue to be managing contingencies and pursuing tuck-in M&A. We ended the third quarter with 1.380 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our share count to increase by less than 5 million through the end of 2016, as consistent with our commitment at the time of the AMS Men's Health acquisition last year, we plan to keep the buyback suspended for the balance of 2016. We expect this to result in a fully weighted average share count of approximately 1.380 billion shares for full year 2016. I'll now walk through the guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year 2016. For the full year, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $8.335 billion to $8.385 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 9% on an organic basis, 12% on an operational basis and 11% to 12% on a reported basis. We continue to expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $70 million for the full year. Turning to adjusted earnings per share, we now expect full year 2016 adjusted EPS to be in a range of $1.09 to $1.11, representing 17% to 19% adjusted earnings growth, which continues to assume the full year negative impact of FX will be $0.05. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share to be in a range of $0.32 to $0.34. Now turning specifically to the fourth quarter, we expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $2.140 billion to $2.190 billion. This represents year-over-year growth in a range of 7% to 9% operationally. We expect the foreign exchange impact on Q4 revenue to be a slight tailwind. For the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.27 to $0.29 per share and GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.15 to $0.17 per share. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q3 2016 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q3 results as well as Q4 and full year 2016 guidance, including P&L line item guidance. And with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A. Susan Vissers Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Dan. Shannon, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. In order to enable us, to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Shannon, please go ahead. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. A couple of financial questions this morning. So, just first off, Dan, I know, it's a bit early, but I think 2017 numbers, consensus is sort of in the upper part of mid-single-digits and around sort of 13% earnings. I'm wondering, if you could offer sort of any refinement, just given the strength we've seen here on 2016 and if you can, kind of refine this early, any headwinds or tailwinds we should be thinking about on the top line and bottom line, heading into 2017? Then I had a follow-up. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. David I don't think, we're going to provide any specific guidance for 2017, we'll do that as you would expect on our call in early February. We have been very public about saying that we believe next year is a mid-single-digit year in terms of revenue growth. But I wouldn't provide really any more than that at this point. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And maybe just two quick ones, one clinical one, one margin question. So for Dan, you eclipsed 20% margins here in CRM this quarter, I guess the question now is that's happening a lot earlier that many would have expected two years ago. So where can CRM margins go now? And then for fourth quarter margins to deliver the earnings, you need to do better year-on-year, with margins in the fourth quarter than you did in the second quarter and third quarter. So where can CRM go and the confidence in the fourth quarter margin? And then maybe for the clinical team, when do you think, we're going to get the first read on what the true pacing rates for LOTUS Edge? And I'll jump back in queue. Thank you. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure, David. I'll take the Rhythm Management operating margin, turn it over to Keith and Mike for the clinical question. So obviously very pleased to be at that 20% here in Q3 for Rhythm Management operating margin. It's 320 basis points sequentially and 230 basis points year-over-year. As you would expect in any given quarter, you'll see some variation in that. Would actually expect that to go back down in Q4, a little more spending in Q4 on SG&A initiatives and such. The full year should be about 18% which is what we've said consistently, that we would be this year and I think that puts us right in line to get to that 20% next year in Rhythm Management, which as part of us getting to 25% plus as a company, I think, gives us the confidence in both those numbers. So, I don't think we're going to talk more specifically about the 20% where it would go from there. Certainly it goes north of that. We're not going to stop at 20% in 2017. Just as a company, we're not going to stop at 25%. So, there is more room in that Rhythm Management segment to increase well beyond 20%, as the company goes to what we said publicly our goal of 27% to 28% operating margin by 2020. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yes. So, just on LOTUS Edge, good morning, David, just a couple high level comments and Keith could maybe highlight TCT, which we have an important investor meeting on Monday, quite a bit more detail there. But overall, we're really pleased. We continued to deliver our overall Structural Heart commitment in terms of our guidance. We guided to the high end of our $175 million to $200 million range for WATCHMAN and TAVR. Really pleased about the CE Mark for LOTUS Edge that we received among the (27:01) valves, we're very early in that phase. But over the long-term, particularly as you point to the end of 2017 and the future, 2018 and 2019, we believe we're very well positioned with our LOTUS platform in terms of our launch into these large global markets and eventually Japan, well positioned to gain share. We believe we have the very unique capabilities in terms of our operator control and physician control of the device, excellent PVL rates and our focus on improving the pacemaker rate. So, our aim will be to take significant share in these larger markets, and we're building momentum there. So Keith, if you want to touch on TCT? Keith D. Dawkins - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah, sure. David, this Sunday, the 30th, the LOTUS lunchtime symposium of TCT will be the first presentation of the first human use early feasibility data of Edge. Only 21 patients, but will certainly give us a guide, and we can discuss those data in more detail at the Investor Meeting on Monday morning at TCT. Also at TCT, we'll have the four-year outcomes for REPRISE I, the three-year outcomes for REPRISE II, and you'll get more Edge data at ACC and further Edge data, and of course our pivotal trial data REPRISE III primary endpoint at EuroPCR. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill lynch : Thank you and good morning, and I apologize for the background noise, I'm in an airport. So, first of all, just on behalf of the MedTech investment community, I'd like to thank you for a great third quarter, certainly some that have gone before you were starting to make investors nervous. So, congrats on a great quarter. I wanted to ask a modeling question of Dan and then a product question for Mike. So, first just on the modeling side, it's a little thing, but it stuck out to us, which was that your other income line was an expense of $33 million, and that hit EPS by probably up to $0.02, and I know you mentioned something in the prepared comments, but I'd just love to get a little bit of a better sense for what caused that uptick, and just where that line item goes from here, does it go back down to normalized levels that we've seen in the past? I just would love some comments on other income. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure, Bob. As you say, in the prepared commentary, we talked about a $20 million impairment in the quarter. We have an investment portfolio now that's over $300 million. So, as you'd expect, you may see impairments from time-to-time, it's not a regular occurrence. So that is the difference basically between the year-over-year comparison of that line, is that impairment, and it was worth about $0.01 overall. So, without that, we would have been a penny higher, but that should not be a regular occurrence \u2013 time-to-time, but certainly not a regular occurrence. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill lynch : Okay. So that line item goes back down to normalized levels. And then on the product side, I just wanted to get two quick updates. One is the timeline for MRI-safe ICDs in the U.S. still the same as your previous guidance, which I think was the end of 2017? And then, on WATCHMAN, I'm trying to gauge the impact at the start of the post approval study, what kind of impact that might have had on the NCD and the availability of reimbursement? So now that we've got that up and running, does that have a strong incremental impact on the ability of folks to get WATCHMAN properly reimbursed? Thanks very much. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. On the MRI-safe, no changes to our timeline there. We anticipate likely fourth quarter 2017. And importantly, in that category, we were down in the U.S. and down globally. But, our European business continues to do well, as our Asian business does, with our full line of MRI-safe products and the S-ICD continued to do very well. So despite not having it for what will be a decent a part of 2017, the pacer business continues to do very well. We're doing very well outside the United States, and S-ICD is continuing to support us and differentiate that platform. So we're very bullish on the future of our CRM business in the portfolio and despite that, the team continues to drive operating income margin improvements. So really nice job there. With WATCHMAN, we're continuing to build momentum there. As you mentioned, the reimbursement headwinds really are beginning to neutralize, based on the advances that we've made there. We continue to open up new centers and we're really tracking, we're not giving you much visibility to that. In the future we will determine how to do that. But we're continuing to focus on our utilization rate and driving more physician awareness, more patient awareness, and in parallel, doing a really nice job on physician training, so oftentimes training multiple physicians at the same site to increase utilization and in parallel, we're opening up a new center. So again, on the Structural Heart side, we're at the high end of our range, $175 million to $200 million, and WATCHMAN contribution is significant within there. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. And again, congrats on a nice quarter. 3Q by and large looks a lot like 2Q, so I actually have a couple of finance questions for Dan. The first question is, with the mesh liabilities and the IRS tax payments, can you fund that from OUS cash, or are you going to have to do any borrowing for that? Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Our plan is not to have to do any borrowing on that. We should have full access to our cash through 2017, and don't anticipate any borrowings necessary. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Second quick one, Dan, do you know at this point based on current rates what you think FX would mean to the bottom line in 2017, and simply we don't have a good visibility on your FX hedges and where they are and how they roll off. Do you have any insight to that at this point? Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. I think it probably makes sense to hold that until the February earnings call and give all the guidance package all together as opposed to kind of doing something one-off here. But have faith we'll give you full information on what we see as of February. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking the question. I just wanted two quick questions on CRM, post the MRI-safe pacemaker approval, you clearly had two quarters of significant success getting back share, any incremental color you can provide on how you've been so successful, anything in the market dynamics. And then any \u2013 also I was just curious about why we \u2013 should we be thinking of your pacemaker recovery as a precedent for ICD recovery once you have MRI-safe high-voltage approval? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks for the question Josh. We're pleased, we signaled at the end of the Q2 call that we thought overall CRM would be in line with 2Q, which we're pretty close to that. And we think fourth quarter will likely be in line with third quarter results. So, pretty consistent performance across our CRM business and you highlighted particular strength in pacemaker, really strong since the launch of our new products. I think it's a combination of an excellent lead, the ability to deliver that lead, excellent battery longevity in our pacer line, very strong commercial team, and a consistent actually stronger performance in the U.S. than we saw globally upon launching these products. So, the commercial team has done very well, and physicians are very comfortable. I don't know, Ken, if you have any additional comments on our MRI pacer from a physician standpoint? Kenneth Stein - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Josh, I think what's really helping drive the growth is the differentiated features we have in our Brady platform on top of MRI, including automated remote daily monitoring of these devices, including the performance of our newly released INGEVITY lead, we've had really fantastic feedback from clinicians since commercial release of that lead, validating excellent results we saw in the clinical trial. And I think in terms of what does that portend for tachy, I think we take a lot of pride in looking at how the portfolio is delivering in Europe, where we do have full approval of our tachy MRI products, including backwards compatibility to our previously released products and have MRI approval, both for traditional transvenous devices as well as for our S-ICD. And we believe that the same performance that we're seeing in Europe, where we have the full portfolio approved portends what we are we're going to see in the U.S. Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for those answers and just a follow-up. One of your big competitors has had a recall of their high voltage platform. They've had to design around, but how are you thinking about this as a potential opportunity for Boston going forward in front of MRI-safe approval on the high voltage side. Thanks a lot, gentlemen. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Well, I think, what we've done is, we very consistently promoted and we promoted with proof, the unique benefits of our ENDURALIFE battery technology as being best in class and that's really been proven out from nine independent studies, contemporary device longevity. So even prior to some of the challenges that St. Jude has seen, we've been very clear to the marketplace that we have very unique battery technology and also excellent remote monitoring. So I think those two features stand the test of time and really have been the anchor of our strategy for a number of years now and we believe over time particularly as healthcare modifies and more outcome-based that having that type of capability is enjoyed by \u2013 certainly by patients and also by physicians. So we think those unique strengths combined with our commercial team put us in a good position to compete. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question. Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Morning, everybody. Just to start with another LOTUS question. Mike, with LOTUS Edge approved and clearly some clarity on maybe better outcomes achieved with lower depth implant, when do you more broadly rollout the technology and this procedure approach to a broader audience? And maybe just tie that in as well to Dr. Meredith's appointment, as much as I'll miss Dr. Dawkin's dulcet tones and eloquent commentary, why the change now and bringing him in-house? What can you achieve with Dr. Meredith in-house versus out in the world? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Well, first I'd like to thank Keith. He's done a remarkable job at Boston Scientific. He has been here for nine years. He brings the patient focus first to our Executive Committee and has really helped, along with Kevin and our broader team, led the turnaround and sustained growth of our Interventional Cardiology business and moving to Structural Heart. So, Keith, done a terrific job, transition very smooth at the end of the year. Dr. Meredith is joining. Ian is very well known in the Structural Heart community. Structural Heart is a big investment and a key focus area for the company. And so there will be a seamless transition and Ian will begin early in the year. So you'll see him at various investor conferences and so forth. But Keith did a great job of transitioning. And again, I think just to repeat some of the comments earlier, we're very bullish on the future of our LOTUS platform for the reasons we've articulated with the PVL rates, the controlled release of this device and the enhancements that Depth Guard and LOTUS Edge promise to deliver. And we're being very appropriate in terms of the rollout of that. And at TCT we'll provide some additional information on pacemaker rates on some early clinical studies, as well as some additional commentary from Tom Fleming, Keith and Kevin Ballinger. Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Just to follow-up, Mike, on AMS. Obviously Urology had a good quarter on multiple fronts. Can you talk about AMS, where are you in the \u2013 in achieving the sales synergies that you hoped for? Are you starting to see it, and is that side of the story where you expected it would be, are you ahead, behind, just any perspective there would be very welcome. Thank you. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah, I would say, overall we're likely slightly ahead on the cost synergy side, done a very nice job with that. We're certainly ahead overall in terms of the strategic value of the acquisition, given the overall strength of our Urology business. And as a standalone business, the AMS business grew 5% in the quarter, which is slightly ahead of their kind of historical performance. So, we think in our hands, the standalone business is performing better and it will perform better. And more importantly, the complementary nature of the two businesses, with stone, BPH, ED is a very comprehensive package for our commercial teams to take to customers. And not only is it very broad-based, but it also has unique clinical differentiation. So, the combination of the two makes our legacy portfolio stronger. And so, overall we're clearly at or ahead of our internal deal models on the overall acquisition. Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI : Hey, guys. Congratulations on a nice quarter. I had two quick ones. Maybe I'll start with on the Structural Heart side. On LOTUS, can you maybe talk about competitive dynamics in Europe. Are you still gaining share? I know that you guys are not yet there in France. So maybe any perspective on that would be helpful? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. Yes, we are probably not going to give you as much detail as you'd like. Again overall, we're at our high-end of our guidance projected for our Structural Heart, obviously LOTUS is a key component to that. We're still, I think, it's safe to say, we're growing faster than the market in Europe. And what's important to note is, we don't have all the \u2013 all of our ammunition yet with LOTUS. We don't yet have our largest valve and our smallest valve. And so we're doing quite well in the market with three valves and we'll be excited about getting the additional two valve sizes for the full matrix. And I think, what's really different is kind of the same drumbeat. It's a different device, it's a next-generation platform that doctors really enjoy the control that they have with it. And so it's \u2013 I wouldn't say it's easy, but it's easier to differentiate this valve than some of the other balloon expandable devices that they have options to use in Europe. So we're very bullish on the future of it. In terms of France, we expect to have reimbursement by year-end 2017, so hopefully we'll see some upside from France reimbursement, ideally in the fourth quarter 2017. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI : Great. And then maybe one quick one on MedSurg. Again I think, this has been a phenomenal segment for you guys. And if I look at those really, really strong growth rates you've put up, can you help us understand, what's the underlying growth rate versus what's been the contribution from new products, right, because it's kind of hard for us to model and any sort of new product cadence that you have lined up for 2017, I think would be helpful. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. So our MedSurg business, particularly Endo and Uro doesn't have the \u2013 call it singular blockbuster devices or platforms like SYNERGY or WATCHMAN or LOTUS does. So Endoscopy is a very broad-based portfolio, as is Urology. We have some kind of star platforms in Endoscopy with our AXIOS Stent and our SpyGlass digital, but it's really a very broad-based portfolio that we continue to layer on new innovations to broaden out the adjacencies that we compete in similar to the recent acquisitions that we've done with EndoChoice and CeloNova. So really not one big product, but overall, you're seeing us increase the R&D spend in those businesses over the past few years. We've been more active in M&A in the Endoscopy, Uro and Neuromod area. And importantly, they were under-scaled outside the U.S. And we've put a lot of investment outside the U.S. over the past few years, and that continues to pay off, and that's not a one-time payoff, it will continue to payoff, as well as emerging markets. So it's really not a one product story, and it's very diversified strength in those businesses. Keith, there was something else on LOTUS TCT or did we cover that sufficiently? Keith D. Dawkins - Boston Scientific Corp.: I think we covered it sufficiently. French reimbursement is important, because France is the second largest European market with a high penetration of TAVR, TAVI and so we're looking forward to bringing the product to France. Obviously, there are French investigators in our trials, and they've been impressed with the acute performance of LOTUS. Operator : The next question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And Keith, good luck in your new endeavors. I'll miss working with you. Two product related questions. First on Neuromodulation and the ACCELERATE trial. You mentioned that you would give an update on the Q4 call in February. NANS this year is January, so does that mean we're not going to see the ACCELERATE data at NANS? And I have one other question. Thanks. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Larry, good morning. Yeah, our plan is to provide an update on the ACCELERATE trial at our fourth quarter 2016 earnings call, which is shortly after NANS, I believe. So our plan is to provide some additional color at that call, fourth quarter 2016. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So Mike, just to be clear, no data at NANS, is that what you're saying? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. Our plan is to provide additional insight in the fourth quarter... Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: ...2016 earnings call. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Clear. Thanks. And then on drug-eluting stent growth, obviously very strong this quarter. I think it accelerated to 14% from 9% last quarter. Was that balanced across geographies, and then, I know Keith, I think new competition will probably become more prominent at TCT, given the Biotronik data coming and the Medinol data coming as late breakers there. So any kind of previews from you on the competitive dynamics there? Thanks for taking the questions. Keith D. Dawkins - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Larry. I think the difference between some of the competitors and SYNERGY is that we have a very large dataset with SYNERGY. We now have approximately 20,000 patients in multiple clinical trials in a lot of high risk subsets of patients. And as you know, from the two-year data from the pivotal EVOLVE II trial, best-in-class stent thrombosis rates at two years. In fact, no definite stent thrombosis, not a single definite stent thrombosis after the first 24 hours. So we do think safety is an important metric, and we don't think we have any competition in that area. I think what will be interesting at TCT is some of the longer-term follow up of fully resorbable stents, particularly the three-year data from Absorb II, because if fully resorbable stents get better the longer they're in, in terms of remodeling and so on, that will be an important finding. Clearly the two-year data in that regard were disappointing. So we also like the acute performance of SYNERGY. The ease of use for interventional cardiologists worldwide is well appreciated. So we're very confident in SYNERGY, we had a very nice Japanese launch. And we think the appreciation of physicians is matched by the growth that you've seen in this quarter's figures. Operator : The next question is from the line of Matt Miksic, with UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking our questions. So I wanted to talk a little bit about the Endo Stitch (48:38) acquisition and the types of strategic investments and adds that you're looking at or thinking about. One of the things that struck us about that was this desire to kind of \u2013 to fill out that portfolio, better serve the ASCs. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks something like the \u2013 sort of the broad line, complete provider of solutions in that specialty. And just wanted to understand how you're thinking about acquisitions like that, the importance of sort of breadth, if you will, and where, if you see opportunities, also to kind of go deep on the \u2013 on sort of WATCHMAN-type innovation, type acquisitions? Then I have one follow-up. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. So we have a pretty active business development group and we're very disciplined in the types of deals that we look at, obviously need to focus on our strategic fit and also strong return. Dan also mentioned, we had a slight impairment with one of our venture investments, but we have a pretty significant venture investment portfolio that we think will bring strong value to the company, particularly as we look out at 2018 and 2019, which is very exciting. I think, just in terms of this deal, it's very consistent, the Endo deal with our strategy, which is, one is to continue to strengthen and diversify the company in the faster growth markets. So the MedSurg segment is a significant contributor. Endo business is a leader, but we were a little bit lighter in terms of our portfolio in the ambulatory surgery center. We also hadn't offered a pathology solution for this business. So it gives us a capability for, in the surgery center market, which is a nice extension, and expands us into some adjacencies in pathology and fills in a few products in our core business. So it will be a nice tuck-in acquisition, nice cost synergies, and probably on a lower risk scale in terms of integration. But we've also complemented those deals with some nice strong investments, obviously you mentioned the WATCHMAN acquisition. And also, I think our \u2013 hopefully our M&A track record is pretty solid. We're ahead of our deal model with AMS, we've done a very good job, the PI team with our Bayer acquisition, so we'll continue to look at acquisitions which support the strategy, diversifying to faster growth markets and category leadership, and we're very active in scanning the market in those areas. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks, Mike. And then, the follow-up for Dr. Stein. I know, Josh asked the question earlier about one of your competitors having a recall, and you certainly have the perspective on this much more than most of us, but doesn't seem like this is going to become any kind of market sort of clinician concern, patient concern event, as we've seen in the long history of CRM. But if you could maybe help put it in perspective, what you've seen so far, heard so far, any \u2013 if you have any concerns that this becomes sort of like a segment issue? Kenneth Stein - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Matt. I'm not going to comment about patient management for those patients who are affected by our competitor's advisory, I mean certainly, we take any individual patient safety issue, patient concerns, very seriously. Overall, we do not believe this is going to have any impact on market growth either in the U.S. or globally. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Please go ahead with your question. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks. Mike, can you talk a little bit more about the EndoChoice acquisition. The decision, in particular to explore options for FUSE, that product hasn't lived up to expectations yet, but it would seem like, plugging it into a larger sales organization could be the missing piece of the puzzle. And you guys have had some success historically on the imaging side of the business with SpyGlass, so why not keep that and see if you can realize that potential yourselves? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. We probably won't provide a lot of color on that. We certainly like the assets of EndoChoice and we're pursuing options. So we haven't declared fully that we are going to sell that business or retain that business. So more information to come likely at our next earning call, in terms of the status update there. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. And then you mentioned the ongoing replacement cycle headwind in ICDs, which has been an issue you've dealt with for a long time. What's your latest estimate for when that should turn positive for you? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: So we anticipate especially the likely second half of 2017, the flattening out and ideally a slight improvement on the CRT-D side, on the replacement cycle and then in 2018, on the ICD side. So some benefit in 2017 and more benefit in 2018, based on the modeling that we've done and that'll also come on the heels of a full 2018 launch of our MRI \u2013 full year benefit of our MRI capability. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: So just want to maybe close the call, and Dan talked about kind of mid-single digit guidance for next year. We will provide all that detail in second quarter. I think what we're most excited about is the future of the company and we talked quite a bit about the platforms that we'll be entering and markets approaching $8 billion to $9 billion in 2020. We'll detail this out at the Investor Day, but it's exciting future as we move into a very large market in TAVR expanded indications in the future with WATCHMAN, our drug-eluting technologies, a real commitment that we have to neuro-stimulation expanding to deep brain stimulation and potentially to other areas and really in the field of endoscopy where our team is looking at breakthrough capabilities to take more general surgery approaches to less invasive procedures. So, there's a lot of new therapies that the business will be entering that we'll show at our Investor Day that really give an exciting future to the company beyond our 2017 guidance that we'll provide in February. Susan Vissers Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: Great. With that, we'd like to conclude the call. Thanks for joining us today and we appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific.

Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Boston Scientific Q4 2016 Earnings Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Susie Lisa. Please go ahead. Susan Vissers Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thank you, David. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q4 2016 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights of Q4 2016 and full year 2016. Dan will review the financials for the quarter and then Q1 2017 and full year 2017 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith and Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, organic revenue growth is defined as excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from the acquisition of EndoChoice over the relevant prior year period. Also of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate, and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance including sales, margins, earnings and other Q1 and full year 2017 guidance, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Thanks Mike. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Good morning. Thank you, Susie, and good morning everyone. Boston Scientific delivered excellent financial results in Q4 2016 with 10% organic revenue growth, a 200 basis point improvement to profitability and 14% adjusted EPS growth. These Q4 results closed out a very strong 2016 overall, with 10% full year organic revenue growth, a 180 basis point improvement to profitability and 20% adjusted EPS growth to $1.11. This 20% adjusted EPS growth includes a significant $0.06 negative foreign exchange impact. We're pleased that we were able to overcome this FX headwind and still deliver strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our strategy of category leadership in key markets and a diversification into high growth adjacencies is working. It enables us continued investment in innovative medical technologies. We continue to execute against and exceed our strategic plan goals. We believe Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to drive shareholder value due to our long-term growth profile, ability to improve operating margin significantly and our track record for consistently delivering double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Point of fact for our previous stated goals, we continue to expect to deliver 25% plus adjusted operating margin in 2017, with plans to deliver an additional 300 basis points of improvement by year-end 2020 to 28%. We're excited about 2017 and our plans to build upon our global momentum. We are targeting full year 2017 operating revenue growth of 5% to 7% which includes an approximate 70 basis point contribution from the EndoChoice acquisition. We are guiding to adjusted EPS of $1.22 to $1.26, representing 10% to 13% EPS growth. Importantly, this EPS growth includes an expected $0.08 negative or 700 basis point headwind impact from foreign exchange. I'll now provide some highlights in Q4 and 2016 results, along with thoughts on our 2017 outlook. In my remarks all references to growth are on a, organic year over year constant currency basis unless otherwise specified. Our Q4 organic growth of 10% was once again very broad based across businesses and regions, led by exciting new product launches, continued global expansion and execution of our category leadership strategy. Diversification of our portfolio has helped us drive excellent results with Q4 sales of 11% in MedSurg, 11% in Cardiovascular and 7% in Rhythm Management. Five of our seven businesses grew revenue double digits and most of our businesses grew faster than the market. We delivered another quarter of balanced global growth led by 13% revenue growth in Asia, including 10% growth in Japan, 11% growth in the US and 7% in Europe. Another highlight was strong 17% revenue growth in the emerging markets, led by 21% growth in China. Importantly, the MedSurg businesses continued to deliver. In endoscopy, we posted 8% growth in Q4, fueled by the strength of our portfolio including the SpyGlass DS Visualization System, AXIOS Stent for pancreatic fluid collections and the Resolution 360 Hemostasis Clip. Sum of these three products led our full year 2016 endoscopy growth to 9%. And SpyGlass DS is an advanced single-use visualization system for the diagnosis and treatment of complex disorders of the pancreas and bile ducts. It's really a cornerstone platform that is highly differentiated and complementary to our core business. Our AXIOS Stent is used for transluminal drainage of pancreatic fluid and reflects the type of innovation we're bringing in endoluminal surgery and other exciting therapeutic categories including pulmonary and oncology to further enhance our global leadership position in endo. Finally, after closing the EndoChoice acquisition in November 2016, we're expanding our presence in the ambulatory surgery center segment of the market and are excited to offer physicians tailored services from the only GI-specific pathology laboratory in the United States. As previously announced, we're pursuing strategic options for the EndoChoice FUSE colonoscope business and we'll update you when possible. Turning to urology and pelvic health, we continued our strong performance, growing sales 14% organically in both Q4 and for the full year 2016, led by pelvic floor, laser fibers, strong international growth and the ongoing launch of LithoVue, our single-use digital scope. LithoVue is now in 500 accounts worldwide and provides visualization and navigation capabilities to diagnose and treat stones and other conditions of the kidney, ureter and bladder, while avoiding the need for repairs or sterilization that can be a challenge with reusable scopes. The AMS acquisition closed on August 15 and we're pleased to report that revenue from AMS grew 5% in 2016. We executed $35 million of AMS synergies in 2016 and remain on track to realize our adjusted EPS accretion goals of $0.07 in 2017. Turning to neuromodulation, we grew revenue 16% in Q4, led by a solid growth in the U.S. and strong international growth from both SCS and deep brain stimulation. We're also encouraged to see double-digit growth in U.S. spinal cord stim trialing in the quarter. European uptake of our Vercise DBS Stimulation System has been very promising, in large part due to the Cartesia Directional Lead platform and our partnership with Brainlab for cerebral visualization and mapping. We continue to expect to launch in the U.S. DBS market by year-end 2017. With respect to our ACCELERATE clinical trial program, after a pre-specified review of the data, we will continue enrollment through the end of 2017, with the results now expected in mid-2018. We do not expect to comment any further on the status of the trial until it has been completed. Our Cardiovascular group grew 11% in Q4 and 12% for the full year. Peripheral interventions grew 10% in the quarter, which is its fifth straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth and capping off 12% growth for the full year. Q4 organic revenue growth in the division was balanced regionally with double-digit growth in Europe, Asia and Latin America, and our single high-digit growth in the U.S. Our drug-eluting technologies and thrombectomy portfolio continued to deliver. In drug-eluting technologies, we have two near- term priorities : first, to complete enrollment in IMPERIAL IDE for our Eluvia drug-eluting stent; and secondly, enrollment for the IDE trial for our Ranger Drug-Coated Balloon in the U.S. Interventional cardiology continued its above-market growth trend, delivering 12% growth in the quarter and 13% for the full year. IC growth was led worldwide by continued strength in drug-eluting stents, PCI Guidance and structural heart. Global DES sales grew double-digit, led by SYNERGY, which ended the year at the high end of our guidance range for 50% to 60% of our worldwide DES mix. We're also really pleased to announce the recent approval of SYNERGY in China. PCI Guidance also grew double-digits on strong performance in both IVUS and our COMET fractional flow reserve platform. IC performance was also fueled by our structural heart business, which includes the LOTUS Aortic Valve and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure. As we disclosed last month, 2016 structural heart revenue exceeded our $175 million to $200 million guidance range. And we expect revenue from these two franchises to contribute approximately $300 million in 2017. We're truly in an exciting position to drive growth and share gains over the long run in these fast-growing markets. LOTUS delivered a strong quarter in the European market, as the platform continues to build momentum. LOTUS offers physicians unparalleled control during implantation and best-in-class paravalvular leakage rates. Importantly, we continue to enhance the LOTUS platform via LOTUS Edge, which is a more flexible and lower profile delivery system, and Depth Guard which minimizes LVOT interaction during deployment. We expect to present RESPOND extension data on LOTUS with Depth Guard at EuroPCR in May, which will provide further insight into reducing our PPM rates, while maintaining best-in-class PVL rates. We plan to restart the REPRISE EDGE study in Q2 and launch LOTUS Edge in Europe in Q3. We're also excited to present pivotal trial REPRISE III at EuroPCR in May and believe we remain on track for a second quarter PMA filing and FDA approval by year-end 2017. The WATCHMAN platform also delivered an exciting quarter with strong growth from existing centers and a continued steady pace of opening new centers. We ended 2016 with over 200 U.S. WATCHMAN centers and expect to close 2017 with approximately 350 centers. This quarter we plan to enroll our first patient in ASAP 2, which is a study examining the use of WATCHMAN in warfarin-ineligible patients and SALUTE, a trial specifically designed to pursue regulatory approval in Japan. So overall, we're extremely pleased with our progress in structural heart and excited about our capabilities and long-term prospects for this business. Global CRM sales accelerated to a very impressive 8% growth in the quarter, and 3% for the full year 2016 .In Q4, we delivered double digit growth in the US and low single digit growth overseas. The US strength reflects continued share gains with our ACCOLADE MRI Brady platform as well as strong global growth in EMBLEM S-ICD and Quad X4 CRT-P. In the quarter, Japan grew double digits on strong S-ICD adoption, and we're launching our MRI-compatible version of EMBLEM later this quarter in Japan. In CRM in 2017, we're very excited about our upcoming next generation high-voltage launches. The RESONATE family of ICDs and CRT-Ds will bring multipoint pacing to our CRT products. Updated best-in-class longevity labeling, via our EnduraLife batteries across all families of high-voltage devices and the first and only validated heart failure predictive diagnostic in HeartLogic. The clinical data supporting HeartLogic was presented as a late-breaker at AHA in November. And we have CE Mark in hand, and we'll begin the RESONATE launch in the EU shortly. US approval is expected in Q3. Turning to electrophysiology, we grew sales 5% in the quarter, and importantly, we're excited about our new RHYTHMIA HDx platform, which provides significant improvements in workflow efficiency and performance, and also enables the platform to support future innovative features and functionality. We're launching the HDx platform in Europe and expect to launch in the US in second quarter. We continue to strengthen our EP business, and we look forward to multiple therapeutic catheter launches in the second half of 2017 in the EU and the US. Our strategy of category leadership is working. It's helping us become a stronger partner to our global customers. Our company has excellent momentum going in 2017, and our outstanding 2016 results reflect the strength of our portfolio, our investment in the faster growth segments, our globalization efforts and focus on improving profitability. We believe we are poised for a strong 2017, and we're very well positioned to continue and strengthen our performance track record in 2018 and beyond, as we enter significant new markets with the differentiated products and platforms that address the unmet needs of physicians and their patients. I truly want to thank our employees for their high performance results, their winning spirit and commitment to advancing science and improving the lives of patients around the world. Now, let me turn the call over to Daniel for a detailed review of our financials. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Mike. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue of $2.191 billion represented 11% growth on both an operational and reported basis. This strong top line reflects an unexpected $20 million headwind from foreign exchange, compared to an immaterial tailwind expected at the time of guidance. Excluding an approximate 40 basis point contribution from EndoChoice acquisition that closed at the end of November, organic revenue growth was 10% in the quarter compared to our guidance range of 7% to 9%. We delivered Q4 adjusted earnings per share of $0.30, representing 14% year over year growth and exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.27 to $0.29. The double digit adjusted earnings per share growth in Q4 was driven primarily by strong revenue growth, and would have further exceeded our guidance range if not for certain inventory charges related to our LOTUS Edge voluntary field action. I'll provide more details on the inventory charges shortly. Our full year 2016 consolidated revenue of $8.386 billion grew 12% on both an operational and reported basis and 10% organically, which excludes the contributions from the AMS male urology portfolio and EndoChoice acquisitions in their respective periods. Full year 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $1.11 represents 20% growth, and excluding the $0.06 FX headwind that we effectively offset through operational savings and initiatives, adjusted earnings per share grew 26% versus 2015. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 72.6% compared to 72.8% in Q4 of 2015, and includes the year over year negative 120 basis point impact from foreign exchange. As a result of the LOTUS Edge voluntary field action initiated in November, in which we paused our European limited market release due to an issue with the deployment pin, we recorded inventory charges equivalent to approximately 50 basis points. Absent these charges, gross margin would have exceeded the high end of our guidance range. As disclosed last month, we believe we've identified both the issue and the solution to fix the deployment pin, which is a combination of minor process and specification changes and remain on track with our expected US timelines. For the full year 2016, adjusted gross margin was 72%, consistent with the prior year, despite the year over year negative 90 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Costs related to our new Malaysia manufacturing plant and AMS integration and quality remediation expenses. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $801 million or 36.5% of sales in Q4, down 170 basis points year over year, as we realized the benefit of our targeted initiatives focused on reducing SG&A, offset partially by the reinvestment of the medical device excise tax benefit. As we disclosed during the year, we spent the entire medical device excise tax benefit, but the majority of that reinvestment took place in Q2 through Q4. We continue to make progress on our margin expansion targets, as our full year 2016 adjusted SG&A rate of 36.1% is down 130 basis points versus full year 2015. Adjusted research and development expenses were $251 million in the fourth quarter, or 11.5% of sales, which is down 50 basis points year over year. For the full year 2016, adjusted R&D expenses were $914 million or 10.9% of sales compared to 11.4% of sales in 2015. Royalty expense was 0.9% of sales in both Q4 and the full year 2016, which is roughly flat year over year for both periods. Q4 2016 adjusted operating margin of 23.7% increased 200 basis points year over year and was slightly below our guidance range of 24% to 24.5% due to the inventory charges recorded in connection with the LOTUS Edge voluntary field action. Excluding these charges, operating margin would have been at the midpoint of our guidance. And even with these charges, Q4 represents the 10th consecutive quarter in which we have expanded adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points or more over the prior year comparable period. The Rhythm Management team delivered an adjusted operating margin of 17.9% for both Q4 and the full year 2016. This represents a year over year adjusted operating margin increase of 400 basis points for Q4 and 290 basis points for the full year, as the team continues to make progress on gross margin, focuses on expense control and leverages the improved top-line performance of the global business. For the full year 2016, total company adjusted operating margin of 24.1% expanded by 180 basis points over the full year 2015. We believe this sets us up well to deliver on our 2017 adjusted operating margin guidance in the mid-25% range, discussed in more detail shortly, and our longer-term 2020 adjusted operating margin target of 28%. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a total litigation related charge of $172 million, of which $170 million related to mesh and the remaining $2 million increase related to other legal matters. During the quarter, we became aware of additional mesh claims as we continued working through the settlement evaluation process, and have now reached conditional, final or near final settlement on 31,000 of our 42,000 claims. To determine our reserve, we continually assess the volume of known claims, estimated cost to resolve each claim, an estimate of the future claims, and the cost to defend each claim in order to calculate the required reserve and make any necessary adjustments. Having now settled or reached agreement in principle with nearly three quarters of all outstanding claims, we continue to reduce the risk on our balance sheet. Now I'll move on to interest and other expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $58 million, roughly flat to Q4 of 2015. Our average interest expense rate was 4% in Q4 compared to 3.9% in Q4 of 2015. Other expense was $7 million in the fourth quarter, and primarily included a net gain on investments of $13 million offset primarily by foreign exchange losses related to our hedging program. And for the full year, interest and other expenses were $233 million and $37 million respectively. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was negative 39.7% on a reported basis, and 11.2% on an adjusted basis. And for the full year, our tax rate was a negative 95.9% on a reported basis and 12.4% on an adjusted basis. The favorability in our adjusted tax rate versus guidance was due to a better than expected and sustainable geographic mix of profit. We're making good progress towards finalizing our conditional stipulation of settled issues with the Internal Revenue Service for the 2001 through 2007 tax years. We've now reached an agreement in principle with the IRS as to the resolution of the same transfer pricing issues for the 2008 through 2010 tax years, although final agreement is pending, additional calculations of tax and documentations. As previously disclosed, we expect to make a series of payments related to the settlement, most of which we expect to remit during the second half of this year and into the first half of next year. Furthermore, as a result of the settlement, we expect to have access to at least one additional year of O-US cash, which should put us through the end of 2018. Finally, Q4 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $0.30 includes approximately $0.02 of unfavorable FX and represents 14% year over year growth or 21% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The additional $20 million of negative FX on the top line created an additional $0.01 of unfavorable FX, which effectively offset the net gain on investments recorded in the quarter. On a reported GAAP basis, which includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $291 million after tax, Q4 2016 earnings per share was $0.09. For the full year 2016, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.11 at the high end of our guidance range while absorbing $0.06 of unfavorable FX. Full year 2016 adjusted earnings per share grew 20% over the prior year and 26% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, 2016 earnings per share was $0.25 compared to a full year 2015 GAAP loss per share of $0.18. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $454 million compared to $448 million in Q4 of 2015. In the quarter, we used cash primarily to fund previously agreed upon legal settlements as well as business development activities. As of December 31, 2016, we had cash on hand of $196 million. Our full year 2016 adjusted free cash flow of $1.607 billion met our stretch goal for the year and represents growth of 18% over the full year 2015. Capital expenditures for the full year 2016 totaled $376 million, slightly ahead of our $350 million target, as we made opportunistic land and equipment purchases to help invest for additional capabilities and to build future capacity. Recall that the higher CapEx spend in 2016, which compares to $248 million in 2015, largely reflects the greenfield build of our Malaysia facility. We initially expected an incremental $100 million benefit to free cash flow in 2017 as significant portions of the construction are now behind us. However, we now expect a slightly smaller incremental benefit of $75 million, resulting in a targeted $300 million in CapEx in 2017 due to additional investments in LOTUS Valve and SYNERGY manufacturing equipment due to higher than planned volumes as well as campus consolidation and plant network optimization activities that were both included in the restructuring program, which was not approved until mid-2016. This higher CapEx investment is reflected in our adjusted free cash flow guidance for full year 2017 at $1.750 billion. Near term, our capital allocation priorities continue to be managing contingencies, pursuing M&A, and as of January 1, 2017, share buybacks as our share buyback program is no longer suspended. Any purchases under our share repurchase program would be subject to business development opportunities, market conditions, our stock performance, regulatory trading windows and other factors. We ended Q4 with 1.377 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. And we expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.395 billion for Q1 2017 and full year 2017. I'll now walk through the guidance for Q1 and the full year 2017. For the full year, we expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $8.675 billion to $8.875 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 5% to 7% on an operational basis, including an approximately 70 basis point contribution from EndoChoice, and 3% to 6% on a reported basis. We expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $125 million for the full year 2017. We expect our adjusted gross margin for the year as a percentage of sales to be in a range of 72% to 73% for the full year, which assumes a negative FX impact of 50 basis points. We expect this headwind to be offset by favorable mix, standard cost reduction programs and the ramp of accretive new products. We expect full year adjusted SG&A to be in the range of 35% to 36% of sales as we continue to see the benefits of programs currently underway continuing to offset our reinvestment of the medical device tax suspension benefit. In 2017, we will again reinvest the full benefit of the suspension with strong investments in structural heart and other exciting and durable growth platforms. Full year adjusted R&D is expected to be in a range of 10.5% to 11.5%. And we expect our royalty rate to remain at approximately 1% of sales for the year. This implies a full year 2017 adjusted operating margin in a range of 25% to 26%, which would deliver on our goal from both our 2013 and 2015 Investor Days to deliver 25% plus adjusted operating margin in 2017. At the midpoint of 25.5%, this would represent 140 basis points of improvement over the full year 2016. We forecast our 2017 adjusted tax rate between 12.5% and 13.5%, including approximately a 125 basis points of benefit from adopting the new accounting standard for stock compensation. Absent the new standard, we would have forecasted an adjusted tax rate of approximately 14%. This forecast is approximately 100 basis points lower than the previous direction we provided due to the sustainable favorability in our 2016 tax rate as well as the access to the additional year of OUS cash that I mentioned. We continue to expect our tax rate to rise by 100 basis points annually for the next few years. As a result, we expect full year 2017 adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.22 to $1.26, representing 10% to 13% adjusted earnings growth, which now assumes the full year negative impact of FX will be approximately $0.08 or approximately $0.02 per quarter compared to our previous expectations of $0.06 to $0.07, due to the volatility in rates we've seen over the last few months. In addition, our EPS guidance includes a $0.02 benefit from the accounting change related to stock compensation, the majority of which will occur during the first quarter due to vesting of our annual grants. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share to be in a range of $0.86 to $0.91. Turning to Q1 2017, we expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $2.050 billion to $2.100 billion. This represents year-over-year growth in a range of 6% to 8% operationally, including the 70 basis point contribution from EndoChoice. We expect the foreign exchange impact on Q1 revenue to be a $20 million headwind. For the first quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.29 to $0.31 per share and GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.18 to $0.21 per share. As a reminder, our Q1 2016 operating margin of 25.1% was the highest of the year and resulting adjusted earnings per share of $0.28 was also higher from not yet spending the full benefit of the medical device excise tax suspension. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2016 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q4 and full year results, as well as Q1 and full year 2017 guidance, including P&L line item guidance. So, with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A. Susan Vissers Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Daniel. David, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. David, please go ahead. Operator : And the first question will come from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning and thanks for taking the questions and also congrats on another fantastic quarter. Maybe just a couple items. So, number one, Dan, could you share with us your thoughts on the cadence of organic growth over the course of the year? Obviously your comparisons get more difficult and so would love to just get your thoughts in terms of how the year plays out, number one. Number two, the CRM business benefited particularly on the ICD side from the challenges at St. Jude. Just can you give us your thoughts on sustainability? Then I'll sneak in a third, which is just the comment on the ACCELERATE trial, Mike, basically it sounded like you were trying to enroll some more patients at the corrected or new lead position. Is that accurate? Thanks. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure, Mike. Thanks. I'll take the cadence of growth and then Mike can take the other two. In terms of that, I think it really comes down to comps. So obviously very pleased with the organic revenue growth of 10% in Q4 and the full year last year, and believe we've got good momentum heading into 2017. And I think the overall guidance that we have from what we've seen compares very favorably to our peers. When you look at comps, I think that's really where that the Q1 and then the rest of the year story comes in. Our comp for Q1 in 2017 is 8%, so slightly lower than the next three quarters, which are 10%, 9% and 10%. So that's really the cadence as to why Q1 is higher than what you'd see in the last three quarters, is really comes down to overall comps for the company. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure and thanks, Mike, a couple comments on CRM. We're obviously really pleased with the performance in the quarter. The business as we talked about grew 8% in the quarter, 3% for the full year, which is we think nicely above the marketplace. And pacer growth has been very strong, 22%. There is some competitive approvals, which we thought would happen about six months ago. But we still expect to do, grow our pacer business beyond the marketplace in 2017. Really excited about what's going on in defib globally. The S-ICD continues to be highly differentiated, continues to have strong uptake around the world, and really is a very big differentiator for our defib platform. We have our MRI defib platform approved international markets. We hope to have that done by the end of the year in the US. And what we're really excited about, I commented briefly on the script is the RESONATE launch, which will be effectively in first quarter in Europe. And we think this is very unique, has very differentiated multipoint pacing. It even extends our longevity benefit greater based on additional labeling, and also contains \u2013 we can detail it more with Ken and also at Investor Day, HeartLogic, which we think is a very differentiated heart failure diagnostic tool only available on the RESONATE platform. You combine that with we think CRT, our headwind in replacements will become a bit more of a tailwind throughout 2017. So we think the future is bright in CRM, and particularly once we have our defib MRI approval at the end of the year. With respect to your third question, you snuck three in there, very impressive. With the third one on the novel (34:23) ACCELERATE, really not much more to comment. We were enabled a pre-specified interim review of the data that was constructed as part of the trial design. We obviously took advantage of that. We feel it's in our best interest, especially given the growth of that division, 12% growth for the full year and 16% in the fourth quarter, and strong momentum internationally and US in spinal cord stim. So we'll continue to enroll that ACCELERATE trial, Likely take to the end of 2017 to finish enrollment, and we'll report out the results when appropriate likely in mid-2018. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Perfect. Thank you, Mike. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, and I'll just throw in two to get us back on track, but congrats on a good quarter. Dan, just one on cash for you, and then maybe a broader question on R&D. I guess first of all on cash, so cash flow starts becoming a much bigger driver to the business here over these next three years, specifically kind of 2018 and 2019. But you do have significant cash outflows this year. Could you sort of walk us through the timing of sort of mesh and tax payments here in 2017? And with the magnitude of those payments, what impact does that have this year on interest or ability to do M&A and buybacks? And then another question sort of financially or maybe broadly for Mike. Your R&D spread this year is wider than I can remember in past. I maybe wrong about that, but it seems they're pretty widespread. What gets you to the low end and the high end of the R&D investment cycle this year? And I'll jump back in queue. Thank you. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure, David. So relative to the cash question, I think as you know, we've a significant effort underway to really to derisk and eliminate a lot of the larger liabilities from the balance sheet, as you mentioned, two of the biggest ones being the tax and the mesh. The way we would look at that is by the middle of 2018, we should have put the majority of mesh behind us, right. As you heard in the prepared comments, 31,000 out of the 42,000 are behind us now relative to settlement. The payment of that obviously will lag a little bit, but 2017 and into tail end of 2018 is what we would see there. The tax, we've mentioned that before, a little more than $500 million, and that should be the majority of that in the back half of 2017 and some might trickle into 2018. So 2017 may be a little bit more constrained on the cash side, although I will say from a credit rating perspective, and our leverage metrics, we start to really free that up as we get to the back half of this year and get back to our capital structure goal. So probably have a little bit more room on that front. So I'd look at 2017 as putting a lot of those liabilities behind us and really freeing it up for 2018 and beyond. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah thanks, David. On the R&D side, we do spend full year almost 11%. Fourth quarter went up a little bit more at 11.5%. We're actually quite pleased about our ability to invest in R&D, and it really gives us the confidence to deliver a strong 2017. And importantly, as we've outlined, we think we'll accelerate growth in 2018 and beyond. A big part of the spend, especially you saw the uptick in Q4 as we have a number of significant clinical trials going on, and the weighting of our clinical trial mix within R&D is a bit higher given that. So, we have two significant trials going on at PI and the drug-eluting, which we think will differentiators us for years to come in that area. We have a lot of clinical work going on in WATCHMAN and significant clinical spend in LOTUS globally. And so we do expect over time that our R&D as a percent of sales will decrease a bit as we march to our operating income targets. But right now, we're going through a heavier bolus of investment at clinical, which will pay off for the company in 2018 and beyond. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And Mike, sorry, I may have lied. I want to just follow quickly on the clinical spend. One of the clinical trials, I think you mentioned obviously accelerating the update there. I may have missed it, on WHISPER, can you just update us on the timing for WHISPER and when we could expect data? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. So that one is on track. The detail is obviously in clinicaltrials.gov. We believe that we'll finish the enrollment of that trial by the year end 2017, so December 2017. And so we haven't provided any additional details on the readout of the data, but we hope to finish enrollment by the end of the year. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Could it be NANS 2018 or probably too early? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Actually not sure. So, we'll finish the trial, then we'll go through the appropriate steps. Not sure if it will happen in NANS or not. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much. Nice quarter. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, David. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : Hi. Thanks. Okay. Can you hear me? Can you hear me okay? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Can hear you fine, Bob. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : Great. Good morning. So, I have two questions. The first one is on LOTUS. I just wonder if you guys, if you could just confirm that the device you expect to have approved in the US is indeed LOTUS Edge. And then can you just give us a sense as to when we'll next see some longer term pacer rate data from the LOTUS Edge Australia or the patients that were enrolled in REPRISE Edge before the ship hold? Just curious as to when we'll see some more data there. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Bob. Yes, we do expect to launch in the US with LOTUS Edge. We're optimistic that we'll have approval by year end of 2017 and I'll have Dr. Ian Meredith comment a bit more on some of the clinical information. Ian Meredith - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Mike. So, to address the question of pace, longer term data with pacemakers, at the ACC meeting, you will see 30-day data presented on the first-in-human use of the LOTUS Edge platform. We presented that data as a seven-day discharge data at TCT last year. So you will see 30-day data at ACC. And at EuroPCR, you will see longer term follow-up data on the LOTUS with Depth Guard, which will provide significant insight into the benefits of Depth Guard technology on LOTUS Edge. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then one follow up for Dan on the finance side. Two quick things, one can you just give us your updated views on the potential impact of tax rate reform? Just given your low tax rate, just any updated thoughts there would be great. And then also maybe if you could just quickly comment on why the FX headwind is a little worse. You mentioned greater volatility in rates, but looks like rates have kind of gone in your favors since you last gave guidance. So just curious as to why the FX hit is a little worse than you talked about in December. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. I'll hit the FX one first. Yeah, and it really is, it's the market basket of all the currencies that we track, right. So we hedge certain ones, largely the yen and the euro. But when you look at what's happened since we had kind of snapped the line on that, the overall trend does see $0.08 versus the $0.06 to $0.07 that we had. And it's also a function of the hedges that we have, when we layer in the hedges and how those roll off. So the $0.08 is the most accurate number as we sit today. In terms of tax reform, just broadly, obviously a lot of proposals out there. And where we support it, right, relative to making something we have competitive tax rates for the US companies versus global peers, and that provides us as US companies with much better access to our global cash flows. There's a lot of uncertainty out there relative to what the timing would be and the details are pretty scarce relative to transition rules as well. So as you would imagine, we follow that very closely. Some of them are good for us. Some of them are not as good for us and once the tea leaves are out and we see some final proposals, we'll let folks know what the impact is. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : But could it put some upward pressure, though, on the guidance that you've given or? Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Well, it really depends on how they come out. Let me just give you an example, right. So the interest rate deductibility, right, the timing of when that will be put in and what could potentially be grandfathered. Are you, is it from dollar one, are you grandfathered with the existing debt on your balance sheet today, is it only future debt? Those types of things could have big swings. And so it's tough to guess until we actually see what comes out as a final rule. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : Thanks, guys, and congrats on the 10%. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Bob. Operator : Next we go to the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning everybody. Michael, actually I think I'll start with Daniel. Balance sheet again here, starting in 2018, just following up in your earlier comments, it looks like free cash flow is going to be relatively less encumbered as you move past some of these past challenges. And when you think about it, assuming further growth and less encumbrance, I mean as I think about 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, I mean you could be generating $4 billion, $5 billion, $6 billion in total cash during that period. That might be a bit optimistic, but even in a period where your cash was encumbered, you were able to be active on the M&A front. Maybe just reflect on some of these topics and as you look out beyond 2017, how are you thinking about that cash opportunity? Will you be more aggressive on M&A portfolio? Are you going to be more aggressive on share repo, instate a dividend? Just help us reflect on those. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. Thanks, Richard. In terms of looking out beyond 2017, I think you've hit on it and it kind of goes to the answer to the earlier question from David as well. 2017 and the first half of 2018 is really putting a lot of the liabilities and the things that we have today behind us and I'm excited for that time when we get to 2018, 2019 and beyond as you mentioned. So, our goal this year is $1.750 billion in cash flow. Safe to assume that grows. We've talked recently about having $6 billion over the 2017, 2018, 2019 timeframe in terms of accessible cash and being able to put that to use in M&A and share repurchase have been historically and I think would continue to be our two most favorite uses. The dividend probably in the short-term is probably not in the cards, but it's something that we continue to look at every year and would evaluate that as we go through those years as well. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. A little follow-up on LOTUS. How optimistic are you that with the evolving implant technique for LOTUS that the pacer rate will stay down at more competitive levels? We had some encouraging conversations with European physicians. And maybe talk about the process of \u2013 and how long it's going to take to retrain European docs, so that you can generate that better data on the higher implant position? Thanks. Ian Meredith - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Rick. It's Ian Meredith here. I think I could take that question. I think there are four lines of evidence that support the notion that the pacemaker rate will be substantially lower. The first you have already mentioned is the depth of implantation, even with a classic LOTUS. And that's a widespread practice that is taking place now. And you will see the emergence of more and more similar centers reporting their data with a classic LOTUS device showing lower pacemaker rate. And I think we'll see several more of those abstracts actually appear. So that's the first line of evidence. The second is classic LOTUS with Depth Guard. You will see presentations at CRT coming up in a week or two on RESPOND Extend which will, of course, only be seven-day data. Meaningful data will be presented at EuroPCR, so that's LOTUS with Depth Guard. That will be an important line of evidence. Then we'll have the trials of the extension of the data that we already have from the first-in-human study that you know of from TCT last year, will be presented at ACC. And then finally the REPRISE EDGE trial which will be the full complement of patients at EuroPCR. So there are four streams of evidence that seem to be moving in the right direction. The technique for implantation I think has been widely adopted already. And that sets a very strong foundation for people's ability to use Depth Guard when they move to LOTUS Edge. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Brooks West with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Good morning. Can you hear me? Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yes, Brooks. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: We hear you fine, Brooks. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask a question on the cardiovascular franchise. You've got a monster comp that you're looking at for next year and wanted to understand some of the growth drivers in that franchise that might offset. So, would love thoughts on SYNERGY. Are you at peak mix? Is there further penetration of market share to be had? I don't know if there is anything you can give us on structural heart and expectations there. And then also, I wanted to hit your thoughts on the ATTRACT trial that we're going to see at SIR in March and how that might impact Jeff's venous business. Thanks. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. Yeah. We've earned a tough comp in IC and we're proud of it. And I think the most important thing to think is our IC business is very broad. We used to be a DES company and now we're clearly DES, but all the structural heart initiatives, our complex PCI. We'll continue to roll out a new FFR platform. So the diversity of the IC portfolio is quite strong. Certainly, we do have some challenging comps, but we're comfortable that we're going to grow above market. And I think if you just look at the momentum that we have in the structural heart business, that will be a growth driver overall for IC. We have a nice new launch coming with SYNERGY in China. And we'll continue to expand our SYNERGY market share. We do think we'll likely won't give a number. We do believe there is more mix improvement we can have with SYNERGY given its acceptance of that platform globally. And we also have a number of new launches. I would call them incremental, but they all help, cutting balloons and so forth in complex PCI. So I think given the diversification and geographies, the breadth of that portfolio, the exciting growth in structural heart and our complex CTO bag as well as improved mix of SYNERGY opportunity in China will help grow that business well in 2017. On ATTRACT, I think that's potentially great upside for the company. I believe that study gets read out in March and we're well-positioned for that business with our ZelanteDVT catheter, our commercial base globally and also just the capabilities we have in venous broadly. So, we'll see how it happens in March, but that could provide some additional upside for that franchise obviously in 2017 and well beyond, especially if that study is positive. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks. And then just one follow-up. Have you said or can you remind us, Mike, what's the most recent timeline for LOTUS Edge back on the market in Europe? Thanks. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: We've quoted early third quarter is our aim for LOTUS Edge back in Europe. So we want that to happen, but it's important to note that our current LOTUS platform is doing extremely well in Europe. And you talk to many physicians and they certainly want LOTUS Edge, but they're very happy with LOTUS and its current capabilities, its ability to position the device, low PBL rate. So, we want to launch LOTUS Edge, but we're more than pleased with the growth of our current LOTUS platform. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Perfect. Thanks, guys. Operator : Next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on a great year, guys. Let me start with the 2017 guidance. Just to ask a different way, the mid-single-digit growth in 2017. It's obviously the deceleration is driven by tough year-over-year comps. Dan, can you help us think through the different puts and takes for the businesses as it relates to 2017? In other words, what slows this year versus 2016? Is it across the board? Are there certain areas that are more pronounced? And I had one follow-up. Thanks. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. So, we're obviously pleased with our performance in 2017 and momentum \u2013 I'm sorry in 2016 and momentum going into 2017 and beyond here. You hit the first one. We're coming up against a 10% organic comp. And the good news for the company, it's broad-based. As I said, five of the seven divisions grew double-digits in Q4. And so, we do have tougher comps really across the board, but that's really offset by strong momentum that we have really across each business. So the comps are tougher, but we have strong momentum and I don't think I have time to go through each division. Each division has continued on product launches that we can expand globally, a number of new launches. Just take CRM for example. In a tough market we're growing above market and we're really excited about this new RESONATE platform that will launch right now in Europe and likely third quarter in the US. One that we don't talk about, we have some momentum building we believe in our EP business with our new HDx platform. That's just in rhythm management. I talked about IC a little bit ago with Brooks. And also PI, MedSurg continues to do well. Endo is moving into new markets based on our EndoChoice acquisition, the AXIOS Stent. Neuromodulation continues to do well. So we have a extension of our product launches that we have. We'll continue to grow globally. The business has momentum, which is difficult to build for a company, and we're going to continue to press on that. And what's most important for us is, while we deliver a strong 2017, all these new platforms that we're investing in now that give us the higher R&D spend begin to generate even more fruit we think in 2018 and beyond. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : That's very helpful, Mike. One for Dr. Meredith on LOTUS. Dr. Meredith, in the past you've talked, you've said publicly you expect the REPRISE III data to be similar to the head-to-head study you published in JACC in 2015. Is that still the case? And can you comment, I know we've talked about this before, and I just can't remember what the response was, but there did seem to be a little bit of a higher stroke rate for LOTUS in that study compared to CoreValve. Can you remind me why that isn't a concern for you? Thank you very much for taking the questions. Ian Meredith - Boston Scientific Corp.: Larry, it's a great question. I think the best comparison we still have for the REPRISE III data, until the data is known, is the study that you actually mentioned. That of course was not a randomized trial. It was a consecutive comparison and propensity matched patients. So one would assume that the pacemaker rate would be somewhere in that vicinity. Having said that, we have seen the uptake of a higher implant technique across the world and that will influence the practices in the US. So it's hard to predict exactly what the pacemaker rate might be. But I think it would be safe to assume that it would be similar to something that is published in the JACC manuscript that you mentioned. The second question with the stroke rate, I don't believe that there is an appreciable difference in disabling stroke. The difference, and as was identified in that manuscript, was that there was a pre-specified neurological assessment before and after valve deployment, which means that there was a lower threshold to detection in the LOTUS arm of that study than what we had for the CoreValve arm. So, I suspect that the rate of disabling stroke, which is troublesome for all valves, will be comparable between the two groups. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: You're welcome. Operator : We also have a question from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays. Please go ahead. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So, the first question I had was, Dan, when you are talking about this operating margin expansion, I thought maybe it was worth revisiting the sources of that for 2017. I mean, certainly you gave us an overview a while back for the long range plan. But can you talk about the specific components of the operating margin expansion for 2017? And just kind of give us an update on how some of those initiatives have gone, and what's left to go in the tank as you move toward the high 20s? Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. The good news is, Matt, it's across the entire P&L and you can see that when you look at our ranges for 2016 versus 2017. It's expansion in each of the key areas. So when you look at gross margin, we were at 72% for 2016. The range is 72% to 73% and that includes offsetting a 50 basis point headwind from FX. That's continuing to launch accretive products. It's optimizing our plant network and it's really being maniacally focused on reducing standard product cost in a year over year comparison. So, that's really where we get the majority of the benefit in gross margin. SG&A, we have a companywide initiative, as you've heard about over the last couple years, to really drive that down. You saw the benefit this year in terms of the reduction in our SG&A rate as a percentage of sales. You see it again next year in terms of what we've given for guidance. And then, Mike (sic) [Matt], the commentary around R&D, R&D is really not the hunt in the current configuration to generate additional operating margin. It's more in the SG&A and gross margin lines. But the two of those are what get us to that 25.5% midpoint for 2017. And then as you look out getting to that 2020, there's probably a little bit less on the gross margin side and more on the SG&A and R&D side to get us to that 28% by 2020. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. And then I just had a follow-up on tax. I mean understanding nobody has the answer to this, I wanted to know if you could help us understand what your exposure could be to a border tax. And then are you doing anything differently as a management team to prepare for these potential changes, whatever composition we might see? Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: No. As I mentioned to the answer to the earlier question, we obviously are very close and plugged into the entire process relative to the border tax, where I would call as a slight net importer. So the border tax would probably be a net negative for us overall. But again, it depends on how that comes in terms of a configuration, what's the rate, what's included, what's excluded and then there are other parts of tax reform that are beneficial around the cash access and others. So, we really need to see the different elements of how the final proposals come out, put that through and see what the impact is. In terms of whether we're doing anything differently, other than monitoring it and really staying close to that, no, we haven't changed our strategy as a team. Mike mentioned earlier category leadership and driving that. And so, we're monitoring tax reform, but not changing anything we're doing. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot. Susan Vissers Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: All right. David, with that, we'd like to conclude the call. Thanks for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Your hosting speaker, Susie Lisa. Please go ahead. Susan Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q1 2017 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We've posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call, to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights of Q1 2017. Dan will review the financials for the quarter and then provide Q2 2017 and full-year 2017 guidance. And then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith and Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, organic revenue growth is defined as excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from the acquisition of EndoChoice over the relevant prior-year period. Also note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like : anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q2 and full-year 2017 guidance, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thank you, Susie. Good morning, everyone. After an outstanding 2016, Boston Scientific continued its strong momentum and began 2017 with another quarter of strong results. I'm proud to report that team delivered our sixth straight quarter of 10% or greater operational revenue growth, with first quarter 2017 sales up 10.3% on an organic basis this 9.4% revenue growth represents another quarter of outstanding growth across our various businesses and regions. At the same time, we continue to invest in meaningful innovation to build out our category leadership across all businesses and drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth over the long term. Also, we're able to meet our commitments and deliver adjusted EPS of $0.29, which is within our guidance range, despite $0.03 of a one-time EPS hit from inventory charges related to LOTUS field action as well as losses incurred before we discontinued sales of the acquired EndoChoice FUSE System. Adjusted EPS grew 9% year-over-year, excluding the $0.02 negative impact of FX, which came in as expected. If we were to exclude both the FX and one-time inventory charges, adjusted EPS would have grown 18% versus prior year. Our strategy of category leadership in key markets and diversification into high-growth adjacencies continues to work, as we are delivering consistent above-market growth. In parallel, we continue to invest in new, innovative platforms via our internal programs, like M&A. The Symetis structural heart acquisition we just announced last month. We believe Boston Scientific continues to be uniquely positioned to drive shareholder value due to our strong growth profile, significant opportunity to improve operating margins and our track record of consistently delivering double-digit adjusted EPS growth. We're excited about 2017 and our plans to build upon our global momentum and drive sustainable long-term growth. We also raised in the low end of our full-year 2017 operational revenue growth guidance from 5% to 7% to 6% to 7%, which includes an approximate 70 basis point contribution from the EndoChoice acquisition, consistent with our expectations coming into the year. Despite the LOTUS inventory charge and FUSE costs that clipped $0.03 of EPS in Q1, there is no change to our full-year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.22 to $1.26. And this represents 10% to 13% earnings growth and includes an expected $0.08 negative impact, or approximate 700 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. I'll now provide some quick highlights of first quarter of 2017 results and thoughts on our full-year 2017 outlook. In my remarks, all references to growth are on an organic year-over-year constant-currency basis unless otherwise specified. Our first quarter revenue growth of 9% was once again broad based across businesses and regions, with strong execution by global teams. Most of our businesses continued to post consistent organic revenue growth that is faster than the market, with MedSurg growing 12%, Cardiovascular 8%, and Rhythm Management 8%. We also delivered strong balance growth across geographies, led by 11% revenue growth in the U.S., 8% in EMEA, and 7% in Europe. Now, while emerging market revenue growth slowed 12% due to several factors, our businesses in China turned in another great quarter of 20% growth and we remain bullish on our emerging markets outlook, both in the near and long term. Turning to MedSurg. The MedSurg businesses delivered organic growth of 12% in the first quarter of 2017 and 15% including EndoChoice. In Endo, we posted 9% organic growth in first quarter and 14% including EndoChoice. Endo growth is fueled by the strength of our franchise in hemostasis, pathology and imaging, to name a few. And the EndoChoice acquisition closed late in November of 2016, and we're pleased with the early results. We pursued strategic alternatives for the FUSE business that was acquired with EndoChoice and ultimately decided to discontinue sales of the FUSE System in mid-March. In other commercial milestones during the quarter, our Frankenman joint venture shipped its first locally sourced endoscopy product for the Chinese market. We began a collaboration with Northgate to jointly commercialize products to treat gallstones in conjunction with our SpyGlass platform. Our urology and pelvic health business continued the strong performance, growing at 15% in first quarter, led by sales of products for men's health, kidney stones and pelvic floor. Emerging market sales in urology and pelvic health were very strong, and ongoing launch of LithoVue continues to go extremely well. LithoVue is now in over 700 accounts worldwide and provides single-use digital visualization and navigation capabilities to diagnose and treat stones and other conditions of the kidney ureter, while avoiding the need for repairs or sterilization that can be a challenge for reusable scopes. We look forward to the presentation of additional clinical and cost effectiveness evidence supporting LithoVue at the AUA Annual Meeting next month. In neuromodulation, revenue grew 17% in first quarter, led by strong growth in the U.S. and the international markets. U.S. growth rates of the patients trialing our spinal cord stim technology remains solid and European uptake of our Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation System has been very promising. We continue to expect to launch in the U.S. DBS market by year-end 2017. Our cardiovascular groups grew 8% in the first quarter of 2017 against tough double-digit comps in first quarter of 2016. Peripheral interventions grew 7% in the quarter, led by sales of our stent portfolio, Drug-Eluting Eluvia Stents, WALLSTENTs, and next-gen SFA Innova Stent. AngioJet Ultra Thrombectomy device used to treat deep vein thrombosis also grew nicely in the quarter. Importantly, in Drug-Eluting technologies, we executed upon two key clinical milestones in the quarter. First, we completed enrollment for the IMPERIAL IDE for our Eluvia Drug-Eluting Stent. And secondly, we began enrollment in the IDE for our Ranger drug-coated balloon. And just this week on Tuesday, we presented 12-month results for a Ranger DCB first-in-human trial at the Charing Cross Meeting, with a compelling 12-month primary patency rate of 86% and 91% freedom from TLR. Our Interventional Cardiology business continued its above-market growth trend, delivering 8% growth in the quarter. IC growth was led worldwide by continued strength in Drug-Eluting Stents, PCI Guidance, complex PCI and structural heart. And despite a 13% year-over-year comparison, Global DES sales grew low-single digits globally in the quarter, led by our differentiated SYNERGY platform. PCI Guidance grew double digits, with particular strength in IVUS, and we're encouraged by customer response to our COMET wire and fractional flow reserve platform. IC performance was also fueled by our Structural Heart business, which includes the LOTUS aortic valve and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device. It is expected to contribute approximately $250 million of revenue in 2017. Importantly, our LOTUS remediation work remains on track, and we are reiterating our guidance for a fourth quarter 2017 return to the European market and submission of our U.S. PMA, as well as an estimated mid-2018 U.S. launch. We look forward to presenting REPRISE III pivotal study results at EuroPCR in just two weeks. And we will present RESPOND extension data on LOTUS with Depth Guard, which we expect will provide insight into further reducing LOTUS pacemaker rates. We also remain on track to close the Symetis acquisition by the end of this quarter. We're extremely excited to add this highly innovative and complementary valve to LOTUS and provide a broader TAVR portfolio for varying physician and patient needs. We truly believe that our company will be uniquely and ideally positioned to address the needs of both TAVR physicians and patients with this comprehensive portfolio offering. The WATCHMAN program also had a strong quarter. It continues to build global momentum. We ended 2016 with more than 200 U.S. WATCHMAN centers and expect to close 2017 with approximately 350 centers. We also achieved two important clinical milestones with WATCHMAN. First, we enrolled our first patients in both ASAP-TOO, the study examining the use of WATCHMAN in warfarin-ineligible patients, and in SALUTE, a trial specifically designed to pursue regulatory approval in Japan. So, overall, we're pleased with our progress in Structural Heart. And please join us for an update and webcast on our Structural Heart programs at EuroPCR on May 16 at 10 :00 AM Eastern. Shifting to Rhythm Management. Global CRM sales grew well above market, at 8%, with Brady up over 20% and Tachy delivering low-single digit global growth. This strength reflects continued share gains with our ACCOLADE MRI Brady platform, strong global growth in EMBLEM S-ICD and promising early uptake of our new RESONATE platform in Europe. The RESONATE family of ICDs and CRT-Ds now launching in Europe brings multi-site pacing \u2013 multi-point pacing to our CRT products, as well as updated best-in-class longevity labeling via our EnduraLife Batteries across all families of high-voltage devices. The RESONATE platform also offers compatibility with the first and only validated heart failure predictive diagnostic in HeartLogic. And while the battery longevity of our competitors' products often limit physician appetite for program multi-point pacing due to the associated battery drain, we have seen strong early European adoption in our RESONATE launch, as patients can benefit from the programming right at implantation given our superior longevity capability. Turning to Electrophysiology. We grew sales 9% in the quarter, led by improved uptake of our new RHYTHMIA HDx platform. We continue to rollout the HDx platform in Europe and expect to launch in the U.S. late second quarter. Initially, we're continuing to expand the toolkit that supports RHYTHMIA, providing ablation technologies that match the excellence of our Mapping System, and adding tools that expand the reach and utility of RHYTHMIA in different procedure types. Finally, I'd also like to point out the significant gross margin drop-through in Rhythm Management from the sales upside, with a 530 basis point year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating margin for the Rhythm Management segment. Also, please join us for an update and webcast on our Rhythm Management programs at HRS on May 11 at 5 :00 p.m. Eastern. And finally, before turning the call over to Dan, I want to thank our employees for their winning spirit and commitment to Advancing Science for Life. Dan will now provide a detailed review of our financials. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Mike. First quarter consolidated reported revenue of $2.160 billion represents 10% growth on both an operational and reported basis. The contributions from the EndoChoice acquisition was approximately 90 basis points, which was higher than our guidance of 70 basis points as a result of over-performance of the pathology business. Even adjusting for this additional contribution from EndoChoice, we nicely exceeded our revenue growth guidance range of 6% to 8%. This strong top line also reflects a $7 million headwind from foreign exchange, which is $13 million, or approximately 65 basis points less than the $20 million headwind expected at the time of guidance. We delivered Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $0.29, representing 3% year-over-year growth and at the low end of our guidance range of $0.29 to $0.31. Importantly, this includes approximately $0.03 of charges related to our LOTUS Valve System voluntary field action and net operating losses related to the FUSE business. Excluding these $0.03 of inventory and other charges, we would have otherwise been at or above the high end of our guidance range. And I'll provide more details on the charges shortly. Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 70.6% compared to 72.3% in Q1 last year, and includes a year-over-year negative 140 basis point impact from foreign exchange. As a result of the global voluntary recall of the LOTUS Valve System initiated in February, we recorded inventory-related and other charges in the first quarter. In addition, while we pursued strategic alternatives for the FUSE business acquired with the EndoChoice acquisition, we incurred net operating losses associated with FUSE until we chose to discontinue all FUSE System sales in mid-March. These two items negatively impacted the gross margin line by approximately 180 basis points in the first quarter. Absent these charges, gross margin would have been nearly at the midpoint of our guidance range, despite the higher than expected FX headwind. We continue to implement the identified solution to fix the manufacturing process related to the LOTUS Valve deployment pin, which includes a combination of minor process and specification changes. We believe we are on track to re-enter the European market and submit our U.S. PMA in the fourth quarter of this year. As you would expect, the field action will create negative absorption headwinds in our gross margin, but we plan to offset the impact going forward and now expect our full-year gross margin to be in the range of 72% to 72.5% as a result of the LOTUS and FUSE drags this quarter. This guidance range now assumes a negative FX impact of 90 basis points for the full year. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $780 million or 36.1% of sales in Q1, up 60 basis points year-over-year. Recall that in Q1 of 2016, our SG&A rate of 35.5% of sales was lower than the remainder of 2016, as the medical device excise tax was suspended and we had not yet begun to reinvest it fully in Q1. Although we spent the entire amount of the benefit in 2016, the majority of that reinvestment took place in Q2 through Q4. As a result, the low Q1 2016 SG&A rate reflected essentially a timing benefit of delayed reinvestment spend and operating margin rates thus benefited. In the quarter, our SG&A includes additional commissions as a result of the strong sales performance, accelerated levels of investment for the U.S. DBS launch planned for the end of the year, investments in our Structural Heart commercial capabilities and slightly higher than planned litigation charges, among other factors. Though we're not pleased with our SG&A rate of 36.1% for the quarter, we expect the rate to decline over the course of the year as we continue to realize the benefit of our targeted initiatives focused on reducing SG&A and make progress on our margin expansion targets. As a result, we continue to expect our full-year 2017 adjusted SG&A rate to be in a range of 35% to 36%, which at the midpoint would represent a decrease of 60 basis points versus the full year 2016. Adjusted research and development expenses were $232 million in the first quarter or 10.8% of sales, which is roughly flat year-over-year. We now expect full-year adjusted R&D in a range of 10% to 11%. Royalty expense was 0.8% of sales in Q1, down slightly from 1% in the first quarter of last year. We expect our royalty rate to remain at approximately 1% of sales for 2017. Q1 2017 adjusted operating margin of 23% decreased 210 basis points year-over-year and was below our guidance range of 25% to 26% due primarily to the 190 basis points of charges recorded in connection with the LOTUS Valve System voluntary field action and FUSE business, as well the pattern of medical device excise tax reinvestment in 2016 that I mentioned. We do not expect any additional charges related to the LOTUS field action, and the losses incurred in Q1 2017 for the FUSE business will not recur going forward. Excluding these charges, operating margin would have been 24.9%. And if we had delivered at the mid-point of our SG&A guidance range, adjusted operating margin would have been at the mid-point of our guidance range. Now turning to segment operating margin results. The Rhythm Management team delivered an adjusted operating margin of 18.8% for Q1. This represents a very strong year-over-year adjusted operating margin increase of 530 basis points. Note, this comparison is to restated segment margins due to changes in our constant currency reporting. To give you more detail on this restatement, we use an internally derived standard currency exchange rate for our constant currency sales and reporting segment results. This standard FX approach is designed to give a more consistent long-term view of results. Given the recent periods of volatile exchange rate fluctuations, we've seen larger differences between these internal standard FX rates and the actual foreign exchange rates. As a result, we updated our internally derived standard currency exchange rates beginning on January 1, 2017 to align more closely with current actual rates. While this update obviously does not impact total company margins, it does impact our segment margins results, as the process basically reallocates FX impacts away from our corporate expenses and currency exchange line and into the operating income allocated to the reportable segments. Operationally, the Rhythm Management team continues to make strong progress on gross margin, focus on expense control and leverage the improved top-line performance of the global business, as evidenced by the more than 500 basis point improvement year-over-year this quarter. The rate of improvement for Rhythm Management for the full year 2017 remains unchanged, as we continue to look to add over 200 basis points to the segment's adjusted operating margin with a restated full-year adjusted operating margin target of 18%. Operational improvements in the Cardiovascular segment adjusted operating margin were more than offset by the LOTUS-related charges in the first quarter, for a net decrease of 340 basis points year-over-year. For MedSurg, the adjusted operating margin decreased over prior year by 90 basis points, driven by the FUSE net operating losses and forward investments as we prepare for our expected U.S. deep brain stimulation launch at the end of the year. Now I'll move on to other income and expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $57 million, roughly flat to Q1 of last year. Our average interest expense rate was 4% in Q1 of this year compared to 3.9% in Q1 of last year. In January, we used our existing credit facilities to refinance the $250 million of our senior notes due in January 2017, and we have no remaining debt obligations for 2017. Other expense was $2 million in the first quarter. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 4.9% on a reported basis and 9.2% on an adjusted basis. In the quarter, we recorded an income tax benefit of $28 million related to the adoption of the new stock compensation accounting standard, which was a greater benefit than previously anticipated due to the upward movement of our stock price. We expect this benefit represents the majority of excess tax benefit in 2017 due to the annual vesting of our awards during the first quarter. We're now expecting a 175 basis point benefit to our full-year effective tax rate from the change in stock compensation accounting, which is 50 basis points greater than previously anticipated. Excluding this benefit, we still expect our operational tax rate to be approximately 14%, but given the 50 basis point favorability from the change in stock compensation accounting, we now expect the full-year adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 12.5% to 13%. Finally, Q1 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $0.29 includes approximately $0.02 of unfavorable foreign exchange and represents 3% year-over-year growth, or 9% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This $0.29 also includes the approximate $0.03 of charges related to our LOTUS Valve System voluntary field action and FUSE net operating losses. On a reported GAAP basis, which includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $107 million after tax, Q1 2017 EPS was $0.21. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $171 million compared to $250 million in Q1 last year. In the quarter, we used cash primarily to fund previously agreed upon legal settlements as well as business development activities. And as of March 31, 2017, we had cash on hand of $156 million. Capital expenditures for the first quarter totaled $112 million, as we execute on our plans to make additional investments in SYNERGY manufacturing equipment due to higher volumes as well as campus consolidation and plant network optimization activities. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the full year to be approximately $300 million. In addition, during the quarter, we continued working through the mesh litigation-related settlement evaluation process and have reached conditional, final or near-final settlement now on over 37,000 of our approximately 43,000 known claims. Having now settled or reached agreement in principle with over three quarters of all outstanding claims, we continue to reduce the risk on our balance sheet and are targeting a resolution of the majority of our remaining mesh claims in 2018. Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $1.751 billion as of March 31, 2017. We ended Q1 with 1.390 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding and we expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.390 billion for Q2 and 1.392 billion for the full year 2017. I'll now walk through the guidance for Q2 and the full year 2017. For the full year, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $8.800 billion to $8.900 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 6% to 7% on an operational basis, including an approximately 70 basis point contribution from EndoChoice, and 5% to 6% on a reported basis. We expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $85 million for the full year 2017. We continue to expect full-year 2017 adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.22 to $1.26, representing 10% to 13% adjusted earnings growth and continue to assume the full-year negative impact of FX will be approximately $0.08. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share to be in a range of $0.81 to $0.86. Now turning to Q2 2017. We expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $2.185 billion to $2.215 billion. This represents year-over-year growth in a range of 5% to 6% operationally, including the approximate 70 basis point contribution from EndoChoice. We expect the foreign exchange impact on Q2 revenue to be a $35 million headwind. For the second quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.30 to $0.32 per share, representing 11% to 18% adjusted earnings growth. GAAP earnings per share for the second quarter is expected to be in a range of $0.18 to $0.21 per share. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q1 2017 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q1 results, as well as Q2 and full-year 2017 guidance, including P&L line item guidance. So, with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A. Susan Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Dan. Kevin, let's open it up for the next 30 minutes or so. Please go ahead. Operator : Thank you. First question. David Lewis, Morgan Stanley, please go ahead. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Good morning. Congrats on, again, great revenue performance. Mike, just a quick question for you and then a follow-up for Dan. So, Mike, just wondered if you could focus this morning on the two businesses which saw the greatest acceleration from our model, and those basically were U.S. Interventional and Endoscopy. Why don't you just talk about the factors underpinning that performance and the sustainability across the balance of the year? And then, Dan, for you, I think you did a great job talking about these factors impacting first quarter margins. But could you talk just about second quarter gross margin trends, just to give people some confidence that the margin plan is back on track here as we get to the second quarter and beyond post-LOTUS? Thanks so much. Nice quarter. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Dave. Good morning. Just broadly on interventional cardiology and then I'll touch on endo. We've discussed at a few different Investor Days, and Kevin Ballinger, just our overall goal of continuing to diversify and strengthen in the faster growth markets in the Interventional Cardiology business. We've already seen the benefit of that with our DES business continuing to grow faster than market despite very difficult comps, the broadening and further impact of our complex coronary IVUS and FFR business. And then the third leg of the stool there in cardiology is our Structural Heart, where we remain on track to deliver the $250 million this year, really fueled by WATCHMAN, given the impact of the LOTUS recall. And we look forward to getting that product back in the market. So really that stronger balance of businesses within that Cardiology business are leading us to markets that we view in a combined basis are quite healthy, and we're growing faster than the market across those areas. So we do have some tough comps coming up with DES for the remainder of the year, but we continue to believe the competitive positioning in DES is really a strength of us, given some of the challenges we're seeing with others in the marketplace. And we expect to continue to grow there while growing WATCHMAN, our complex bag as well as getting LOTUS back on the market. And we're excited to close the Symetis deal hopefully in June. On Endo, that business continues to really deliver excellent performance. You'll be excited to see at the Investor Day the strategy to broaden that business out into exciting new adjacencies going forward. But, again, a strong growth market. We're taking share, led by SpyGlass. The EndoChoice acquisition is working well, moving us into pathology. Strong growth in the emerging markets. And really again just a strong cadence of products with our Resolution hemostasis capabilities, as well as our EUS Endoscopic Ultrasound. So the portfolio and expansion into global markets continues to fuel our Endo business. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. David. And on your Q2 gross margin question, it's really pretty straight forward. Q1 gross margin was 70.6%. And at the midpoint of Q2 guidance, we'd be at 72.5%. The delta there is 190 basis points. And really the elimination of the LOTUS and FUSE charges of 180 basis points gets you right to the midpoint of where we should be in Q2. So, saw good operational improvements in Q1 that those should continue in Q2 and feel good about the guidance for Q2 in gross margin. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks, guys. Great quarter. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, David. Operator : All right. Next question is from the line of Michael Weinstein, JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. And good morning. So let me just start on a couple of the (30:14) businesses. Endoscopy and Urology both had fantastic quarters. In both cases, the comps get harder from here. So can you just give us your view on sustainability of growth rates? So we're not necessarily talking about what you put up this quarter, but above-market growth rates we got used to in 2016. Thanks. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. Good morning, Mike. Yeah, so we've taken up the full-year sales revenue guidance, as you know, 6% to 7%. So we pulled up the lower end there based on the strength of second quarter. Broadly across the company, we face 10% growth comp headwinds really for the next four quarters coming up, second quarter through first quarter 2018. But despite that, especially in Endo and Uro and across the board, one, first of all, these are strong markets, Endo and Uro, that are healthy. We have an excellent cadence of product launches, global expansion and acquisitions that are working quite well. When you look at our Urology business, the acquisition of AMS has gone extremely well. We're ahead of our synergy plan. The standalone AMS business legacy business is growing about 8%, so much faster than it was as a standalone basis. And really what's really disruptive in our Urology business is our disposable scope platform. So we're seeing strong uptake with that. We're continuing to launch that globally and it pulls through our stone business. Another big key growth driver for us in Urology is we've been underweight in the international markets historically. So we've been disproportionally investing in those markets. And that's really bearing lot of fruit. So we see continued momentum with our Uro business. We do have some tougher comps, but we expect to continue to grow faster than market. And it's kind of the same story rewound in Endo. Good growth market. We do have some difficult comps, but our portfolio cadence is a quite strong. And, again, this business we're investing quite a bit in the emerging markets and it's paying off for us. So despite the tough comps, we expect to continue to grow faster than market in both those divisions. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Perfect. Let me ask this one question related to LOTUS. And that is, when LOTUS re-launches later this year, you're going to have a challenge of bringing that product back to market that's been off the market for six months. Can you just give us your thoughts on where you think the balance between the two settles out for you as you go to 2018? What do you think the respective positions are of those two products in Europe? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah, so I'll make a comment and then I'll let Ian jump in. So the good news for us is our team in Europe \u2013 our TAVR team isn't on their hands in terms of the commercial team. They're helping out with WATCHMAN, they're helping out Cardiology. And hopefully if we close early second quarter here for Symetis, they'll begin selling that platform potentially in June, or June or July. So, we'll be back in the market in TAVR valves in Europe and then we'll follow that on with LOTUS starting in the fourth quarter. So pretty soon we'll be back in the game in TAVR. And I think, Ian, I'll turn it over to you in terms of what you see as the mix there. Ian Meredith, M.D., Ph.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Mike. And good morning, Michael. I think that we'll see that the dedicated LOTUS users will quickly take up using LOTUS once again when it's available back in Europe because of its complete repositionability and safety. So, I suspect that the mix will vary from site to site depending on the patient populations and physician preferences. But it is likely that it'll be a 50/50 mix, but it will vary from site to site. Operator : Okay. Next question is from the line of Bob Hopkins, Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Can you hear me okay? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yep. Can hear you fine, Bob. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Hey, good morning. And congrats on such strong results again. First of all, just a quick one for Dan and then a bigger picture question. For Dan, and I'm sorry if I missed this, but for the full year 2017, can you give us the sense as to what the earnings and margin impact will be for the LOTUS recall? Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. So on operating margin in Q1, it's 190 basis points for the LOTUS and FUSE charges. And then you just basically divide that by four for the full year, so it's 45 basis points on the full year. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then from a bigger picture perspective, when we think about the upcoming data release here in a couple of weeks, I was wondering if, Ian, I could just get you to comment on a couple of things because there's been some discussion on previous calls on setting expectations for this trial, especially as it relates to stroke rates. So if you could just sort of set the stage for us for REPRISE III and any issues that you think you should point out in terms of comparability or what we've seen in previously trials and, therefore, how should we putting these results in perspective, would be really helpful. So just any comments on the upcoming data in REPRISE III and how we should be thinking about the trial data, given what we've seen from previous data sets. Thank you. Ian Meredith, M.D., Ph.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thank you. It's a very good question. Obviously, we can't comment on the data release prior to presentation at EuroPCR. And that presentation, of course, will take place at 12 :30 on the 16th of May. We sincerely hope that you tune in for that. I think it's fair to comment on the trial, that it is the largest global randomized trial head-to-head platform of two TAVR devices with all the bells and whistles of a high-quality trial. So joint comparisons with other studies is probably not that wise. And I think we should wait for the data to fully understand what this dataset will mean. I think we could comment on what we expect the pacemaker rate to be. As you know from previous trials, we have observed a higher pacemaker rate, and one would expect that this trial having been completed in December 2015, when you follow up to December 2016. Before we were fully aware of all of the drivers that determined pacemaker rate, one would expect that the pacemaker rate would be in some ways comparable to what we've seen previously. Then with respect to all of the other variables, I think we have to actually weigh this trial on its merits, given that this is a large head-to-head comparison randomized on an even playing field. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks. Any follow-on questions there? Ian Meredith, M.D., Ph.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.: Okay. Operator : Next question is from Rick Wise, Stifel. Please go ahead. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Hi, Rick. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: First, Dan, a question for you on SG&A. You very clearly called out some of the moving pieces, litigation, some investments. But I'm a little confused. You said you weren't pleased with SG&A even when you normalize. And you weren't pleased because of the higher investment, you weren't pleased because of the timing or the impact of the cost reduction programs. Just help us understand your thinking and some of the drivers of the better SG&A going forward? Thank you. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure, Rick. Yeah, and I think you've delineated some of the reasons in Q1. I think the reason for the dissatisfaction is we missed the range. The range was 35% to 36%. We hit 36.1%. That doesn't add up to success from my perspective for that number in the quarter. Now, the reasons are there. We're obviously happy to invest in USB brain stimulation. We needed to pay the extra commissions, all the factors that are there. And that number should come down over the rest of the year with the programs that we have in place. But the dissatisfaction comment is really just for the fact that, in the quarter, I would have liked to have rather seen that at the midpoint and it ended up a tick above the high end of the range. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And, Mike, just turning back to CRM side of things. Heart Rhythm Society is coming up. Maybe you or Dr. Meredith want to talk about some of the messages or key events there. But maybe you could talk specifically, Mike, about growth. I mean, you had amazing growth on the CRM side, pacer growth outlook. Now you're anniversarying that. RHYTHMIA seems set with the HDx next-gen launch to be a growth driver. But maybe talk us through some of these many moving pieces, and I'm just talking about a couple, that are going to sustain the kind of growth we're seeing? Or do you think it could accelerate? What are you focused on over the next six months, 12 months? Thank you. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Rick. And I'll have Dr. Stein comment on HRS. But just a couple of comments on CRM. Really proud of the team there. Continued another quarter of above-market growth globally, plus 8% in a challenging market. And really encouraged by a couple of points. One, is our Brady platform continues to do extremely well. Based on the quality of that product, the deliverability, the quality of the lead. So excellent job in Brady. Defib continues to gain share. And really we're seeing a strong uptake continuing, especially in the international markets, with S-ICD, particularly in Japan. Excellent growth there. And we launched a new product called our RESONATE in Europe that is an excellent product that helps with the multipoint pacing capability, the extended battery longevity. And also on top of that, what is a great proof point, and we talk about healthcare economics and so forth, the NICE recommendation that came out in the UK that really proves out the exceptional longevity benefits that we have in our ICD, CRT-D platforms, the cost savings that delivers and the patient impact supported by nine separate independent publications really shows the true economic benefit and the value of our CRM products. And I think that data is well respected and making its way around the world, which is helping us. Dr. Stein, if you want to comment a bit on what's coming at HRS. Kenneth Stein - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. And, Rick, thanks for the question. A couple of data releases that I want to highlight for HRS. First, two late-breaking trial presentations. One is the first readout on data from our S-ICD post-approval study in the U.S. So that was an FDA-mandated trial of over 1,600 patients implanted with this system, post-commercialization. And we'll be presenting the acute safety data as well as a good look at the demographics of who is actually getting the device in the U.S. and their acute outcomes. And then in addition, a WATCHMAN late-breaker which presents the one-year follow-up results of our EVOLUTION trial, which is large 1,000-patient prospective registry of WATCHMAN implantation in Europe. And I'd be remiss if I didn't also point out that we have a follow-on WATCHMAN late-breaker to that at EuroPCR, which focuses specifically on the warfarin contraindicated patients in that cohort. And that may be very helpful as you look towards what we think we're going to see in our randomized ACEP II trial. The only other things that I'd point out a large number of abstracts from our EP group, looking at some of the newer technologies that we're evaluating for our ablation catheters and with RHYTHMIA and two more abstracts on our upcoming leadless pacemaker looking specifically at how it works in concert with the S-ICD. Operator : And next question is from the line of Danielle Antalffy, Leerink. Please go ahead. Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on another great quarter. Wondering if you can update us on the regulatory timelines for the MRI-safe high-power devices and how we should think about the share shifts that should occur there once they do come to market. You've got a competitor that's supposed to be coming to market, but that's unclear given some of their regulatory issues. So just wondering how to think about that. You've been gaining share with the MRI-safe pacer. Should we see a similar type of shift when the high-power devices come to market? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Good. I'll take it. And, Dr. Stein, please comment. We talked, Susie, fourth quarter this year? Susan Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: Year end. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Year end. Ideally by year end, approval of our MRI compatibility with our ICD, which really will be combined on the RESONATE platform, which is really meaningful because no you have multipoint pacing, extended battery longevity and the future MRI compatibility and also a diagnostics tool called HeartLogic. So it's really a differentiated platform for the long run for us. And also we anticipate, as we talked in the past, in 2018, we've seen a slight improvement in our replacement headwind in 2017, and we expect to see a bit more of it in 2018. So, overall, it's a tough market, but we continue to expect to grow faster than the market. I don't know, Ken, if you have any additional comments? Kenneth Stein - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. I think I'd just reiterate what Mike said. We are on track according to that timeline that Mike gave you in terms of when we're anticipating approval. Obviously, we can't comment on when we think the competitor is going to get through their regulatory issues and get their approval. Certainly on the pacing side, we've seen a very big impact and a very positive impact from our MRI labeling with the INGEVITY device there. One of the thing that's unique about our regulatory strategy on the high-voltage devices is this backwards compatibility, where we expect once we get labeling that it would not only be for the new generation devices, as Mike mentioned, RESONATE, but for the vast majority of devices that are currently being implanted in the U.S. And I think as you look at what might happen once you get approval, it's important to recognize that already a good number of customers believe our backwards compatibility story and do believe that it is likely that, with approval, we'll have the backwards compatibility for the systems they're implanting today. We've been able to execute that strategy in Europe. We've executed that strategy in the U.S. with the EMBLEM S-ICD. So I think we have a lot of credibility when it comes to that. Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. And then just one quick follow-up, if I could. We talked a lot about on the call the MedSurg, the growth, sustainability a little in cardiology. But just taking a step back and if you look across all the businesses, you've been growing above the market. Granted, comps get a little bit tougher over the course of the year. But, quite frankly, Q1 of last year was a tough comp as well across all of your businesses. And actually, comps for CRM are not as tough. So I'm just curious, and I appreciate you raised the low end of the sales growth guidance range, but why can't you grow even faster? What do you have coming in the pipeline that could continue this growth momentum? Thanks so much. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. We're certainly pleased with our performance for the last few years. And besides the top line, as we've noted multiple times, the continued opportunity to improve margins faster than our peers to combine it with the top-line growth. So we're pleased with the 6% to 7% guidance for the full year. It's faster than market and it does reflect the reality that we do have 10% growth comp headwinds for the next four quarters. So I think that's a prudent and reasonable guidance range to give, given that comparison headwind. We do have some particular anniversary of some tough comps, particularly with SYNERGY, which will be 12% comps in 2016. So really that the bigger challenge is comps, and some comps with Interventional Cardiology. Plus, we're off the market in LOTUS until fourth quarter, so that's a bit of a headwind for us. But despite that, we're pleased with the 6% to 7% guidance. And then moving forward, we have an Investor Day coming up in June. And I think you'll like that event. You'll see a strategy and a pipeline that will continue to drive revenue growth over the LRP time period faster than our peer group and OI improvement faster than the peer group. And so I think you'll be really comfortable with the strength of Boston Scientific over that LRP program. And consistent with the past, we continue to beat those LRP commitments we've done historically. Operator : And next question is from the line of Chris Pasquale, Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks. First, just wanted to clarify. Does the updated guidance include Symetis? And, if so, what are you assuming for a revenue contribution this year? Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: It does not include Symetis. We wouldn't include that until the acquisition actually closes in Q2. So look for that to be post-close. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. Perfect. And then Peripheral had another solid quarter, but the U.S. PCI business did slow a bit and continues to lag behind international. You highlighted the progress you made in the ELUVIA and Ranger clinical trials. Could you just remind us what you're thinking in terms of potential FDA approval timing for those products? And how do you sustain momentum in U.S. Peripheral while you wait for them to get here? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Absolutely. So in Peripheral, we had a strong quarter overall at 7% growth. We had tough comp at 14% growth comp comparison for last year, but again grew at 7%. Stronger, as you pointed out, in the international markets, where we have our Ranger Balloon as well as the ELUVIA Stents, which is really providing some significant differentiation for us in capabilities there. You saw the Ranger data just came out that we referenced. In terms of approval times for Ranger, we just enrolling that clinical trial just this quarter. And so we'll likely have FDA approval in 2020/2021, so depends on the enrolment speed. In terms of ELUVIA, we expect that ideally the back half of 2019 or 2020. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks. Operator : And next question is from the line of Vijay Kumar, Evercore. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Hey, guys. Congratulations on a really nice quarter here. Just maybe, Dan, I had one on the guidance, the 2Q revenue guidance. And I had one follow-up for Mike. I guess if you look at the second quarter organic revenue guidance, so we're looking at a 400 basis points sequential deceleration. I know that the comps are tougher. But apart from the comps and maybe LOTUS being pulled off, is there any else that we should be looking for the 2Q organic guidance? Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: No, Vijay. I think Mike covered that pretty well relative to the comps. So you think of Q1 we had an 8% comp for the total company, Q2 we have 10%, so that's 200 basis points right there. And then specific to some Q2 anniversarying launches from last year, the SYNERGY launch in U.S. branch in Japan was Q1 really last year. And then the CRM product launches in Quad and MRI-safe Brady were Q2 early and late. And then we also we had the Uro pelvic health share gains from a competitor exiting the market in Q2. So really happy to be taking share there, and it's a very nice boost to the overall Urology business, but we anniversary that as well. So I think it stacks up pretty well overall when you look at that guidance for Q2 and for the full year. But it really is a story of comps. And I think we still have good momentum in the business. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Does that comp, I guess does it assume competition launching their own stents in second quarter? Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Does it assume what? Sorry. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Does it assume new competitive entrants within the stent market for the Q2 guidance? Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yes. We do see some competitive activity in USDS with some potential competitive launches. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. And then, Mike, one quick one for you. There's some speculation in the market on LOTUS when it comes to the PMA submission. And the debate is, what is the FDA's motivation to accept the PMA given the recall? Or would they ask for a small safety 30-day follow-up kind of study? I'm just curious, have you had this conversation with the FDA and can you confirm whether they've asked you for such a safety study or not? Thank you. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah, I'll turn it over to Dr. Meredith. Ian Meredith, M.D., Ph.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Mike. So we have a plan to discuss some of the FDA coming up. It is inappropriate to foreshadow what the FDA will actually require. But one suspects that there will be a small Pinnacle study required to confirm that the Pinnacle issue has been resolved. But it's unlikely that that study will be substantial. Operator : Okay. Next question is from the line of Matt Taylor, Barclays. Please go ahead. Ian Mahmud - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. This is Ian Mahmud on for Matt. Can you hear me okay? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yep. Hear you fine. Ian Mahmud - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Okay. Good morning. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Good morning. Ian Mahmud - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So I just want to ask about WATCHMAN. And I know you've commented on some, but just on the trials you highlighted. Can you discuss what expanded label in the U.S. might mean for the market? Have you provided any guidance in terms of timing of those two trials? Kenneth Stein - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. I can take that, Mike, if you let me. So I think that there were sort of three different trials we highlighted here over the fall. I think probably the one that's the most interesting and the most direct to your question is the ASAP-TOO trial. And so ASAP-TOO is a large, global, multi-center randomized trial looking specifically at the use of WATCHMAN in patients who are currently off-label in the U.S. And that is those who are deemed by their physicians to be ineligible for even short-term use of warfarin, which is required on a U.S. label post-implant. We've started enrollment in the trial. I don't think we can go any further publicly at this point in terms of when we expect that enrollment to complete. It is an adaptive trial design and so there is really a lot of play around when that trial might complete its primary endpoint. In terms of the impact, really what that would do would be to bring our labeling in the U.S. to be consistent with our labeling in our CE Mark countries. So, our CE Mark labeling devices continues with both the warfarin-eligible and warfarin-ineligible patients. And, again, I can't get out ahead of the data, but I would point it to our EVOLUTION data releases coming up at HRS and at EuroPCR, where I think you can get a better look at the different characteristics of those two cohorts. Ian Mahmud - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got you. Okay, helpful. Thank you. Operator : Okay. Next question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. One on the quarter and one on Structural Heart. So you initially guided to I think 5.3% to 7.5% in Q1, and you did 10%. So my question is, what was better than expected, what drove that? I mean, that's pretty impressive upside. And, second, Mike, big picture, do you still expect to accelerate in 2018 over the 5.3% to 6.3% I think organic guidance that you're giving for 2017? And I did have one follow-up. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thank you. Yeah. So we had a quarter that was quite strong. I would say, what surprised us, one, is that the performance of the MedSurg business was very strong. And that was, quite frankly, up more than we thought, given the strength of Neuromod business, Uro and Endo contributing 12% organic growth. So that that was a bit of a surprise to us, especially coming off what was a 11% comp for the whole sector first quarter 2016. So just terrific execution across all three of those businesses and global expansion. So that was a bit of a surprise. The other one was we knew CRM and Rhythm Management was going to do well, but we weren't planned on them doing an 8%. So, kudos to that team. They just delivered excellent results. And they deserve to, because they have the best battery longevity and an excellent product. So that was a surprise for us to the positive. And we're also really pleased with \u2013 very excited about the future with the Symetis acquisition in combination with LOTUS. And coming out of a meeting in California this week with a bunch of cardiologists, there is lot of enthusiasm for the unique capability of Symetis and LOTUS combined, and how to help treat patients and also to serve customers. So very bullish on that. In terms of going forward, given the strong outlook that we provided, 6% to 7% for the full year, which is stronger than market, we'll clearly provide 2018 guidance in the future. And as I mentioned before, I think what you'll see at Investor Day is a company with a very clear strategy, with a deep pipeline that will continue to grow faster than market in our LRP period. And we've got a lot of room to improve margins, as you know, and deliver the EPS growth. So you'll see that Investor Day. And we'll continue to deliver on those three elements of our plan. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : That's very helpful. And then just for a follow-up for Mike or Ian. We haven't heard much regarding your strategy in either mitral or tricuspid. Do you have anything new to share in these fronts? How are you thinking about those two areas, given the recent doubling down with Symetis in the TAVR market? Thanks for taking the questions. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah, so we've clearly doubled down in TAVR given the strength of that market, the uniqueness of our products and the commercial capabilities that we have. So that's the bet that we've made is doubling down in what we think will be a $4 billion to $5 billion market in 2020. And we're clearly doubled down with our WATCHMAN platform. You're going to see more, not only the clinical trials that Ken outlined, but also more direct-to-patient marketing to continue to expand that marketplace. We also, on the mitral and tricuspid area, we do have multiple minority equity bets in multiple companies. Quite frankly, we see that mitral opportunity as exciting, but much slower to develop versus the TAVR market, and a business that's likely more segmented out in terms of the number of devices to be acquired. So we like the market. We're going to continue to invest in it with our VC bets. But the primary focus is on TAVR and WATCHMAN. Also trying to clarify on the PI side on the ELUVIA, we estimate that the FDA approval to be second half of 2019, potentially first quarter of 2020, but we estimate second half of 2019. And our Ranger, we haven't given any timing yet. We just started enrolling this quarter. Susan Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Mike. With that, we would like to conclude the call.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q2 2017 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call, to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information. The duration of our call will be approximately one hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights of Q2 2017. Dan will review the financials for the quarter, and then Q3 2017 and full-year 2017 guidance. And then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith and Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, organic revenue growth is defined as excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from the acquisition of EndoChoice and Symetis over the relevant prior-year period.

They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q3 and full-year 2017 guidance, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend, and other expenses. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Thanks, Mike. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thank you, Susie, and good morning, everyone. Boston Scientific delivered strong results again in second quarter 2017, organic revenue growth up 6% and operational revenue growth up 7%. We're ahead of both expectations and underlying market growth rates. It was an excellent quarter in light of a challenging 10% organic revenue growth comparison in second quarter of 2016. These results are also a reflection of our strong execution and success of our category leadership strategy. We leveraged that 7% revenue growth to deliver 18% adjusted EPS growth, or $0.32 per share and $0.01 above Wall Street Consensus. If you exclude the $0.02 negative impact of foreign exchange, adjusted EPS grew 24% year-over-year. Key to this very high level of EPS growth was a 260 basis point year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating margin to 26%, led by a strong 72.8% gross margin result, and a 40 basis point reduction year-over-year in SG&A spending to 35.5% of revenue. Also, as detailed at our Investor Day last month, we aim to deliver this type of consistent revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth over the long term. We continue to enhance the growth profile of the company, with plans to enter into $13 billion in new high-growth markets across our businesses over the next few years. Importantly, we believe Boston Scientific continues to be uniquely positioned to drive shareholder value and differentiated EPS growth due to our revenue growth profile, opportunity to improve operating margins, and a strengthening balance sheet. We're also excited about the second half of 2017 and our plans to build upon our global momentum, and drive sustainable long-term growth in 2018 and beyond. We're raising our full-year 2017 operational revenue growth guidance to an estimated 7% growth with a 6% to 8% range, which includes an approximate 120 basis point full-year contribution from the EndoChoice and Symetis acquisitions. We're also raising our full-year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.01 from the previous range of $1.22 to $1.26, to a revised range of $1.23 to $1.27, representing 11% to 14% earnings growth. Importantly, this revised EPS guidance includes an expected $0.08 negative impact, or approximate 700 basis point headwind, from foreign exchange. I'll now provide some highlights on Q2 2017 results and thoughts on our second-half 2017 outlook. In my remarks, all references to growth are on organic, year-over-year, constant-currency basis unless otherwise specified. Our Q2 organic revenue growth of 6% continues to be broad based across our product lines, with most of our businesses growing faster than the underlying markets. MedSurg grew an impressive 10%, Cardiovascular 5%, and Rhythm Management 3%. We also delivered a strong balanced organic growth across geographies, led by 7% revenue growth in the U.S. and EMEA, 14% in emerging markets, and 20% growth specifically in China. In Europe, our business was impacted from the LOTUS recall, yet they still delivered 2% growth in the quarter. Turning to a few MedSurg highlights, the three MedSurg businesses delivered an impressive 10% organic revenue growth and 12% operational growth, including the recently acquired EndoChoice. In Endoscopy, organic revenue grew 7% in the quarter, and 12% including acquisition, led by the strength of our franchises in hemostasis, pathology and endoluminal surgery. Of note, in hemostasis we're seeing faster-than-expected conversion to our new Resolution 360 Clip platform, which led to mid-teens growth for the franchise. Regionally, Endo results were particularly strong in the U.S. and Latin America. Seven months after closing the EndoChoice acquisition, we have completed the sales integration, and revenue is slightly ahead of plan, contributing to 80 basis points of total growth in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with the results from our expanding presence in pathology, infection control and prevention, and the Ambulatory Surgery Center market. Additionally, our recently signed agreement with Total Scope allows us to offer convenient scope repair services to this important customer base. Our Uro and Pelvic Health businesses continue the strong performance that grew 10% in the quarter, led by our single-usage digital LithoVue Ureteroscope and products to treat men's health and pelvic floor conditions. This 10% growth is particularly impressive considering an 18% growth comparison in second quarter 2016. So overall, the Uro health business grew double-digit in the U.S., EMEA, and Latin America. And the emerging markets sales were also very strong, led by our stone and men's health franchises. LithoVue remains an important driver for our Urology business, providing single-use digital visualization and navigation capability to diagnose and treat stones and other conditions of the kidney, ureter, while avoiding the needs for repairs or sterilization that can be a very big challenge with reusable scopes. LithoVue is now in more than 900 accounts worldwide, and we're seeing faster growth and pull-through of our core kidney stone business with customers that are using LithoVue. We continue to see important research studies that support the trend toward single-use systems, which bodes well for the longer term outlook. And the FDA has also recently determined that manufacturers of certain reusable medical devices now need to include validation data regarding cleaning, disinfection and sterilization. We remain very encouraged by the LithoVue opportunity. Turning to neuromod. Revenue in neuromodulation grew 14% in the second quarter, driven by multiple new product launches, including the Montage MRI System and the Artisan full-body MRI paddle and spinal cord stimulation, as well as their Vercise Gevia MRI deep brain stimulation system in Europe. Gevia features our Neural Navigator 2 with STIMVIEW Technology, which allows clinicians to visualize the stimulation field while customizing DBS stimulation programs for patients. We expect to launch into the U.S. DBS market by year-end 2017 or early 2018, followed by a traditional \u2013 followed by our directional lead in MRI conditioning label in 2018. It's really an exciting time in spinal cord stimulation, as we recently published a Lumina 24-month data, and the PROCO randomized control trial data was presented at INS. The PROCO data showed that frequency is not a determining factor in spinal cord stimulation pain relief. 1 kilohertz therapy had equivalent results to 10 kilohertz, and Boston Scientific's Precision Spectra uses 1 kilohertz, and thus uses two-thirds less energy than high frequency systems with the equivalent outcomes for pain relief. This reinforces the need and benefit for flexible technology platforms like Spectra that can enable physicians to customize therapy for the unique pain patients. Turning to our cardiovascular group, the cardiovascular group grew 5% in the second quarter of 2017 against a very tough 13% growth comparison in second quarter of 2016. So starting off with our PI business, Peripheral Interventions in the quarter grew 7%, particularly strong performance in Asia and Europe, led by sales of our stent portfolio, our next-generation Innova Stent for the SFA, Drug-Eluting Eluvia Stent in Europe, and WALLSTENT. We also saw strong growth from our Atherectomy Jetstream platform and a promising initial launch of our Opticross Intravascular Ultrasound platform for peripheral applications. Drug-Eluting technologies contributed nicely to European growth, and in the U.S., enrollment in the IDE trial for our Ranger DCB continues on pace. We also await 12-month follow-up in the IMPERIAL trial for our Eluvia Drug-Eluting Stent. In Interventional Cardiology, that business grew second quarter organic revenue 4% and operational revenue of 5%, despite the impact of the LOTUS recall in Europe. Our growth was led by strong sales of our WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device, mid-teens revenue growth in PCI guidance. mid single-digit growth in complex PCI, and early contributions from the Symetis ACURATE platform in Europe. The WATCHMAN platform had another excellent quarter and continues to build global momentum. We're focused on market development activities such as deploying therapy awareness reps, increasing our medical education programs, social media outreach, and direct-to-patient awareness programs. We remain on track in 2017 with 350 to 375 U.S. centers. We also achieved an important clinical milestone with WATCHMAN by completing enrollment in SALUTE trial. This trial is specifically designed to pursue regulatory approval in Japan. And we target mid-2019 Japan approval for WATCHMAN. Global DS sales in the quarter were up 1% despite a challenging 9% growth comparison in second quarter 2016, led by our differentiated SYNERGY platform. Products for complex PCI procedures grew in the upper mid single-digits, led by strong Atherectomy and Cutting Balloon sales. Our PCI Guidance business continues to build momentum with strong IVUS sales and the launch of our integrated fractional flow reserve platform. On LOTUS, LOTUS remediation work remains on track. We expect LOTUS to return to the EU market by year-end 2017, and a fourth quarter submission of our U.S. PMA for regulatory approval in the U.S. We continue to estimate a mid-2018 launch in the U.S. Nine weeks post-closing, we're on track with our Symetis integration plans, including training of our Euro TAVR field reps on the ACURATE valve platform. As highlighted at our recent Investor Day conference, we believe that our company will be uniquely and ideally positioned to address the needs of physicians and patients with our differentiated TAVR portfolio. There is no change to our clinical trial priorities, including pursuing ACURATE in the U.S. and Japan and a LOTUS intermediate risk indication. We will aim to provide more details of our TAVR clinical plans in the coming months. We're also very well positioned in the faster (12:57) structural heart market with our strong momentum in LAAC and potential for share-taking in TAVR, via both ACURATE and LOTUS. We're also raising our expected 2017 structural heart revenue guidance from $250 million to approximately $275 million to reflect the revenue impact from the Symetis acquisition, which closed in May. Shifting to Rhythm Management, global CRM sales grew 2%, which outpaced the challenging worldwide market growth of the industry. Our focus on Rhythm Management profitability has really paid off, resulting in extremely strong adjusted operating margin of 20.9%, which is up 720 basis points year-over-year, which Dan will detail in a few minutes. As for product trends, Brady sales grew mid-single digits and we continue to gain share. However, our growth did slow a bit from prior quarters due to the anniversary of our ACCOLADE MRI Brady platform, as well as a competitor's launch. We also saw very strong growth globally in EMBLEM S-ICD, our Quad X4 CRT-P, and encouraging initial launch feedback of our new RESONATE platform in Europe, as well as a slight uptick in CRT-D replacement cycle sales consistent with our replacement curve models. We have submitted clinical data from our navel MRI study to FDA, and continue to expect to launch our transvenous MRI-compatible high voltage system in the U.S. by year end. Turning to EP, we grew sales 13% in the quarter, led by improved uptake of our new Rhythmia HDx platform. We continue to roll out the HDx platform in Europe, and now in the U.S. and Japan. We look forward to launching our IntellaNav MiFi Open-Irrigated Catheter, Therapeutic Catheter \u2013 wow \u2013 IntellaNav MiFi Open-Irrigated Therapeutic Catheter in the EU and U.S. in third quarter, as well as beginning a limited market evaluation of our DirectSense technology in the EU, as enabled by our new software upgrade for Rhythmia. So to wrap up, Boston Scientific's portfolio strategy, our globalization efforts, and execution of our global teams, continues to work, and we continue to deliver strong and differentiated results. We believe we are poised for an exciting second half of 2017, and that we are well positioned to continue our performance track record in 2018 and beyond. I really want to thank our employees again for their winning spirit and strong commitment to the company, and Advancing Science for Life. Dan will now provide a detailed review of our financials. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Mike. Second quarter consolidated reported revenue of $2.257 billion represents 6% growth on both a reported and organic basis, and 7% on an operational basis, which excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency. This strong top line also reflects a $23 million headwind from foreign exchange, which is $12 million or approximately 55 basis points less compared to a $35 million headwind expected at the time of guidance. The contribution from the recent acquisitions was approximately 120 basis points, which was higher than our guidance of 70 basis points as a result of the strong performance of the Pathology business acquired with the EndoChoice deal, and sales from the recently closed Symetis acquisition that was not included in guidance. After adjusting for the performance of the acquisitions, we still exceeded our 5% to 6% operational guidance range on slightly stronger results from the core businesses. We delivered Q2 adjusted earnings per share of $0.32, representing 18% year-over-year growth and at the high end of our guidance range of $0.30 to $0.32. I'll walk through the details of the results and guidance in a moment, but we're pleased to have exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range, and as a result are increasing our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $1.23 to $1.27 range. Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 72.8%, compared to 70.7% in Q2 of last year, and includes a year-over-year negative 50 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter represents a 210 basis point increase over prior year, and was at the high end of our guidance range due to favorable product mix in the quarter, particularly from the strength in WATCHMAN and men's health franchises. We continue to expect our full-year gross margin to be in the range of 72% to 72.5%, which now assumes a negative FX impact of 100 basis points for the year, a slight increase from the full year 2017 outlook we gave in April. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $801 million, or 35.5% of sales in Q2 2017, down 40 basis points year over year and at the midpoint of our guidance range of 35% to 36%. We're delivering on our SG&A improvement initiatives outlined in detail at our recent Investor Day, such as the optimization and expansion of our global shared services, and global indirect sourcing leverage. We continue to target full-year 2017 adjusted SG&A in a range of 35% to 36% of sales, which at the midpoint would represent a decrease of 60 basis points versus the full year 2016. Adjusted research and development expenses were $239 million in the second quarter, or 10.6% of sales, which is roughly flat year over year. We continue to expect full-year adjusted R&D to be in a range of 10% to 11%, and continue to target a rate of less than 10% by 2020, driven by geographic mix, greater efficiencies and leverage. Royalty expense was 0.8% of sales in Q2, which is similar to prior year, and we expect our royalty rate to remain approximately 1% of sales for 2017. As a result, Q2 2017 adjusted operating margin of 26% increased 260 basis points year over year, and was at the midpoint of our guidance range of 25.5% to 26.5%. The improvement over prior year was largely driven by strong operational improvements in our Rhythm Management segment operating margin results. The Rhythm Management team delivered an adjusted operating margin of 20.9% for Q2, as the team continues to make strong progress on gross margin, focus on expense control, and leverage the improved top-line performance of the global business. As you would expect, in any given quarter you may see some variation in adjusted segment operating margin, but we now expect the full year 2017 Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to be approximately 19% to 20%, which is an increase over our prior expectations of 18% to 19%. The Cardiovascular and MedSurg segments also realized year-over-year improvements in adjusted operating margin of 40 basis points and a 110 basis points respectively, all while continuing to invest in commercial capabilities for key upcoming launches. Now, I'll move on to interest and other expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $58 million, roughly flat to Q2 of last year. Our average interest expense rate was 3.9% in Q2 this year compared to 4% in Q2 last year. Adjusted other expense was $14 million in the second quarter, and includes $6 million in equity method dilution from our portfolio of venture investments. We believe this is representative of a go-forward run rate and annualizes to approximately $25 million per year. We still expect the full-year below-the-line expense, which is comprised of interest expense, dilution from our venture investment portfolio, and costs associated with our FX hedging program, to be approximately $300 million in both 2017 and 2018. Of note, this excludes an impairment of certain of our investments of $53 million recorded in the quarter. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, we've grown our portfolio of venture investments to over 30 companies, and as you'd expect, we may see impairments from time to time, but we continue to be very excited about the portfolio. Our tax rate for the second quarter was negative 60.3% on a reported basis, and 13.9% on an adjusted basis, at the high end of our guidance range of 13% to 14%. We continue to expect full-year adjusted tax rate to be in a range of 12.5% to 13%. Finally, Q2 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $0.32 includes approximately $0.02 of unfavorable foreign exchange, as we expected, and represents 18% year-over-year growth, or 24% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, which includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $298 million, after tax, Q2 2017 EPS was $0.11. This is below our guidance range of $0.18 to $0.21, primarily due to litigation-related charges of $205 million associated with our mesh litigation. Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $1.779 billion as of June 30, 2017. During the quarter, as we continued working through settlement discussions and the related claims processing related to our mesh litigation, more of the potential settlement claims were verified than previously expected. As a reminder, to determine our reserve, we continually assess the volume of known claims, the estimated cost to resolve each claim, an estimate of future claims, and the cost to defend each claim, in order to calculate the required reserve and make any necessary adjustments. We have entered into or in the final stages of entering into master settlement agreements, in principle, with certain plaintiffs' counsel to resolve and an aggregate of approximately 38,000 of our approximately 48,000 known claims, which represents nearly 80% of those claims. We remain committed to reducing the risk in our balance sheet and continue to target a resolution of the majority of our remaining mesh claims in 2018. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $409 million, compared to $464 million in Q2 last year. In the quarter, we used cash primarily to fund previously-agreed-upon legal settlements as well as the Symetis acquisition. As of June 30, 2017, we had cash on hand of $195 million. We continue to expect full-year adjusted free cash flow to be $1.750 billion, representing 9% growth in the year, and expect the primary use of the cash generated in 2017 and into 2018 will be to fund mesh legal settlements and the IRS stipulation of settled issues, once finalized. Capital expenditures for the second quarter 2017 totaled $68 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the full year to be approximately $300 million. We ended Q2 with 1.391 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, and we expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.394 billion for Q3 and 1.393 billion for the full year 2017. Now I'll now walk through the guidance for Q3 and the full year 2017. For the full year, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $8.890 billion to $8.990 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of approximately 7% on an operational basis, within a range of 6% to 8% growth. This guidance includes an approximate 120 basis point contribution from EndoChoice and Symetis, and represents 6% to 7% growth on a reported basis. We now expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $30 million for the full year 2017. As I mentioned earlier, we now expect full-year 2017 adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.23 to $1.27, representing 11% to 14% adjusted earnings per share growth, and continue to assume the full-year negative impact of FX will be approximately $0.08. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.70 to $0.74. Now turning to Q3 2017, we expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $2.180 billion to $2.210 billion. This represents year-over-year growth in a range of 5% to 6% operationally, including the approximate 140 basis point contribution from acquisitions. We expect the foreign exchange impact on Q3 revenue to be a $20 million headwind. For the third quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.29 to $0.31 per share, representing 9% to 16% adjusted earnings growth. GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter is expected to be in a range of $0.16 to $0.18 per share. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q2 2017 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q2 results, as well as Q3 and full-year 2017 guidance, including P&L line item guidance. So with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A. Susan Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Dan. Tanya, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Tanya, please go ahead. Operator : Thank you. And our first question we'll take will be from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. And good morning, everybody. First off, congratulations on a, what was a very strong quarter on a tough comp. I did want to make sure I understood, Dan, the guidance for the year and your thoughts on the third quarter. It looked like, with the guidance update, that you're widening the organic sales growth range for the year from what had been 5.3% to 6.3%, to 4.8% to 6.8%. So, one, do we have that right, that actually the range on we would call organic growth, backing out EndoChoice and Symetis and currency, widened? And then second, how do you view the third quarter comp, relative to the comp you had this quarter? Because obviously we all thought this was a pretty tough comp quarter for you guys, and you put up a very strong performance. Third quarter looks like another very tough comp for you guys. Just put it in some context, how you view the year-over-year comparison? Thanks. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure, Mike. I'll start, and Mike can add in any comments he wants as well. So, relative to the guidance, I wouldn't overthink the range relative to the full year. So if you look at the range we have, the way we look at it is, 7% is what we think is a likely outcome, and we increased the top end to 8%. So as you look at it, we could have thrown a half in there and gone 6.5% to 7.5%. We chose to say 7% is the likely outcome, and just ranged it 100 basis points on either side. So I wouldn't overthink the ends of that range. Specific to comps for Q3, it's a 9% organic comp. It was 10% in Q2, and it's a 9% comp in Q3. So feel like, again, off of what are pretty heady comps from last year, the revenue growth range of 5% to 6% for Q3 is still pretty strong. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then can you spend a little more time on the men's health business? Because when you made that acquisition, we didn't view it as being a growth accretive acquisition; it's turned out to be one. It had a very strong quarter again this quarter and exceeded our expectations. Can you just talk a little bit about what's going on there? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. Good morning, Mike. The Uro business is really performing at a very high level for many number of quarters in a row now, a 10% revenue growth again in second quarter. And it's really across the board. The stone business is doing extremely well, and the catalyst for the stone business is that LithoVue disposable scope. That's very disruptive, and we see a lot of tailwinds, given some of the comments in the script regarding FDA requirements to putting on reusable scopes, as well as the healthcare economics that hospitals are starting to see in terms of the cost savings of using LithoVue. And LithoVue is enabling us to pull through greater stone share. And then you move on to the other businesses, the men's health business is doing particularly well, really exceeding our expectations in the U.S. and globally, and that's a very strong gross margin product for us. The BPH business is doing okay. Another big catalyst for the Uro business is global expansion. Our emerging market growth is extremely, extremely strong, and we're investing in physician training in men's health, as well as adding commercials reps. So essentially having that full portfolio together is driving larger synergies on the bottom line, as well as incremental revenue synergies. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Understood. Okay, thank you, Mike. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. Next we go to the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Just \u2013 yeah, maybe a quick clarification and two quick product questions. Just in terms of the back half of your guidance, is a good way to think about it, basically you're kind of saying back half is sort of stable on a momentum basis, there's no underlying changes in most of the business lines, just the comp is harder, business is pretty stable; is that a good way to think about the second half? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: I think that's fair, and then we're adding in Symetis, right? So we didn't have Symetis in guidance as of last quarter, so we're adding that in. We've obviously updated the structural heart guidance, but I think that's a fair way to look at it, yes, David. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. And then... Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: And then to add to that is.. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Sorry. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: That is the right \u2013 a good summary. And particularly in Q3, we got very tough DES comp, so we have a 10% comp overall for the company, and our highest DES comp is in the third quarter \u2013 from 2016 \u2013 which is 14%. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Very helpful, Dan, and Mike. So two quick product questions. The first is just the EP business was the other business, other than urology, that looked like it got better on a momentum basis. Could you just talk about the trends in EP? And then just the early Symetis feedback, obviously taking the smaller business on your broader distribution channel, is some sense of how that's trending here? Even though I know it's early days? Thank you. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. So, we are committed to this EP business, and we continue to \u2013 I hate to use the word \"slowly,\" but we are improving the platform and the product portfolio globally each quarter. And this new launch of this Rhythmia HDx platform has gone extremely well in Europe, and we're starting to roll that out a bit more now in Japan and the U.S., so it's giving physicians more confidence in the differentiation of Rhythmia. And we'll be embarking on a nice cadence of therapeutic catheter launches, ideally in the second half in Europe with our IntellaNav MiFi OI launch, and that will be followed in 2018 with that same catheter, therapeutic catheter launch in the U.S. So you'll start to see more impactful therapeutic catheter launch cadence coming. Dr. Stein is here as well, any comment you'd like to make on that? Kenneth Stein, M.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. The only thing I'd add, Dave, is that the IntellaNav's MiFi OI catheter, in combination with Rhythmia HDx, then becomes the foundational platform for our DirectSense technology, which we really do see as being revolutionary in enabling physicians to better assess tissue contact and type of tissue the catheter's in contact with, and that also becomes the foundation for our Force-Sensing technology as well. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: And \u2013 thanks, Ken, and \u2013 Dr. Stein. On the Symetis, we're really pleased, it's early days, we're just under two months. The integration's gone \u2013 going extremely well. The leadership team is in place and solidified there. We're focused on expanding supply, of the capability by ramping up manufacturing, and importantly, we're training all of our TAVR commercial team, clinical and commercial, on the ACURATE platform. And so the great news is, when our LOTUS platform gets back in the market by year end, we'll have a clinical team and a sales force that can sell both platforms. So we're pleased with that, we upped our structural heart guidance a bit to $275 million, to reflect the impact of Symetis. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks so much. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Next we go to the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen. Please go ahead. Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to just start off with a question back from the Investor Day just on the TAVR franchise and intermediate and low risk timelines. So the strategy behind waiting until 2019, I was just hoping you could just recap that and help us think about the start of those trials and the kind of strategy behind waiting till 2019? Ian Meredith, M.D., Ph.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Josh, this is Ian Meredith here. So, pleased to take your question. Obviously, the first and the highest priority is to have LOTUS Edge approved in the U.S. for extreme and high-risk patients, and we'll follow that with establishing a LOTUS Edge bicuspid valve registry. And then the immediate priority thereafter is high and extreme risk ACURATE approval in the U.S. and Japan. And of course our priorities hot on the tail of those immediate priorities would be intermediate and low-risk approval in U.S., Japan, for both ACURATE Symetis \u2013 the ACURATE neo/IS platform, and indeed LOTUS Edge. So with those priorities structured that way, the highest priority obviously is to establish extreme and high risk approval for both valves as expeditiously and timely as can be achieved, and then the low-risk of course will be to follow the intermediate risk, as one would expect, it's likely to those trials would have to randomized. Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks, Ian. And just on the follow up, the Endoscopy business, you made some comments, Mike, in your prepared remarks, but I was just hoping if there's anything else, your sequential growth for that business was phenomenal. It was one of the line items that we were little bit concerned about heading them into the quarter, but 6%, 7% sequential growth \u2013 were there any one-timers there, or is just still pure strength on SpyGlass adoption, utilization, and how sustainable is that type of sequential growth trend? Thanks a lot. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: That business performs for us each quarter, 12% operational, 7% organic, when you back out the acquisition that we made. And I think what's unique about this business is, there are core products continue to grow nicely, and they are expanding into new categories. The SpyGlass digital platform has really been a breakthrough for the company, and they continue to focus on additional enhancements to kind of extend the lead there. That pulls through some of the core portfolio. The EndoChoice acquisition has moved us into some new spaces where there's a lot of synergies, in the pathology market, and so \u2013 and then lastly it's a very global company, this business for us. Over half the sales are outside the U.S., and there's very strong growth there in emerging markets. So, we expect that Endo business to continue to put up strong above-market growth. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thank you, Josh. Operator : Thank you. Next we go to the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. Can we pause for a minute on your third quarter guidance? By our calculation, it looks like it's up 3.5% to 4.5%, 3.6% to 4.6% organic. Is that the right way to look at it, and if so, that's somewhat in the lower side than I would have expected. Am I looking at this right? Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Joanne, this is Dan. No, that the way I would look at it is, the guidance for Q3 is 5% to 6% operational growth. The contribution from the acquisitions of EndoChoice and Symetis is 140 basis points. So if you take that off, you get to an organic growth rate that \u2013 again, in the range of what you're saying. Some of the challenges there, in terms of the sequential growth from Q2 to Q3, you look at CRM; we anniversary some of the MRI-safe Brady technologies in the U.S. We love the growth we've had in urology, but at 18% and 10% and some very high comps there, with anniversarying some share gains from a competitor exit. And then Mike mentioned the DES comps that we have. So the organic piece is a little bit lower than Q2, but still at that 5% to 6% of that 9% comp from last year, and then another 10% comp in Q4, feel like that still stacks up pretty well compared to our peers. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. I'd just add, a bit of a cheerleader here, but I think 6% to 8% full-year guidance, midpoint of 7%, pretty nicely above the peer group, against 9% or 10% organic growth comp for the year. So I think if we can grow the company faster than the peer group, facing that type of comparison, that's pretty strong. And then we look forward to 2018, and then as we detailed at Investor Day, the comps will be slightly easier in 2018 than there were this year. And then we're, as I've mentioned before, really excited about this $13 billion of new markets that we'll entering into. When you look at that Investor Day presentation, 2018 through to 2020. So I think it's a pretty strong performance for the team, delivering above market against a 10% comp. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Sounds good to me. As a follow-up question, WATCHMAN is really doing quite well. You raised your structural heart guidance. How do we think about the momentum in that franchise, and can you remind us about the timing of next generation products, how they start coming into the market to help you out? Thank you. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. WATCHMAN is doing great. We \u2013 I think the most important thing is just the clinical success that that platform is seeing, the actual real implant success rates actually exceeding the safety rate seen in some of the clinical trials. So the performance, most importantly in the safety and efficacy, as detailed at HRS and EuroPCR clinical trials, at Dr. Stein can highlight a bit more if you're interested, are very good. So you're building physician confidence with the platform. We obviously took up our structural heart revenue guidance to $275 million, which is \u2013 a big part of that is WATCHMAN, obviously, given the LOTUS recall. And a big part of our efforts beyond the safety and great outcomes is on market development. So we are building quite a few different swim lanes of digital capabilities, therapeutic reps to drive increased awareness, leveraging the broader commercial teams of our CRM, EP and IC teams to drive awareness and to assist the WATCHMAN sales team. And then we're looking at expanding globally, we're enhancing our contribution of WATCHMAN in China, and we're excited about bringing WATCHMAN to the Japanese market in mid-2019. On the next generation WATCHMAN product, likely to have EU approval in mid 2018 for the WATCHMAN and FLEX platform. Now, Dr. Stein, any other comments on WATCHMAN, in general? Kenneth Stein, M.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.: Again, just to say, pleased as you say with the momentum, see it continuing as we can continue to train, bring new operators, new centers online. In terms of the clinical trial, cadence, as Mike said, expecting the enhanced FLEX to get CE mark in mid-2018 and to begin enrolling in our U.S. approval trial at that point, which would put us on track to get estimated U.S. approval roughly the same time as our competitors get approval on their first generation devices. Likewise, just to reiterate, as Mike said, completed enrollment in Japan of SALUTE, which is the trial that will get us approval in Japan. And although we're in the early stages, pleased at this point with the cadence of our ASAP-TOO trial, which is an indication expansion trial that will get us a FDA labeling for the oral anti-coagulation contraindicated population. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Terrific. Thanks for a great quarter. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Joanne. Operator : Thanks. Next, we go to the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Two product-related questions, starting with drug-eluting stents. I think I heard you say, Mike, there was about 1% growth on a global basis in Q2. And SYNERGY's been a great product for you guys, but that lapping. So I'm curious your thoughts, and Dr. Meredith's thoughts, on kind of what's next, how we should think about growth going forward? And we didn't hear a lot about your internal bioabsorbable program at the Analyst Day. But Dr. Meredith, I'm curious to hear how you're thinking about the future of this franchise from a technology standpoint? And I have one follow-up. Thanks. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. I'll make a few comments, then Dr. Meredith can add. Our DES business really pays a lot of the bills for our investments in structural heart. So, the fact that we can continue to grow that business despite a double-digit comp is nice accomplishment by the global team there. So we do anticipate that SYNERGY will continue to be the market-leading stent, that it will grow slightly above market, and it will drive the contribution that we need it to so we can fuel all our WATCHMAN, TAVR, and eventual mitral programs. So that's a really important part of our portfolio. And we don't see a, really a \u2013 over our LRP program, we don't see a new stent offering from a competitor that will threaten the safety and clinical efficacy of SYNERGY. So I think we're in a good position strategically. In terms of next generation, the bulk of our investment, as Kevin talked about at the Investor Day meeting, is in complex coronary as well as structural heart. So, that's the primary investment area with our cardiology business. And maybe Dr. Meredith can make some comments on fully resorbable space, if you like? Ian Meredith, M.D., Ph.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Mike. I think we're all aware of the burden of data that is now being published to show the less-than-stellar performance of the first generation bioabsorbable stents, and these scaffolds have all been associated with a higher risk of stent thrombosis at one year that led to a warning note in Europe, of course. This has meant that there's some skepticism towards this technology currently, and it certainly means that we don't need to focus primarily on this at this point in time. Obviously the RENUVIA platform has been a strut and is more of fracture resistant, but given the sort of global move away from BRS technologies at the moment, it's doesn't make sense to have that as a primary focus. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's very helpful. And then, back to WATCHMAN, one of the comments you made at the Investor Day that I thought was interesting was that you expect over 30,000 implants over the next 14 to 18 months, which is roughly the number of implants since launch. And by our met, that implies about $420 million in revenue, assuming about a $14,000 ASP. Is that the right way to think about it? And do you feel that you can get them closer to 14 months at this point, or you're still keeping that range of 14 to 18 months? Thanks for taking the questions. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. I think on the heels of what we had said at Investor Day, we'd stick with that, and I think the commentary from Dr. Stein and Mike is appropriate, that we're really excited about WATCHMAN and the technology and what it has done, and what it can do in the future, but we'd stick with that timing over that timeframe. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: All right. Operator : And next we'll go to the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead. Frederick Allen Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Some more TAVR first, can you give us any more color on where you are with the LOTUS fix? Last we heard, I think at PCR your input \u2013 you were implementing manufacturing changes, and is that all done? And maybe some color on the regulatory process as well? Among Symetis, it's an easy valve to learn, you're training everybody; maybe you could talk to us about when the training's going to be done, and your thoughts about with this easy to learn valve, could we see a fairly rapid Symetis uptake in new European centers? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. So, on Symetis, really, it will never be done, because we're going to train our reps around the world as the cadence of Symetis moves from Europe to U.S., Japan, and over Asia. So it's really part of our ongoing platform now. The good news is that all the training programs are in place, and we're building up additional staff and training capabilities to fully train the existing BSE team, and the BSE team in the U.S. that's being established to launch LOTUS. So that infrastructure is moving along quite well. Xavier and the team in the Europe are doing nice job in building that out. And we are seeing, I would say slightly above our deal model, early days, in terms of Symetis uptake. And some of the comments that were made at the Investor Day, it's a high-performing valve that's very, very easy to use, and has very impressive kind of clinical studies that are in play, that will be reported out in the SCOPE trials. So Symetis is going well, we're very excited about that, and we're pleased that we doubled down in that market, given the size and the differentiation between LOTUS and Symetis. On LOTUS itself, it's really nothing new to report since the Investor Day meeting. We anticipate EU launch by year end and U.S. PMA approval in the fourth quarter, so we can launch that product ideally end of second quarter in the U.S. And the R&D teams and ops teams, supply chain teams doing a really nice job. And we want to lock that down, so we can mass produce LOTUS to serve the markets. And essentially, we feel like the fix was identified months ago, and the root cause, and all the additional validation. And also the engagement with the regulatory bodies in Europe is a bit fluid, and that's where we're working through, but we feel like the timelines that we've laid out give us the proper amount of flexibility to manage any minimal clinical requirements or any regulatory discussions. Frederick Allen Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Mike. And just on the S-ICD adoption. You highlighted the strong worldwide EMBLEM growth, which is encouraging. Just where are we in the penetration goals that you dreamt of, and do we need the MRI \u2013 I'm sorry, the leafless pace (50:29) approval to really further accelerate the growth, or is there a lot more to go even before you get there? Thanks so much. Kenneth Stein, M.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. Hey, Rick. I'll take that. It's Ken. We're in even probably a little better than where we thought we would be when we did the deal to acquire camera on the S-ICD. In terms of where do we go with penetration, right, the key is at this point, how deeply can we get penetrated into the traditional primary prevention indicated market? And that's why I thought the data that we presented at HRS earlier this year, and we highlighted at the Investor's Day from our post approval study in the U.S., we now see that two-thirds of the implants of the device in the U.S. are in that traditional primary prevention population. And I think, even ahead of getting our modular CRM device that is the leadless pacemaker that communicates with the S-ICD, even ahead of getting that, we see that we can continue to grow that penetration into primary prevention. And then I think the two opportunities to further accelerate that are, first of all, getting modular CRM into clinical trials and eventually into the market, so that there is an opportunity to provide anti-tachycardia pacing while staying leadless for those patients who need it. And then also our mated S-ICD trial, which is an indication expansion trial that would potentially bring in a completely new population of primary prevention patients, and that's those patients with mid-range ejection fractions, primarily myocardial infarction and diabetes. And again, that's a population, that's roughly equivalent in size to the current primary prevention market to begin with, and a population that we feel is uniquely served by the S-ICD. Frederick Allen Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Ken. Operator : And next we will go to the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Oh! One moment. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: We lost Bob. Operator : I apologize. Just one moment, please. Next we'll go to the line of Matt Taylor from Barclays. Please go ahead. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Can you hear me, okay? Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Hi, Matt. We can hear you fine, Matt. Yeah, go ahead. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. So, I wanted to ask a question just on balancing cash flow. You're getting some more visibility on working through some of the settlements, and presumably that'll give you some more confidence and flexibility. Can you talk about, a, when that can happen, and how you might think about doing things differently when you have some more confidence in kind of that cash flow outlook? Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Matt. Yeah, and I think we hit this pretty well at Investor Day as well, that as we start to work through this year \u2013 this year is a big year for retiring the historical liabilities, in terms of mesh in the IRS settlement. So, put a lot of that behind us in 2017, still have to tail that into 2018, but once you get into certainly the second half of 2018 and absolutely into 2019 and 2020, you would see a significant increase in the amount of our free cash flow that will be able to put to more strategic uses like returning cash to shareholders and M&A. So I don't think there is any change relative to the philosophy of how we would view that over that timeframe, but we're looking forward to it relative to being able to put more of that cash to use. But the underlying philosophy and the financial discipline and the category leadership strategy that we've had, I think, is alive and well and would serve us as well as we move through that timeframe. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. And just to follow up on kind of a prior question, I appreciate Dr. Stein's comments on opportunities for S-ICD. I was wondering if you could comment on any thoughts you have now, with a little bit of time since the announcement of the re-opening of the NCD for ICDs and/or the comment period on MRI, if you think either of those things could have an impact on the market? Kenneth Stein, M.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. Sure, Matt. We fully supported CMS' decision to reopen the NCD for ICDs and let me deal with that before the MRI. And what we gave in terms of our feedback to CMS was the recommendation they preserve coverage for the currently covered populations, and to revise the NCD so it doesn't limit device choice. And most important, I think, to liberalize some of the current restrictions so that it can be consistent with the current guidelines and appropriate use criteria as developed by the societies, ACC, HRS, et cetera. I think with MRI, again, the question in terms of what's going to happen with their NCD really is going to be whether they're going to remove some of restrictions on performing MRI for patients with legacy devices based on the results of trials like the MagnaSafe Registry. Whether or not they do that, I don't see as having really any substantial impact on the market for devices that are being implanted currently. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much for the comments, guys. Operator : Thank you. Next we go to the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good, thanks. Can you hear me okay? Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: We can hear you fine, Bob. Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Sorry about that last one. So, Mike, just to start out, I've heard lots of questions here on (56:41) you provided. So maybe just to be clear, is there any change to any of the timelines that you mentioned at the Analyst Day, or any change whatsoever to your confidence in the revenue growth outlook that you discussed at the Analyst Day? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: No. I did screw up earlier in the call, I mentioned that LOTUS was going to be approved in the U.S. in fourth quarter this year, that a miss. I meant to say the PMA filing for U.S. will happen in fourth quarter 2017. So I did a nice job in messing that answer up, but other than that one, our outlook financially is unchanged from our Investor Day. Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: I even took our sales guidance up for the year, our sales guidance is up for the year, up around by a point. Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And just on that, so that U.S. timelines are the same as you talked about at the Analyst Day? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. Timelines for all TAVR, essentially timelines for everything, haven't changed over the last 45 days. Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Perfect. Just wanted to clarify. And then Dan, just one quick one for you on currency. I was wondering if you could just talk about the impact of currency on this year and next. Maybe just help us understand, from where rates are right now, what the impact of hedging is versus just the impact of FX translation? Just sort of get a little bit of \u2013 of a better sense of the moving pieces and what's in your guidance? Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. Let me start with revenue on that, Bob. So as we've gone through the year, the amount of headwind from FX on the top line has dissipated, right? We started off thinking about 125, it was gone to 85, now for our most recent guidance it's 30. And actually in Q4, it could flip to a tailwind for us, right? So \u2013 and that's obviously the market basket of rates that have changed over that timeframe. Primarily, the euro strengthening against the dollar, the pound a little bit the same, and then most other currencies seeing dollar strength, and the yen being somewhat flat during that timeframe. So pretty clear on that. We haven't given revenue impact guidance for 2018, we'll obviously do that as the time draws nearer to giving that guidance. In terms of gross margin, it's actually been a little bit of a different story. It was kind of 50 basis points full-year in the February guidance, went to 90, and now is at 100. So roughly unchanged from the April guidance, and that's just simply a reflection of the hedging contracts we have, when they were entered into, and then the expiration of those. So \u2013 and which currencies are moving. So, you don't \u2013 the reason that the top line has gotten better through the year, but we still have seen \u2013 will still see $0.08 at the bottom line is, we're largely hedged for the year. I mean, the majority of that top line benefit has been from the Euro, and we're largely hedged against the Euro for 2017, so we don't get a lot of the drop through, which is the benefit of a hedging program, you don't want the significant swings. So that's kind of the relationship in 2017 of top line and bottom line, and we were pretty clear I think at Investors Day that we see about a nickel, $0.05, of negative FX with rates where they are today in 2018. Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you very much. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Bob. Operator : Thank you. Next we go to the line of Matt Miksic with UBS. Please go ahead. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking our questions. Just a couple of follow-ups on some of the topics that you've covered. One on the CRM share recapture, the growth in that business. Any color you could provide just on the drivers of that? Obviously MRI saved and pacers and some of the new leads you've launched, say a year or so ago, and high power. But any other competitive drivers you see or advantages you're enjoying would be helpful, and I have one follow up on WATCHMAN. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. So overall, really pleased, not only \u2013 particularly pleased with the margin improvement that Joe Fitzgerald's team delivered, impressive in a market that's challenging in terms of its overall growth profile. What's important for us in CRM is, we're continuing to grow above market. Our Brady results were nicely above market despite anniversarying our launch and a competitor's recent launch. So we expect some challenges there with some of the comps, but we continue to growth above market, which is kind of the trend for the company. And then in defib, which is really important, I think an encouraging trend there, despite kind of flat overall growth, was the growth outside the U.S., where we've launched the RESONATE platform. So, in Europe in particular, we're seeing some lightness in volume, but the team has done a nice job of growing that business off the RESONATE launch. And that will be the launch that will happen in the U.S. more fully once we have MRI approved by year-end. So in 2018, we look forward to having global defib RESONATE platform with the multipoint pacing, as well as MRI capability and HeartLogic, as well as the longevity benefit. So we think we have lot of differentiation with that. And then as Dr. Stein commented, our SIC platform really differentiates Boston Scientific. It comes at nice gross margins, and we continue to see improved utilization of that platform. So, I think the product positioning is quite strong, and we hope to see some of the benefits of the replacement cycle. That being said, of all of our markets this is likely the most challenged in terms of its overall growth rate, kind of in a low single-digit growth rate range. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Sure. That's very helpful color. And then on maybe one of your more rapidly expanding markets, on WATCHMAN. If you could talk a little bit about the way you're seeing sort of new centers coming up to speed in the U.S., the pace of that growth? Maybe also that degree to which other product lines are getting pulled into these conversations with your customers, either AFib or CRM or otherwise, that kind of color would be very helpful? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah, probably \u2013 thank you, Matt. WATCHMAN, as you said, we're very pleased with its uptake, but definitely not satisfied because we want \u2013 we expect a lot more. Every point of utilization as we highlighted at Investor Day, is another $250 million market opportunity. So our focus, besides getting strong clinical results and training, is increasing utilization. And that's where most of our efforts are on; we have a large implanter base of approximately 350, 375. We're focused on training more doctors, more physicians at those sites, and really trying to find any friction points in those sites to improve utilization. And that's what the teams are working through, and you see a wide, quite frankly a wide range of utilization across sites and centers. And our focus is on improving that scale across the board. And we have a nice head start competitively, as you know. I won't comment too much more on pull-through. Obviously when you have a nice platform like that, as well as a leading drug-eluting stent, I've commented on the RESONATE platform for CRM. Our overall portfolio in PI \u2013 which actually hasn't been discussed today \u2013 our overall portfolio in PI, Interventional Cardiology and Rhythm, is quite strong. And then, with our structural heart emphasis, there is some \u2013 occasionally some bundling that goes across, but I would say a lot less bundling than what's discussed with analysts, quite frankly. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, Mike. Susan Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: With that, we'd like to conclude the call.

Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Susie Lisa. Please go ahead. Susan Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thank you, Stacy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q3 2017 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Investors/Filings/Quarterly Results and non-GAAP reconciliations. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights for Q3 2017; Dan will review the financials for the quarter, and then Q4 2017 and full year 2017 guidance; and then, we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith, and Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that, on the call, operational revenue growth is defined as excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Organic revenue growth is defined as excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from the acquisitions of EndoChoice and Symetis over the relevant prior year period. In Mike and Dan's remarks, all references to growth are on an organic year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified. Also of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q4 and full year 2017 guidance, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Well done, Susie. Good morning, everyone. Boston Scientific delivered strong results, again, in third quarter 2017 with both revenue and EPS coming in at the high end of our guidance range despite a 9% organic revenue growth comparison in Q3 2016. Operational revenue growth of 6% and organic revenue growth of 4% reflects strong execution by our global teams and the success of our category lead strategy. We leveraged the 6% operational revenue growth in the quarter to deliver a 16% adjusted EPS growth, or $0.31 per share, which is the high end of our guidance range. Also, if you exclude the $0.02 negative impact of foreign exchange, adjusted EPS grew 23% year-over-year. This EPS growth reflects an 80 basis point year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating margin to 25.1%, led by a solid 72.2% gross margin and the 100 basis point reduction to year-over-year in SG&A spending to 35.2% of revenue. We're also excited about our plans to close out 2017, build upon our global momentum and drive sustainable long-term growth in 2018 and beyond. We're also narrowing our full-year 2017 operational revenue growth guidance to an estimated 7% growth, which includes an approximate 120 basis point full-year impact from the EndoChoice and Symetis acquisitions. We're also narrowing our full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $1.24 to $1.27, which represents 11% to 14% earnings growth. This revised adjusted EPS guidance includes an expected $0.07 to $0.08 negative impact, or approximate 700 basis point headwind, from foreign exchange. I'll now provide some highlights on third quarter 2017 results and thoughts to finish out the year. We continue to grow faster than market in most all of our businesses and regions. We also delivered consistent organic revenue growth in every geography, led by 8% growth in AMEA, 5% in Europe, and 3% in the U.S. We also continued to outperform in the Emerging Markets with 18% growth in the quarter, including 23% in China. I'll start with MedSurg highlights. The three MedSurg businesses together delivered 8% organic revenue growth and 10% operational growth, including the EndoChoice acquisition, which continues to deliver above our deal plan. In Endo, organic revenue grew 5% in Q3 and 10% including the EndoChoice, led by strong performance from the Spy DS [SpyGlass DS] Visualization System, AXIOS platform, Res 360 Hemostasis Clip and EndoChoice ambulatory surgery center portfolio. We do expect Endo to return back to mid to high single-digit growth rates in the fourth quarter. We have now completed the integration of EndoChoice and revenue is ahead of plan, contributing 75 basis points to total growth in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with the results from our expanding presence in the ambulatory surgery center market, led by differentiated offerings in GI pathology and infection prevention. Our Urology and Pelvic Health businesses continued this streak of double-digit organic revenue growth, led by our Single-Use Digital LithoVue Ureteroscope and products to treat men's health and pelvic floor conditions. The overall 10% growth across Uro/PH is particularly notable in light of a 13% growth comparison in Q3 2016. Emerging market sales continue to accelerate, led by our stone and men's health franchises. In our men's health business, we look forward to future developmental launch of new products now that the FDA Warning Letter was lifted during the third quarter from our Minnetonka, Minnesota facility. In Neuromodulation, revenue grew 11% in Q3, driven by strength in spinal cord stimulation market, sales of our Montage MRI platform, as well as continued strong uptake of the Vercise MRI Deep Brain Stimulation System in Europe. The strength in the SCS market reinforces the need for flexible technology platforms, like Spectra, that can enable physicians to address the unique needs of patients suffering from pain. We are deep into preparations for our expected launch of Vercise into the U.S. deep brain stimulation market, which we expect by year-end 2017 or early 2018, followed by a Directional Lead and MRI conditional labeling expected in 2018. Now, I'll turn to Cardiovascular. This group grew 3% against a very difficult 12% growth comparison in Q3 2016. Peripheral Interventions was up 5% on strong growth in Asia and Latin America. We continue to see solid growth from across the portfolio, including drug-eluting technologies Eluvia Stent and Ranger Balloon in Europe, Jetstream Atherectomy and OptiCross intravascular ultrasound, now in the second quarter of launch for our Peripheral applications. In September, at the CIRSE European conference, we presented compelling data from both drug-eluting platforms, Eluvia DES and Ranger DCB, both with mid-80% ranges rates of freedom from TLR. While 2018 will be a quieter year for new product launches in PI, the globalization momentum continues and the pipeline is very strong for 2019 and 2020. Our Interventional Cardiology business grew operational revenue 4% and organic revenue 2%, in light of a 13% growth comp in Q3 2016. Our performance was led by strong sales of our WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device, our portfolio of complex PCI products and above-plan contribution from the Symetis ACURATE platform in Europe. The WATCHMAN platform had another excellent quarter and continues to build global momentum as our market development efforts continue. The U.S. continues to be our largest and most important market, and we're pleased to announce that, effective October 1, Medicare reimbursement rates for DRG 274, to which 93% of WATCHMAN implants map to, increased by an average of 10.6%. We also continue to drive multiple market development efforts for WATCHMAN to increase physician and patient awareness. We now expect to end 2017 with over 375 accounts implanting WATCHMAN, while continuing to see increased reorder rates in previously opened accounts. We're also making good progress on building the WATCHMAN franchise outside the U.S. China is off to a solid start and we hit a new monthly record for implants in September. At last month's Asia-Pac HRS, WATCHMAN was showcased by principle investigators from the Japan SALUTE Approval Trial, where we remain on track to launch in 2019. Also, at Asia-Pac HRS, investigators presented the WATCHMAN Asia-Pac Registry, which showed a 99% implant success rate and an 82% low risk ischemic stroke rate compared to expected outcomes at one year, while also avoiding the bleeding risk associated with long-term anticoagulation. We continue to make strong progress, both clinically and commercially, with WATCHMAN and view it as a significant long-term growth driver. Products for complex PCI procedures grew double-digits, led by strong Atherectomy and Cutting Balloon sales. Our PCI Guidance business grew single-digits and continues to build momentum with strong IVUS sales in the launch, our integrative fractional flow reserve platform. Global DES sales declined low single-digits in the quarter, reflecting a very challenging 14% growth comp in Q3 2016. Within DES, we will continue to invest in our market leading SYNERGY platform with multiple new portfolio enhancements in progress. Turning to TAVR, we continue to see very strong clinical and commercial performance with the ACURATE neo Valve across Europe, as integration activities remain on target. ACURATE demonstrated strong year-over-year growth, ahead of our expectations, and continues to take market share. Positive clinical data also continues to emerge with ACURATE, as seen just this week in a publication in JACC : Interventions (sic) [JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions], comparing ACURATE to SAPIEN S3, which we will discuss in greater detail during our TCT Investor webcast Monday, along with more insights into our clinical program. We also continue to make progress bringing LOTUS back into the market. Our mid-2018 timeline for the U.S. of LOTUS Edge remains unchanged. We are nearing completion of our PMA submission with two of the three required modules already submitted to FDA in the third quarter. This includes a clinical module which was filed in August, and we continue to target submission of the final technical module and completion of the PMA submission by year-end or potentially January. In Europe we're also working closely with a notified body to provide pertinent information in review of our Notice of Change submission, which is standard submission path for an update to a CE Mark design dossier. Depending on the review time needed by European regulators, we now expect to launch LOTUS Edge in Europe in first quarter 2018, which would represent a delay from our original expectation for year-end in 2017. We expect this minor delay to LOTUS timelines will have minimal impact and will help ensure the utmost long-term success of LOTUS and our Component and Structural Heart franchise, which we believe will be uniquely positioned to address the needs of physician and patients with a differentiated TAVR portfolio. Importantly, we now expect to exceed our $275 million Structural Heart revenue guidance for 2017 and we look forward to providing you with additional details around our multiple TAVR and WATCHMAN clinical programs at our TCT webcast on Monday from Denver. Our Rhythm Management business grew faster than market at 1% in the third quarter. Our focus on Rhythm Management profitability has also paid off, resulting in another quarter with strong operating margins of 19.4%, which is up 230 basis points year-over-year. As for product trends, high voltage sales grew low-single digits and double-digit growth with our EMBLEM S-ICD, strong early launch feedback on our new Resonate platform in Europe and, now with MRI compatibility approval in the U.S. We're also very excited by the ongoing launch of the recently approved Resonate ICD CRT-D platform into the U.S. market. We believe Resonate brings entirely new and compelling capabilities to the CRM space with the introduction of the HeartLogic Heart Failure Diagnostic. HeartLogic can proactively predict worsening heart failure more than four weeks in advance with the highest level of predictability in the market, 70% sensitivity in the MultiSENSE trial and less than two unexplained alerts per patient year. Furthermore, the Resonate device has enabled backward compatible MRI labeling, they're equipped with MultiSite Pacing and offer the benefits of our best-in-industry longevity technology. Brady patient sales declined modestly as we fully anniversaried the launch of our U.S. ACCOLADE MRI Brady pulse generator, INGEVITY patient lead. Turning to EP, we grew sales 18% in the quarter led by improved uptake of our RHYTHMIA HDx platform globally. We launched the INTELLANAV MIFI OPEN-IRRIGATED therapeutic catheters in the EU and U.S., and we expect to begin early European commercialization of our DirectSense technology shortly, followed by the U.S. launch in the first half of 2018. We're also excited by the recently announced acquisition of Apama Medical, which allows us to expand into the single-shot pulmonary vein isolation ablation market, which is a potential $1 billion market by 2022. This multi-electrode single shot RF balloon catheter is designed to provide greater ease of use, improve visualization and more complete pulmonary vein isolation. The Apama design combines the primary benefits of differentiated energy levels via RF and shorter procedure times via balloon-based ablation approaches. Apama nicely complements our rhythm portfolio and will be integrated into our RHYTHMIA HDx Mapping and Nav platform. Our goal is to gain CE Mark for the Apama single-shot balloon by year-end 2018 and begin U.S. clinical trial enrollment in early 2019. So, to close this out, Boston Scientific's portfolio strategy, our effective globalization efforts and a execution focus are working and they continue to deliver strong and differentiated results. Also, as outlined in detail at our Investor Day back in June, we believe that we are well positioned to continue our performance track record into 2018, importantly, while accelerating our performance in 2019 and 2020. I want to thank our employees for their winning spirit and commitment to advancing science for life. Dan will now provide a detailed review of our financials. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Mike. Third quarter consolidated reported revenue of $2.222 billion represents 6% growth on a reported and operational basis, which excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency and is at the high end of our guidance range of 5% to 6%. Our reported revenue reflects a $3 million headwind from foreign exchange, which is $17 million or approximately 80 basis points less than the $20 million headwind expected at the time of guidance. Further, excluding the 140 basis point contribution from acquisitions, organic revenue was at the higher end of guidance with 4.3% growth. Although immaterial to the quarter overall, our revenue growth reflects a modest impact in the 10 basis point to 20 basis point range from the hurricanes in the quarter, which impacted procedures. Our thoughts are with those impacted by the hurricane and I'd like to reiterate Mike's thanks to our employees for their winning spirit, particularly on their ability to serve the needs of customers and patients throughout the many weather-related challenges this quarter. We delivered Q3 adjusted earnings per share of $0.31, also at the high end of our guidance range of $0.29 to $0.31, and representing 16% year-over-year growth. This double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth was driven primarily by the strong sales growth and P&L line item metrics that were in line with our guidance ranges. Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 72.2% compared to 72.5% in Q3 last year and, significantly, includes a year-over-year negative 120 basis point impact from foreign exchange, which is 40 basis points more than our guidance of 80 basis points. Revenue benefited from the euro strengthening, but since we are largely hedged for 2017, there is little corresponding benefit in gross profit, which negatively impacts the gross margin rate. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter represents a 30 basis point decrease over prior year, as manufacturing cost reductions and favorable product mix from continued strength in our WATCHMAN and men's health franchises were slightly offset by the gross margin phenomena I just mentioned, as well as onetime unfavorable variances in our Puerto Rico facility due to Hurricane Maria. Due to the great efforts by our team, our Puerto Rico plant is currently running at 90% capacity. While we do not expect any material ongoing impacts as a result of the storm, it remains a challenging situation and, after our number one priority of our employees and their well-being, our key business priorities are continuing to work to eliminate our current dependency upon generators for power, and validating the resiliency assurances we have from our raw materials and component suppliers. We expect our full year 2017 adjusted gross margin to be approximately 72% of sales, which now assumes a negative FX impact of 120 basis points for the year, a 20 basis point increase from the full year 2017 outlook we gave in July. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $783 million or 35.2% of sales in Q3, down 100 basis points year-over-year and at the low end of our guidance range of 35% to 36%. In any given quarter, you may see some variability and seasonality within SG&A, but we remain committed to SG&A optimization through initiatives like expansion of global shared services, end-to-end business process streamlining and automation, and global indirect sourcing leverage. We continue to expect our full year 2017 adjusted SG&A rate to be in a range of 35% to 36% of sales, which at the midpoint would represent a decrease of 60 basis points versus the full year last year. Adjusted research and development expenses were $247 million in the third quarter or 11.1% of sales, which is roughly flat year-over-year, and we continue to expect full year adjusted R&D to be in a range of 10% to 11%. Royalty expense was 0.7% of sales in Q3, which is 20 basis points lower than prior-year, due to a mix of certain product sales and their related royalty rates. But we expect our royalty rate to remain relatively consistent, just below 1% of sales for the full year 2017. As a result, Q3 2017 adjusted operating margin of 25.1% increased 80 basis points year-over-year and it was within our guidance range of 25% to 26%. The improvement over prior year was largely driven by strong operational improvements in our Rhythm Management and MedSurg segment results. The Rhythm Management team delivered an operating margin of 19.4% for Q3, an improvement of approximately 230 basis points over the prior year, as they continue to make great progress on gross margin and focus on expense control. We continue to expect the full year 2017 Rhythm Management operating margin to be approximately 19% to 20%. The MedSurg segment also realized significant year-over-year improvements in operating margin of approximately 170 basis points, delivering operating margin of 32.9% of sales, while continuing to invest in commercial capabilities for key upcoming launches. In the Cardiovascular segment, operating margin of 28.3% represents a decrease of approximately 180 basis points over the prior year due to commercial and development spend, primarily related to building our Structural Heart franchise. In any given quarter you may see some variation in segment operating margin, but Cardiovascular continues to be accretive to total company operating margin. Now, I'll move on to interest and other expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $57 million, roughly flat to Q3 of last year, and our average interest expense rate was 3.7% in Q3 this year compared to 3.9% in Q3 of 2016. Adjusted other expense was $11 million in the quarter, which is consistent sequentially and includes $6 million in equity method dilution from our portfolio of venture investments. As a reminder, our below the line expense is comprised of the dilution from our venture investment portfolio and interest expense as well as costs associated with our FX hedging program. For both full year 2017 and full year 2018, we expect below the line expenses, in aggregate, to be approximately $300 million. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 8.5% on a reported basis and 11.9% on an adjusted basis, below our guidance range of 13% to 14%, primarily due to timing of certain interim items. We now expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be in a range of 12% to 12.5%, which decreases the range by 50 basis points as a result of discretes recognized during the year. Finally, Q3 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $0.31 includes approximately $0.02 of unfavorable foreign exchange, as we expected, and represents 16% year-over-year growth, or 23% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, which includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $149 million after tax, Q3 2017 earnings per share was $0.20, exceeding our guidance range of $0.16 to $0.18. During the quarter, we continued to make progress on settlement discussions and the claims processing related to our mesh litigation and, as of today, we've entered into or are in the final stages of entering master settlement agreements in principle with certain plaintiff's counsel to resolve approximately 44,000 claims, which represent over 90% of our approximately 48,500 known claims. We remain committed to reducing the risk on our balance sheet and continue to target a resolution of the majority of our remaining mesh claims in 2018. Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $1.69 billion as of September 30, 2017. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $464 million, compared to $440 million in Q3 last year. And in the quarter, we used cash primarily to fund previously agreed upon legal settlements. As of September 30, 2017, we had cash on hand of $210 million. We continue to expect full year adjusted free cash flow to be $1.75 billion, representing 9% growth in the year, and expect the primary use of the cash generated in 2017 and into 2018 will be to fund mesh legal settlements. We continue to make progress in finalizing the IRS stipulation of settled issues, but now expect the payments for the settlement of approximately $500 million to be made in the first half of 2018 as we continue to work through the calculations and documentation necessary to finalize the agreement. Capital expenditures for the third quarter totaled $60 million. Given recent strategic investments, we now expect capital expenditures for the full year to be approximately $320 million versus our previous guidance of $300 million, but believe we can absorb the increased spend within our cash flow guidance. We ended Q3 with 1.394 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding and we expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.395 million for Q4 2017 and 1.393 billion for the full year 2017. I'll now walk through guidance for Q4 and the full year 2017. For the full year, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $8.985 billion to $9.015 billion, or $9 billion at the midpoint, which represents year-over-year growth of approximately 7% operationally. Included in this guidance is an approximate 120 basis point contribution from the EndoChoice and Symetis acquisitions, which implies 6% organic revenue growth for the year. We now expect foreign exchange to be a tailwind of approximately $10 million for the full year 2017 and, as a result, we expect to achieve 7% to 8% revenue growth on a reported basis. We're tightening the full year 2017 adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.24 to $1.27, representing 11% to 14% adjusted earnings growth, and now assume the full year negative impact of foreign exchange will be approximately $0.07 to $0.08. On a GAAP basis, we now expect earnings per share to be in a range of $0.71 to $0.75. Now, turning to Q4 2017, we expect consolidated revenue to be in a rage of $2.345 billion to $2.375 billion. This represents year-over-year growth in a range of 5% to 6% operationally and 4% to 5% organically, and it's a slight acceleration sequentially given the Q4 total company comparable that is 120 basis points higher than our Q3 comp. In Q4, we expect an approximate 130 basis point contribution from acquisitions and expect the foreign exchange impact on revenue to be a $40 million tailwind. For the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.32 to $0.35 per share, representing 7% to 17% adjusted earnings growth and includes $0.01 to $0.02 of negative FX impact. GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter is expected to be in a range of $0.19 to $0.23 per share. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q3 2017 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q3 results as well as Q4 and full year 2017 guidance, including P&L line item guidance. So, with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A. Susan Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Dan. Stacy, let's open it up for questions for the next 30 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Stacy, please go ahead. Operator : And we'll go to Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. [Technical Difficulty] (28:46-30:47) Operator : Pardon me. We'll go to David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Can you hear me? Susan Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yes. (30:54) David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I am the lucky winner. Okay. So, let me kick it off here with a couple questions. Maybe I'll just keep asking, because I'm the only one who can talk. But just two questions, one for Dan and one for Mike. So, Dan, a couple things. You did bring up momentum improving in the fourth quarter. I just wonder if you could highlight what gets better. And you also shared with us at Analyst Day some specific commentary for 2018 : 5% to 7% top, 50 bps of margin, $300 million non-op. Just want to know if there's any changes to 2018 assumptions you provided at Analyst Day, and then a quick follow-up for Mike. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. I'll start with the second one. No update to that. We obviously have not issued guidance yet for 2018; would expect to do that in early 2018. So those numbers that we had given as goals at Investor Day are still good. Relative to Q4, we've guided to Q4 organic revenue growth of 4% to 5%, so the midpoint is 4.5%. So yes, there is, I would say, a slight acceleration if you take the midpoint of our range at that 4.5% versus the 4.3% we posted in Q3. But really, the key point to note is the comp, as we mentioned. The growth comp for Q3 was 9% and it's a little bit over 10% in Q4, so I think that gets at the acceleration portion for Q4. Broadly, the biggest driver from Q3 to Q4 is CRM. We don't expect to be down 1% in CRM in the fourth quarter, especially with the momentum of the RESONATE launch and our MRI safe defibrillator portfolio in the U.S. So, I'd say that's probably the biggest driver of the momentum from Q3 to Q4. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Very helpful. And then, Mike, just want to clarify some things on LOTUS. So, the slight delay into the first quarter, you talked about platform enhancements. So, how much of this is \u2013 is it new platform enhancements, additional required documentation or is it simply a longer than expected standard process for Europe? And just U.S. PMA timing, is approval mid-2018 still a decent estimate? Thanks so much. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yes, I'll start with the second one. Yes, we haven't changed our timelines for U.S. approval to be mid-2018. So, we stay on track for that. There's a potential that the actual submission may slip into January, but we're comfortable with our timeline for approval mid-2018 and launching and starting to see a nice impact in the U.S. second half of 2018. No. In Europe, it really comes down to very small minimal impact to our overall business in Structural Heart franchise. And so what we want to do is ensure as robust a possible manufacturing and quality control process, given the importance of the platform, and we're just continuing to take a long-term view of this. And depending on the review time needed by the European regulators, we expect to launch LOTUS Edge in Europe in first quarter 2018. So, the bulk of it really is ensuring sound manufacturing and quality control, and we estimate a first quarter 2018 launch. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And Mike, were there any changes to the device inter-quarter that necessitated this move? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: No, we haven't made any technical changes beyond the pin pull fix that we've discussed. It's more scalability of our operations and supply chain and quality capabilities. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, and we'll go to the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Perfect, can you hear me okay? Susan Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: We can. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Mike, just to follow up with that and flesh that out if you can, what are you referring to in scalability of the operations on LOTUS? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Simply, as we look at the \u2013 we talked about the end of the line QC testing that we've put in place that's automated, as well as testing along the lines of it in different increments, as well as ensuring we have the sufficient design builds for the number of devices needed for the PMA submission. So, it's design builds as well as enhancements to the quality control and scalability of the line. And so, with that, as said, we don't see a delay in our U.S. approval and we see potentially a 90-day delay in terms of our European launch. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And so, the people just want to know what's the risk of another delay here happening. Do you just want to characterize that? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: We feel comfortable with it. So, we haven't projected a delay to the U.S., which is the biggest market. We've exceeded our Structural Heart guidance, we estimate, for the year. The only impact, which we think is quite minor, is in Europe, which is potentially a 90-day delay. And so, we debated forever whether we should just say January or first quarter; we landed on the first quarter. So, we feel like a 90-day delay in Europe is an accurate date and we haven't delayed our U.S. launch. And in the meantime, we exceeded expectations with WATCHMAN as well as ACURATE. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Let me \u2013 Dan, just one question on 2018. I heard your answer to David that \u2013 the dollar has moved since the June analyst meeting. You haven't gotten any benefit of that on the bottom line in 2017. Does that help you at all relative to that $0.05 headwind you called out for 2018? Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yes. Mike, I think that's a good point. As the rates have moved in 2017 and we're largely hedged in 2017, obviously, as we head into that year, we haven't seen a benefit. And actually, from a gross margin rate perspective, we've actually seen it go the other way on us. I think it's fair to assume our hope is that if rates were to stay where they are that we might see a little improvement against that $0.05 that we gave you of negative FX at Investor Day. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. I'll let some others jump in. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go to Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks for taking the question. So just to \u2013 sorry to beat the dead horse here on LOTUS, but it's obviously such a key pipeline for you. So, I'm just curious to see what exactly changed from your kind of previous guidance, like what exactly is causing this? Is it something that you guys have decided to do or is it something that's been sort of mandated by regulators that you have to do? Ian Meredith, M.D., Ph.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.: Perhaps, I can take that actually, Bob. This is Ian Meredith here. So, as you know, we are well out of the starting gate with the regulatory approval processes, both Europe and indeed for the PMA. We have the PMA submission in the U.S. We have two of the three modules already submitted, including the clinical module, and the clinical module is one that might be the normal stumbling block. That's out there. And the technical data, as Mike said, will be submitted by year-end or possibly in January, and we're just trying to meet the number of design builds to provide that technical information. In Europe, we're working very closely with our notified body to ensure LOTUS Edge notification of change reflects the regulator's requirements in advance of the new medical device regulation framework that will come into place 2019 to 2020. So, I think the timeline is in our hands and I think the processes Mike outlined before really characterize the minor delay. Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. Thank you for that. And then, Mike, one bigger-picture question for you on a couple of issues that have been swirling around the last month or two. I'd love to get your view on the outlook for growth in your business in China, given some of the changes that have been going on in China, or proposed changes from a kind of a national pricing perspective. What's your outlook for China in light of those potential changes? And any update, also, on kind of the national coverage decision determination that'll be made in late November on ICDs? Thank you. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yes. So, we continue to see very strong growth in China. We're up 18% in the Emerging Markets and over 20% growth in China, again. And really, our business in China is really being diversified beyond just drug-eluting stents. So, some of the pricing, tendering and so forth you see in drug-eluting stents potentially could have an impact on our price, which we've already baked in to lots of our guidance that we gave at Investor Day. But also, that's offset by volume as we continue to increase our commercial distribution reach, and now we're playing in tenders and provinces that we never had in the past. So, we think our volume and distribution reach will offset any potential price declines in DES in China. And then, we continue to register new products in complex coronary. But more importantly, we just continue to diversify beyond DES in China. WATCHMAN's doing quite well for us at nice ASPs. Our whole MedSurg business was very underweight there a few years ago. Now, Endo/Uro/Neuromod are gaining traction, as well as our PI business. So, we really don't see in our projections a change of our kind of 15% growth commitment coming out of the Emerging Markets over the next couple of years. Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go to... Susan Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sorry, Stacy. One second. On the NCD, Ken? Kenneth Stein, M.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yes, Bob. It's Ken. Just quickly on the NCD, we're looking forward to the revised national coverage decision. As you know, the existing NCD is quite old at this point and really sort of just hasn't kept up with professional society guidelines and appropriate use criteria. We have urged CMS reserve coverage for the currently covered patient populations, but also just to clarify reimbursement around some of the edge cases that got caught up in the DOJ investigation a few years back. And we're optimistic that the results are going to enable physicians to use the devices where appropriate and where indicated under current professional guidelines. Operator : And we'll go to Rick Wise with Stifel, Nicolaus. Please go ahead. Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Rick. Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Mike, maybe start off with some (41:32), obviously, you called out your above plan commercial performance for ACURATE neo. Maybe update us, if you would, in a little more detail on the European progress in whatever way you like : number of countries you're in now, hospitals. Can you give us any sense of market share and maybe what's next in terms of product gains or clinical milestones? Just give us some updates there. Thank you. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yes. Candidly, Symetis has outperformed our expectations, and its potential impact, globally, we're much more bullish on as part of our TEVR strategy, quite frankly, than versus we first acquired it. So today we're primarily in Germany and some of the Nordic countries, and we're expanding. We're getting out of some distribution arrangements that were previously set. We're working through that this year and early part of next. And we're enhancing our direct sales force with the Symetis platform. So, we'll seek to provide potentially more specific guidance on Structural Heart at the next earnings call. We'll detail out what our plans are for 2018. But essentially, we've been able to deploy the bulk of our Structural Heart commercial organization and clinical over to Symetis while we're enhancing the LOTUS valve and bringing that back to Europe in first quarter 2018, and Europe and U.S. approval by second half \u2013 second quarter next year. So, the valve is doing very well. And I think to speak to that, there was just an interesting article written yesterday in JACC Magazine, JACC, that maybe Ian can highlight a bit. Ian Meredith, M.D., Ph.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Rick, we continue to be very excited about the progress of the ACURATE platform in Europe. And as you know, the SCOPE I trial, which is a randomized, multi-center, head-to-head trial comparing S3 versus ACURATE, is going extremely well in the countries that it's in. And indeed, it's on target to complete its enrollment by the middle of next year. The SCOPE II trial, which is a randomized, head-to-head trial against the Evolut R or PRO platform is also doing well, and we expect that to complete enrollment in the middle of the year. As well as that, Mike just mentioned there was a nice publication in JACC : Interventions (sic) [JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions], yesterday. Three German centers comparing head-to-head \u2013 non-randomized data, though \u2013 ACURATE versus S3, showing equivalent efficacy and safety with a significantly lower rate of pacemakers for ACURATE and overall excellent results. Of course, this is not randomized data, but it bodes very well to the results of the forthcoming SCOPE I trial and, more importantly, the planned U.S. IDE ACURATE trial in full \u2013 for all classes, the extreme high and intermediate risk, which is planned for the second half of next year. So, these data published yesterday certainly give us great insight into the likely \u2013 or potentially likely outcomes for both SCOPE I and the U.S. IDE trial. Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Now, that's real helpful. Just one follow-up on pacers. The 4% decline sort of stands out this quarter. Maybe I missed it, but remind us the issues here. Is it competitive dynamics, product approval timing, and just where are we there in terms of getting that back on track? Thank you. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yes. So, Pacer for the quarter, we really anniversary \u2013 quite frankly, it's more of a comp issue. We've anniversaried some tough comps with the pacer growth that we had last year, and so we expect that to improve. But really, it was a comp issue for the quarter and it was offset by our strong growth in ICD, which is up 1% for the quarter, really being fueled by S-ICD. And the quarter really didn't reflect any Resonate benefit beyond what we saw in Europe \u2013 sorry, European's CRM business grew nicely on the heels of Resonate, which we will launch in \u2013 with earnest throughout 2018. Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll go to Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Can you hear me, okay? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Hi, Glenn. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Good morning, Glenn. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks. I want to focus on the ICD franchise. So, congratulations, you got MRI safe approved sooner than expected; at least, sooner than we thought. And if I go back to the impact of MRI pacing on your business \u2013 over a year ago, the business prior \u2013 your pacing business prior to MRI approval was declining, and then it started growing double-digits. So, wonder if you can help us think about how your ICD franchise should grow going forward now that you have MRI safe in the marketplace. And then, as a follow-up, at your analyst meeting back in June you talked about a replacement headwind for the U.S. ICD business for next year. Is that still on track, and can you remind us the impact for 2018? Thanks. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. So, we're very bullish on our position, particularly in Defib, as we close out 2017 and enter in 2018. As we articulated, that Resonate platform not only offers that MRI capability, but we believe that HeartLogic, that Ken can probably detail out a bit more, is a highly differentiated diagnostic tool for heart failure physicians that we'll be doing a number of clinical studies on. Then, you combine it with a longevity benefit. So, I think we're really well positioned with Resonate and S-ICD to take share in Q4 as well as throughout 2018 in Defib, which is clearly \u2013 is the highest profit margin business within CRM versus Pacer. So, we don't expect this to have the same level of growth rates that we saw when we had the Pacer MRI, because we had this MRI compatibility strategy with our current ICD and CRT-Ds. But nonetheless, we do expect to grow faster than market in Defib and expect faster growth in fourth quarter and in 2018 than we saw in 2017 in that business. And that'll also be combined with some benefits of a \u2013 more of a tailwind in replacements, which we talked about being about 100 basis points to CRM. So, we think we're very well positioned in the high margin Defib business with S-ICD and Resonate, as well as the tailwind, and also our strength in the EP business, which is up 18% in the quarter. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yes. Operator : And we'll go to Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, two for me. I wanted to start with \u2013 what struck me in the quarter was all of the regions except the U.S. accelerated on an organic basis. So, the U.S., I think, went from 7% to 2.8%. And I know you said weather was a pretty minor impact, but the amount of the impact, I think, was lower than some other companies have called out. And I guess my question is why the deceleration in the U.S.? And do you expect a benefit from Medtronic's issues in any business in the fourth quarter? And I had one follow-up. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yes. We didn't really want to overplay the weather card. We thought it was kind of 10 basis points to 20 basis points in the quarter, so had some impact and \u2013 but our teams did a really nice job. It had some impact on procedures, clearly, in Houston and in Florida. But overall, I think it just shows the balance and strength of the company, that diversified growth across Europe and Asia-Pac, and also, particularly with Europe's growth, which was a 9% operational growth with a benefit of a number of our new platforms, with the Eluvia, the DES, and the DCB, with the Resonate platform launching more quickly in Europe, as well as the impact of Symetis, as well as the growth of EP; it was significant in Europe. And again, all those platforms are coming to the U.S. So it gives us a lot of optimism for the U.S. growth as we head into 2018, 2019 and 2020 on the heels of these platforms that are performing very well in Europe. So, will there be upside from Medtronic's challenges? I think all companies have had challenges with Puerto Rico, and I think our team's done a really good job of limiting supply outages and having terrific contingency plans and backup resiliency plans in order to minimize those impacts that you're maybe seeing more strongly from other companies. Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. And then, Ian, I wanted to ask you one question. When you were asked this a couple quarters ago about LOTUS versus Symetis and the share, I think you said you expect them to be roughly 50/50 and it might have taken some people by surprise. I'm just wondering, at this point, do you still expect it to be 50/50 or is Symetis maybe picking up more, in your view? Thanks for taking the questions. Ian Meredith, M.D., Ph.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Larry. Probably, it's hard for me to comment fairly on market share. Obviously, you can see that ACURATE is doing very, very well in Europe. It's a very popular platform. I think it'll play out over time what the market share will be. Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Fair enough. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yes. I guess it just speaks to why we acquired Symetis in the first place. And we've talked about it for a while. We think the data for Symetis is very compelling, and Ian articulated that in terms of its performance against the best valves that Edwards and Medtronic has. We'll have a trial that will report that out. So, we have a lot of confidence in the clinical capabilities of Symetis and we have tremendous confidence in the unique abilities of LOTUS. And so, combined in a $5 billion market, which is a very small number for us today, we think it gives us the most unique growth profile in Structural Heart combined with WATCHMAN. And we're in the \u2013 I think we're not even \u2013 we're probably in the top of the first inning, still, in terms of our LOTUS opportunity as well as Symetis. Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : And we'll go to Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Can you hear me okay? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yes. Good morning. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Wonderful. Good morning. I have two questions for you. The first one has to do with gross margins. The commentary at the Analyst Day would imply a 50 basis point improvement next year, but this year you're absorbing 120 basis points from the FX headwind. And with FX shifting, walk me through, please, why this wouldn't be better next year? Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Well, obviously, we haven't given guidance yet, Joanne, relative to 2018. You're correct, it's 120 basis point headwind for the full year this year, and I think what's nice is that we basically will have offset that with operational improvements this year relative to the total number. So specific to next year, it's one of the numbers that'll add down to what we give for total guidance for operating margin and earnings per share and such for 2018. But the focus of the team relative to the operational improvements and the value improvement programs that we drive is alive and well. So, we'll need to sort that out relative to what FX will be next year. Again, the hope \u2013 as I mentioned to Mike Weinstein's question earlier, the hope is that with the rates where they are, we might see a little bit less of a headwind next year relative to the FX at the bottom line. But we'll give specific line item guidance when we give guidance in 2018. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. My follow-up question has to do with \u2013 sorry, another LOTUS question \u2013 LOTUS in the United States. Assuming the third module goes in at the end of this year or the beginning of next, what are the steps that you need to then take to get a timely mid-year approval for LOTUS in the United States? Thank you. Ian Meredith, M.D., Ph.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.: Well, once the PMA submission is completed, it will be just a case of answering any questions that are required to complete that submission. And it's just simply a process of dialogue with the FDA. We have frequent and very productive communication with the FDA. So, it's simply a process of meeting their expectations. There's obviously a timeline to the FDA approval process, and in that time we may be required to answer questions. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): But taking it a step further, what about manufacturing, ramp, productivity, sales force training? All that will be set in advance, I assume. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yes. Unfortunately, with the delays, we've had \u2013 we have commercial capability ready to go in the U.S. for LOTUS. They've been deployed elsewhere within our Cardiovascular team since they can't, obviously, sell LOTUS at this point. So, we have resources already established and we'll continue to strengthen and build upon that team. So, it won't be a commercial concern for us. And by the time we launch LOTUS in the U.S. at greater scale in the third quarter, we'll have been ramping up manufacturing significantly in the first half. So commercial capabilities and manufacturing should not be a concern for us when we launch in the U.S. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Terrific. Thank you very much. Have a good day. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks. Operator : We'll go to Matt Taylor with Barclays. Please go ahead. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask one about the balance sheet and use of cash, given you gave us an update on the settlement today. Can you talk us through a little bit how you're thinking about using your cash flow going forward as you're now going to be kind of out from under this overhang? Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yes, Matt. I think we've been pretty public about that in the past, and I don't think that really the timing of the payment for the IRS settlement really changes that. It's M&A and returning cash to shareholders are our two most favored uses of cash. I think we've balanced that well over the last four or five years, while at the same time settling a lot of legacy litigation liabilities and such. So, as we look forward to 2018, 2019, 2020, think back to Investor Day, we had talked about 90-plus percent of our cash over the next three years being able to go towards M&A and share repurchase over that timeframe, where it's been kind of the reverse of that over the last three or four years. So, I would look for M&A and share repurchase over that timeframe. And from an M&A perspective, there's plenty of opportunities out there to support our overall strategy of category leadership. I think you've seen that this year with a couple of the more notable ones we've done with Symetis and Apama, and I'd look for more of the same. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. And one follow-up, I just wanted to ask about your mitral program and how you're thinking about mitral options in repair and replacement? It's been a little bit of time since we've gotten an update there. Can you talk about what you have and if you need to add anything to the portfolio to be competitive? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. So, our focus clearly has been on the TAVR platforms, as you know, with LOTUS as well as ACURATE, as well as our WATCHMAN. And we think the size of the TAVR market is well over $5 billion, likely. And the WATCHMAN market, every point of penetration is $250 million; and, we continue to press on clinical and portfolio advantages there. So, we've been investing in the mitral area more with our VC investments, some of which have not been disclosed. So, we're interested in repair as well as replace. And we've really done more work on that through VC investments that we've made as well as a few internal, organic R&D opportunities. So, more to come on that. It's an area that we're interested in. We do think it'll be a significant market. We do think it'll play out longer than TAVR, given that it's more fragmented. So, expect us to continue to enhance our capabilities in that area, but it's not as much of a priority versus our atrial appendage and TAVR programs. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, guys. Susan Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: All right. Stacy, with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you very much, everyone, for listening in today. Apologies for the technical issues and, Stacy, if you could please give the replay information. Operator : Sure.

Ian Meredith - Executive Vice President and Global Chief Medical Officer Analysts : Michael Weinstein - J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. David Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc. Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Josh Jennings - Cowen & Co. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Boston Scientific Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and answer-session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Susie Lisa. Please go ahead. Susan Lisa : Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q4 2017 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Filings. The duration of this morning's call will be just under one hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights for Q4 2017 and full year 2017; Dan will review the financials for the quarter, and then Q1 2018 and full year 2018 guidance; and then, we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Global Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ian Meredith; and Chief Medical Officer for Rhythm Management and Global Health Policy, Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that, on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. And organic revenue growth is defined as excluding the impacts of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from the acquisitions of EndoChoice and Symetis over the relevant prior year period. Also note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate, goals and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q1 and full year 2018 guidance, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike? Michael Mahoney : Good morning. Thanks you, Susie. Thanks for dialing in. Boston Scientific delivered excellent financial results in fourth quarter 2017 with 8% operational revenue growth, 7% organic revenue growth, 190 basis point improvement in profitability and 14% adjusted EPS growth to $0.34. These fourth quarter results closed out a very strong 2017. For the full year, we delivered 8% operational revenue growth, 7% organic, against the 10% comp in 2016, which represents a 90 basis point improvement in profitability and 13% adjusted EPS growth to $1.16. Similarly, 2017 closed out a very strong three-year period for BSC, with an average operational revenue growth of 9%, organic growth of 7%, combined with a 480 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin, which leveraged that growth 2-times to an average 14.5% growth in adjusted EPS over the three-year period. So our strategy of category leadership in key markets and diversification in the high-growth adjacencies continues to deliver. Our goal is to continue to execute against our strategic planned goals, and execute similarly strong sales and EPS growth results over the next three years. It is the combination of long-term consistent above-market revenue growth, margin expansion and targeted double-digit EPS growth, now coupled with an improved ability to deploy strong free cash flow, that we believe uniquely positions Boston Scientific to deliver shareholder value. Accordingly, we are excited about our plans to build upon our global momentum in 2018 and beyond. We're targeting full year 2018 organic revenue growth of 5% to 6%. We're guiding to adjusted EPS of $1.35 to a $1.39, which represents 7% to 10% earnings growth. Importantly, this EPS growth includes an expected $0.02 to $0.03 negative impact from foreign exchange, which we'll seek to offset and deliver another year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. I'll now provide some highlights in fourth quarter and 2017 results along with thoughts on our 2018 outlook. All growth figures highlighted are on an organic basis over the prior year, unless otherwise noted. Our fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 7% continues to be broad-based across businesses and regions, led by our strong and diversified portfolio, continued global expansion and execution of our category leadership strategy. The ongoing diversification of our portfolio has helped drive excellent results with sales growth of 11% in MedSurg, 5% in cardiovascular and 3% in Rhythm Management. Four of the seven businesses grew revenue double digits, and we believe five of our seven businesses grew faster than the market. We also delivered another quarter of balanced global growth, led by 8% revenue in both the US and EMEA, and 4% growth in Europe. Emerging markets revenue grew 13%, led by 19% in China. The MedSurg business has continued to deliver. MedSurg grew 13% operationally and 11% organically in fourth quarter and now represents 39% of the revenue mix in the quarter. In Endo, we posted 10% organic and 13% operational growth in Q4 fueled by biliary, hemostasis and continued strong growth in the EndoChoice acquisition, which has now been part of the BSC team for over a year now and is fully integrated. Endo delivered 8% organic and 12% operational growth in full year 2017 sales, and we expect continued strength in our global Endo business in 2018. Uro and Pelvic Health also continued its excellent performance, growing sales 11% in fourth quarter, which is the eighth straight quarter of double-digit sales growth and 12% for the full year 2017. Our single-use digital ureteroscope, LithoVue helped drive double-digit growth in our core stone franchise. Prostate health also grew double-digits, while Men's Health grew single-digits. And also, the Minnetonka plant warning letter now has been lifted. And we anticipate a stronger new product cadence in our Men's Health business going forward. Boston Scientific continues to build the single-use market for ureteroscopy, while LithoVue now had over 700 accounts in the US and over 1,300 worldwide. Neuromodulation revenue grew 15% in the fourth quarter. We're excited about the future for this business in 2018 and beyond, with fast growing markets and new innovative product launches in both the spinal-cord stimulation and deep-brain stimulation franchises. Our WaveWriter SCS System is currently launching, and is the first and only platform approved by the FDA to simultaneously provide a paresthesia-based and sub-perception therapy for patients suffering chronic pain. We're also launching in the US our Vercise DBS platforms to treat Parkinson's disease. Vercise, is a rechargeable platform with a multiple independent control to offer more adaptable delivery of stimulation. Our Cardiovascular group grew 7% operationally in fourth quarter and 5% organically in both fourth quarter and full year. Our PI business Peripheral Interventions grew 7%, both in the quarter and for the full year. From a product sales standpoint, drug-eluting technology has led the away, but many franchises grew double digits, including stents, atherectomy, IVUS, and our CeloNova microspheres for interventional oncology procedures. We're seeing expanded use of a drug-eluting technologies in peripheral in Europe, and we continue to be the only manufacturer offering both the highly-effective drug-eluting stents and a drug-coated balloon. Both of our drug-eluting technologies are on track for U.S launches in 2019 for Eluvia, our drug-eluting stent, and in 2020 for Ranger, our drug-coated balloon. We expect data from Eluvia pivotal trial IMPERIAL to be presented in the second half of 2018. And earlier this week, we're encouraged by early COMPARE I trial data that was presented at the LEERINK conference in Leipzig, Germany. This is the first comparative data in the PI DCB space, looking at our Ranger DCB in a prospective multicenter randomized trial against Medtronic's IN.PACT, IN.PACT Admiral DCB. Ranger will be differentiated as the lowest profile of any DCB, utilizing the minimum effective dose of paclitaxel and builds upon our market-leading 0.018 Sterling platform balloon. We also expect to bring Ranger to the U.S. and Japan as the first DCB with the longest lengths available on the market. Intervention Cardiology continues its above-market growth trend, delivering a 4% organic and 7% operational revenue in the quarter, and for the full year of 4% organic and 6% operational. IC growth was led worldwide by continued strength of WATCHMAN, 10% growth in our complex PCI portfolio and mid-single-digit growth in PCI guidance. We also launched four new complex PCI products in the second half of 2017, as we continue to extend our lead in terms of depth and breadth of our complex PCI portfolio. We're targeting continued momentum in 2018 with new launches like the WOLVERINE cutting balloon and our next-generation rotational atherectomy platform called ROTAPRO. We also recently received FDA approval for a high-definition IVUS system, and expect to begin a limited market release this quarter, while we continue to rollout our new Comet FFR platform. As we disclosed earlier this month, 2017 structural heart revenue exceeded our guidance of $275 million, and WATCHMAN sales delivered $250 million. WATCHMAN has now treated over 3,000 [ph] patients globally, and we continue to drive growth via increasing utilization with existing customers, opening new centers and expanding the therapy geographically. Clinically, our efforts include indication expansion with the ASAP-TOO study in patients with absolute contradiction to oral anticoagulants. And we reported positive real world results and EWOLUTION WASP [ph] registries this year as well as the five year PROTECT AF PREVAIL meta-analysis. On the product development front, we target beginning enrollment in Q2 for the next-generation of WATCHMAN FLX in the PINNACLE FLX IDE trial and launching in Japan in 2019. WATCHMAN also received a 10.6% increase in its primary DRG reimbursement in the U.S. starting last October as well as reimbursement in Australia. We remain committed to educating patients and their caregivers about WATCHMAN, as an alternative to oral anticoagulants to help reduce the risk of bleeding and stroke. Our ACURATE TAVR program, a platform continues to build momentum in Europe, and we recently completed training of our European sales and clinical teams. We look forward to continued momentum as well as the launch of the next-generation ACURATE neo2 that incorporates an advanced seal in Europe in the second half of this year. We also remain on track to begin enrolling patients in our U.S. IDE for ACURATE in the second half of this year, and we'll confirm the trial details in the coming months. Regarding our LOTUS Edge TAVR valve platform, there's no change to our commentary from earlier this year in that pending our ability to clear certain technical and regulatory hurdles, our goal is to launch LOTUS Edge in the U.S. and European markets in 2019. Finally, in structural heart, last week, we announced exciting investment and acquisition option agreement with Millipede, a company that's developing a transcatheter mitral valve and Annuloplasty repair device to treat patients with severe mitral regurgitation. This is a large and currently underserved patient population that we estimate could represent $1 billion market opportunity by 2021. The Millipede IRIS Annuloplasty Ring delivered via transfemoral, transseptal delivery system follows the surgical standard of care to repair, and ultimately reduce the size of a dilated mitral annulus. This unique design in that is a complete - a unique design and that is a complete ring designed to be used as a standalone device or in combination with other technologies. It's also designed to be highly customizable to a specific patient's anatomy and disease state. We're pleased with the results of Millipede's first-in-human study, and a second first-in-human study will focus on improving the efficiency of the procedure. With WATCHMAN, ACURATE, LOTUS and now IRIS, we're excited about our structural heart capabilities and the long-term growth prospects of our structural heart business. For 2018, we expect revenue from our WATCHMAN and ACURATE TAVR franchise to deliver approximately $400 million in revenue. Global Rhythm Management sales grew 3% operationally and organically in Q4 and 4% for the full year. CRM sales grew 1% in the quarter and 2% for the full year 2017, while EP sales increased 18% in the quarter and 14% for the full year. CRM's 1% growth in Q4 reflects strong 6% growth in defib, offset by high single-digit declines in pacing due to tough comps post-April 2016 U.S. launch of our Brady MRI line. The 6% growth in defib reflects the impact of MRI conditional labeling in the U.S., the ongoing European and U.S. launches of our Resonate platform that contains HeartLogic Heart Failure alert, multipoint pacing MRI and best-in-class longevity with EnduraLife battery technology. EMBLEM S-ICD also continued to do extremely well and grew double digits for the full year 2017, while replacements are tracking to our expectations. Turning to EP, this franchise continues to build momentum, and we grew sales 18% for the quarter. The second-gen RHYTHMIA HDx platform, which provides significant improvements on workflow efficiency and performance, continues to be rolled out and enables our platform to support future innovative capabilities such as the recent European limited market release of our DirectSense catheters. DirectSense technology has received very positive early physician feedback in Europe and provides physicians with confidence in location, stability and proximity of the catheter to the tissue. Full launch of DirectSense is planned for the U.S. and Europe in 2018. We believe our strategy of category leadership is working and helping us to become a stronger partner to our global customers. We believe we are poised for a strong 2018, we're well positioned to continue and strengthen our performance track record in 2019 and beyond. Over the course of the next three years, we aim to expand into significant markets that represent an estimated $16 billion in opportunities, with strong margin improvement potential, a consistent tax rate and a greatly improved ability to deploy capital. I really want to thank our employees for the high-performance results, their winning spirit and commitment to advancing science and improving the lives of patients around the world. Now let me turn the call over the Dan for a detailed review of our financials. Daniel Brennan : Thanks, Mike. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue of $2,408 million represents 10% reported revenue growth and 8% growth on an operational basis, which excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency. The strong top line exceeded the high end of our operational guidance range of 5% to 6% due to outperformance across the majority of our businesses and regions, as Mike outlined. Our reported revenue reflects a $37 million tailwind from foreign exchange, basically in line with the $40 million tailwind expected at the time of guidance. Sales from the EndoChoice and Symetis acquisitions contributed approximately 130 basis points, which was also in line with our expectations at the time of guidance, resulting in a 7% organic revenue growth for the quarter. We delivered Q4 adjusted earnings per share of $0.34, which represents 14% year-over-year growth and is towards the high end of our guidance range of $0.32 to $0.35, driven primarily by that strong revenue growth. This includes a $0.02 headwind from FX, which was at the higher end of our range of $0.01 to $0.02. Our full year 2017 consolidated revenue of $9,048 million grew 8% operationally and on a reported basis and grew 7% organically. Full year 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.26, represents 13% growth our fifth straight year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, excluding the $0.08 foreign exchange headwind that we effectively offset throughout the operational savings and initiatives. Adjusted earnings per share grew 20% versus 2016. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 72.6% and flat to the prior year, but importantly, reflects our ability to offset a negative 200 basis point year-over-year impact from foreign exchange and pricing in line with what we have seen in prior years, with operational improvements and manufacturing cost reductions as well as favorable product mix due to the continued strength in our WATCHMAN and Men's Health franchises, to name a couple. For the full year 2017, adjusted gross margin was 72.1%, in line with the 72% adjusted gross margin for 2016, effectively offsetting a negative 130 basis point year-over-year impact from foreign exchange plus the LOTUS inventory charges in Q1 as well as the unfavorable variances incurred in our Puerto Rico facility due to Hurricane Maria in the third quarter. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $859 million or 35.7% of sales in Q4 2017, down 80 basis points year-over-year and within our guidance range of 35% to 36%. We remain committed to and continue to realize the benefit of our targeted initiatives focused on reducing SG&A, like, end-to-end business process streamlining and automation, expansion of global shared services, and leveraging global indirect sourcing. As a result of these initiatives, the full year 2017 adjusted SG&A rate of 35.6% is down 50 basis points versus the full year 2016. Adjusted research and development expenses were $256 million in the fourth quarter or 10.6% of sales, which is down 90 basis points from Q4 2016. And for the full year 2017, adjusted R&D expenses were $974 million or 10.8% of sales compared to 10.9% in 2016. Royalty expense was 0.7% of sales in Q4 and 0.8% for the full year 2017, roughly flat year-over-year for both periods. As a result, Q4 2017 adjusted operating margin of 25.6% increased 190 basis points year-over-year and was within our guidance range of 25.5% to 26.5%. Full year 2017, adjusted operating margin of 25% is an increase of 90 basis points over the full year 2016 and on target with the goals we established nearly five years ago at our 2013 Investor Day as we seek to continue to build our track record of delivering high performance and meeting or exceeding our long-term goals. The 90 basis point year-over-year improvement in our 2017 adjusted operating margin rate was largely driven by gains in our Rhythm Management and MedSurg segment operating results. The Rhythm Management team delivered an operating margin of 21.6% for Q4 and 19.7% for the full year 2017. This represents an impressive year-over-year operating margin increase of 620 basis points for Q4 and 470 basis points for the full year. The team continues to make strong progress on gross margin through favorable S-ICD and Resonate product portfolio mix as well as manufacturing efficiencies, while also focusing on expense control and leveraging the improved top line performance of both the global CRM and EP businesses. This improvement also reflects offsetting incremental spend related to the acquisition of Apama Medical and its single-shot pulmonary vein isolation technology that we announced in October. The MedSurg segment also realized significant year-over-year improvements of 290 basis points in the quarter, delivering Q4 operating margin of 34.3%. The full year rate of 32.3%, increased 100 basis points over the full year 2016. Investments in commercial capability for ongoing launches across MedSurg were more than offset by the strength in Endoscopy and Urology Pelvic Health, two of our highest operating margin businesses and improvements in Neuromodulation operating margin, with its recent commercial launches and resulting moderation in development spend. We recorded a net litigation-related charge of $89 million this quarter, related primarily to our mesh litigation. We have now reached conditional, final or near final settlement on approximately 44,000 of our approximately 49,000 claims. However, as we do each quarter, we review the volume of known claims, the estimated cost to resolve each claim, an estimate of future claims and the cost to defend each claim in order to calculate the required reserve and make any necessary adjustments. Having now settled or reached agreement in principle with approximately 90% of all known claims, we continue to reduce the risk on our balance sheet and are targeting a resolution of the majority of our mesh claims in 2018. Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $1,612 million as of December 31, 2017. And importantly, for 2018, we expect to make cash payments of approximately $800 million, which will fund the settlement of remaining legal reserves related to the mesh litigation and minimize this liability on our balance sheet, given the cash payments we've already made in prior quarters into the qualified settlement funds. This combined with our expected payment to finalize our disputes with the Internal Revenue Service for approximately $600 million during 2018, requires approximately $1.4 billion of cash flow to settle our remaining significant existing contingencies. Therefore, in 2018, we expect to have approximately $500 million of cash flow for our other, more strategic uses. I'll give more detail on our cash flow guidance in a minute. Now I'll move to below the line and interest and other expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $56 million, roughly flat to Q4 of 2016. Our average interest expense rate was 3.8% in Q4 of 2017, and 4% in Q4 of 2016. Adjusted other expense was $31 million in the fourth quarter and primarily included a $19 million impairment on certain of our available-for-sale investments as well as foreign exchange losses related to our hedging program. For the full year, interest expense and adjusted other expense were $229 million and $57 million respectively, slightly below our expected $300 million for the full year. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 371.1% [ph] on a reported basis and 9.5% on an adjusted basis. On an adjusted basis, the favorability in our tax rate was due to a better-than-expected geographic mix of profit and certain discrete tax items. Our reported tax rate includes an estimated one-time net income charge of $861 million resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This estimate includes approximate $1 billion charge related to the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, offset by a $100 million benefit related to the remeasurement of the company's deferred taxes as a result of the lower U.S. corporate tax rate. The net of these two items is the approximate $861 million one-time charge. Importantly, we expect to be able to utilize certain tax benefits such as NOL and R&D credits, and thus anticipate the cash impact of these charges will be approximately $450 million which is very manageable considering it's paid out over a period of eight years. Our full year tax rate was 88.8% on a reported basis and 11.2% on an adjusted basis. Finally, Q4 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $0.34, includes approximately $0.02 of unfavorable foreign exchange and represents 14% year-over-year growth or 23% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, which includes the one-time net income tax charge and other net charges, and amortization expenses totaling $1,095 million after tax, Q4 2017 was a loss per share of $0.45. For the full year 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 reflects the higher end of our guidance range, while absorbing the $0.08 of unfavorable foreign exchange. Full year 2017, adjusted earnings per share grew 13% over the prior year and 20% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, 2017 EPS was $0.08 compared to full year 2016 GAAP income per share of $0.25. We ended Q4 with 1,393 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $685 million compared to $472 million in Q4 of 2016. And in the quarter we used cash primarily to fund previously agreed upon legal settlements as well as business development activities, namely the Apama Medical acquisition that I mentioned. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash on hand of $188 million. Our full year 2017 adjusted free cash flow of $1,729 million represents 7% year-over-year growth, but fell slightly short of our $1,750 million cash flow guidance. The shortfall was primarily related to working capital. I'll detail 2018 guidance in a moment, but we continue to expect 2018 adjusted cash flow to be approximately $1.9 billion. Capital expenditures for the full year 2017 totaled $319 million, in line with our $320 million target, which included expenditures for strategic investments expected to build capacity and drive growth. We expect capital expenditures to be at similar levels for 2018. So now I'll walk through guidance for Q1 and full year 2018. For the full year 2018, we expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $9,650 million to $9,800 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 5% to 6% on an organic basis, with an additional 30 basis point contribution from the Symetis acquisition. We expect foreign exchange to be a tailwind of approximately $150 million to $175 million for the full year 2018. However, as I'll detail next, due to our hedging program, we do not expect to see the same benefit in our adjusted gross margin or earnings per share. We expect our adjusted gross margin for the year, as a percentage of sales, to be approximately 72% for the full year, which assumes a negative FX impact of 110 basis points. As a reminder, we lock in our foreign currency hedges up to 3 to 5 years in advance, depending on the currency, so we do not benefit from the recent currency movements. As a result, the upside in reported sales, primarily from the strengthening of the euro, has no associated gross profit benefit and thus our gross margin rate is negatively impacted. We expect this headwind to be partially offset by favorable mix, standard cost reduction program, and the ramp of accretive new products. As we look forward to 2019 and 2020 if rates were to remain constant, we'd expect a neutral to slightly positive impact from foreign exchange on results in those two years. We expect full year adjusted SG&A to be in the range of 34.5% to 35% of sales as we continue to see the benefits of programs currently underway. In 2018, we will again reinvest the full benefit of the medical device excise tax expansion with strong investments in structural heart and other exciting durable growth platforms. Full year adjusted research and development is expected to be in a range of 10% to 11%. And we expect our royalty rate to remain at slightly less than 1% of sales for 2018. This implies a full year 2018 adjusted operating margin in a range of 25.5% to 25.75%, which is consistent with the improvement goals we outlined on January 9, and sets us up well to deliver on our long-term goal of 28% adjusted operating margin in 2020. We forecast our full year 2018 adjusted tax rate to be between 13% and 14%. This assumes an operational tax rate of approximately 14% to 15%, which is lower than the 16% we expected in early January as a result of additional analysis and clarity on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In addition, we expect an approximate 100 basis point benefit to the operational tax rate from the accounting standard for stock compensation compared to the approximate 200 basis point benefit we had in 2017 as a result of the US tax rate declining from 35% to 21%. In 2019 and beyond, we now expect a similar long-term effective tax rate between 14% and 15%, with full access to our global cash. We expect below-the-line expenses, which include interest payments, dilution from our VC portfolio and costs associated with our hedging program to be approximately $300 million for the year, and fully diluted weighted average share-count of approximately 1,399 million shares for the first quarter and 1,402 million for the full year. As a result, we expect full year 2018 adjusted EPS to be in a range of $1.35 to $1.39, representing 7% to 10% adjusted earnings growth, despite headwinds from a full year negative impact of foreign exchange of approximately $0.02 to $0.03. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.93 to $0.98. Now, turning to Q1 2018, we expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of 2,320 million to 2,350 million. This represents year-over-year organic growth in a range of 4% to 5% versus a 9% growth comparison in Q1 2017, with an additional 80 basis point operational growth contribution from Symetis. We expect the foreign exchange impact on Q1 revenue to be a $60 million to $70 million tailwind. For the first quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.30 to $0.32 per share, representing 5% to 12% growth and GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.19 to $0.22 per share. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2017 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q4 and full year results as well as Q1 and full year 2018 guidance, including P&L line item guidance. So with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A. Susan Lisa : Thanks, Dan. Greg, let's open it up to questions for the next 20 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take us many as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Greg, please go ahead. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein : Good morning, guys. And thanks for the taking the questions. Let me start, I mean, we got a chance to talk a little bit about the quarter in San Francisco. And obviously, this is an extremely strong quarter on the tough comp for you. There are some discussion already on the Street about kind of what the first quarter ends up looking like. I think we get a sense for how you're thinking about it with your guidance here. But with you guys showing such a strong fourth quarter, the industry in general having a strong fourth quarter, do you have a feel for how you're thinking about the first quarter? And should it be conservative just relative to what we saw here in 4Q? Michael Mahoney : Sure, good morning, Mike. Yeah, we're very comfortable with our 5% to 6% full-year growth. We gave visibility to first quarter with 4% to 5%. As you said, we do have good momentum coming out of the company across the businesses with MedSurg delivering very well, WATCHMAN, PI, really across the board. We do have some headwinds in 2018 that we'll be facing. We do have some tough - difficult pacer comps. We have some more DES competition with some new entrants that we expect some trialing. We expect to maintain our share over the term, but we expect some trialing early on. We also see some one-time price cuts in Australia and Japan that have a bit more impact in 2018 and that will be neutralized in 2019. So overall, the business is performing very well. There are few headwinds and we're comfortable with the 5% to 6%. And gave you good line of sights and they are 4% to 5% for the quarter. Michael Weinstein : Okay. Let me ask you just couple of other items. One, first off, thanks for giving the detailed number on WATCHMAN. That was obviously appreciated. WATCHMAN has a ton of momentum. It sounds like the fourth quarter in particular was very strong for WATCHMAN. Can you just give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing amongst interventional cardiologist and electrophysiologist, and who seems to be really getting on board with WATCHMAN usage and who's driving it? And then, second, could you spend just a minute on the Millipede transaction? I thought the structure of the deal was obviously very interesting. Effectively, you will be acquiring the company, but it keeps it off your P&L for the next two years. Why was that the right technology? And why was this the right asset to buy in mitral? Thanks. Michael Mahoney : Thanks, Mike. I'll talk to a little bit of WATCHMAN and then I'll have - then we'll also talk about Millipede. And so, on the WATCHMAN the teams are doing a terrific job. We continue to open up centers, on track. But more importantly, we're improving utilization of the product and the therapies. We're increasing awareness amongst the referring physicians. We're training more physicians. And we're also expanding globally into China, and we will launch into Japan in 2019. So I think the overall momentum is just excellent clinical outcomes, more physicians, training in the product as well as just increasing awareness. And our focus is on improving utilization rates at these large centers each quarter. So we're very, very bullish on the platform. And as you know, we've only had about 1% of the utilization rate at $250 million. So you will continue to see us invest aggressively there. Maybe Dr. Stein can make a comment on the clinical work with WATCHMAN, and then we'll touch on Millipede. Kenneth Stein : Yeah, thanks, Mike. And, Mike, I think, the key behind the momentum has been the great results that we've seen, both in the clinical trials, really pleased with the results that were presented at TCT, the final five-year results, combined meta-analysis, protecting from fail, leaving really no reasonable doubt, but that this is at least as effective as warfarin for stroke prevention. And I think you've seen that translate into the market as well as really the extraordinarily good safety results that we've seen as a result of our training program and disciplined approach to bringing new sites online. We see balanced interest between IC and EP implanters. And I think both sides have the skill that's required to do the implant and the results show that both sides are doing it well and doing it effectively. Michael Mahoney : And on the Millipede transaction, we like the structure where we organized it. I think you outlined it pretty well. We aim to purchase this company once they're complete with a - their second-gen fam [ph] if you call it or - likely by the end of this year. That maybe, Ian, you can touch on kind of a rationale for Millipede. Ian Meredith : Yeah, thanks, Mike. And thank you, Mike, good question. The rationale behind Millipede, it's based on very sound physics principles and logically correct for path of physiology of functional mitral regurgitation. As you know, it follows the surgical predicate in that you have a complete annuloplasty ring. And it's a small footprint device, transfemoral, transapical catheter repair, so not using the apex, which is a huge impasse on patients with significant left ventricle impairment to start with. And it provides some line of sight to tricuspid valve repair and obviously mitral valve replacement in the future. And more importantly, it doesn't limit or preclude the use of any other therapies and - that is particularly important because mitral valve repair is often a multifaceted approach leaflet and chord repair can still be done in this context. So we thought that we - there were 8 criteria that we would want for a transcatheter mitral valve repair foundational device and this meets all of those 8 foundational criteria. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Lewis : Good morning. One quick question on structural heart for me and then I have quick follow-up. Mike, I'm just thinking about the structural heart guidance you gave for 2018, which I thought was pretty interesting. I mean, the $400 million number, I wonder if you can provide some context around that. Because given the strong WATCHMAN number in 2017, as you're probably aware, WATCHMAN virtually slowed very marginally in 2017 versus 2016, very aggressive growth. To do $400 million 2018, if I just take your NeoTract annualization off the fourth quarter and very substantial deceleration in WATCHMAN, you get above $400 million. So help us frame up that $400 million number because it sort of implies a lot of WATCHMAN deceleration or frankly is a very conservative way to think about the year to start the year. Michael Mahoney : Oh, we've definitely taken the NeoTract numbers out of our numbers. Just kidding you there. But on the WATCHMAN, I think overall, we aim to deliver against our commitments and we continue to do so. So we feel very bullish on the platform. We don't have as many new centers opening in the U.S. We penetrated that quite a bit. We saw a few new centers. And we have some major launches coming more so in 2019 in terms of U.S. - really, Japan. But we feel comfortable with that guidance number. And hopefully, we continue to do well, whether we'll be able to have opportunity to increase it as the year goes on. David Lewis : Sorry for the Freudian slip there, Mike. We'll move on Michael Mahoney : The only thing I'll comment on is on Symetis, as part of that. This - that business continues to increase. We've trained our clinical and our sales teams on it. So we expect some acceleration of Symetis in 2018. And the approval - that second generation platform, early third quarter will really be critical, because it already has a very low pacemaker rate, very, very quick to implant, and this will even reduce the PVL rate further and we have those two large clinical trials that we'll also report on. So I think you'll see strong momentum out of WATCHMAN and Symetis this year in 2018. David Lewis : Okay. And then just the financial question is for me. Dan, you - tax rate came in a little lower than we thought. Could you just to talk us, what drives the low end and high end of the earnings range? I think we initially thought 50 basis points of leverage this year. Maybe with the - you've got more flexibility now with the lower tax rate. So how are you thinking about leverage in 2018? And from balance sheet perspective, I think a lot of investors are interested on, like, what you think your capacity is towards the back half of this year? Is it $750 million? Is it $1 billion? And where do those priorities sit versus acting under venture portfolio versus externally driven M&A? Thanks so much. Daniel Brennan : Sure, David. So on the tax rate, in early January we had talked about the 16%. That was the best read at that time. And frankly, now that we've had more time to crawl through it and there's been more clarity, we think the 14% to 15% from an operational rate perspective is a good call for 2018. And then, keep in mind the all-in tax rate is 100 basis points lower than that, just given the ASU on stock comp. In terms of the leverage, if you look at the ranges that we have down through the P&L, you get the outcomes at the different ranges that we have for EPS. So the lower tax rate is helpful, but the margin goal of 50 to 75 basis points over 2017 is exactly what we said in early January, it's in line with that. We think that sets us up well to get to that 28% by 2020. The - really, the only one that's a bit stuck on that is the gross margin, and that's just the FX impact that we'll see in 2018 and that hopefully turns to a tailwind in 2019 and 2020. So I think, all tends to line up well in terms of very solid leverage in 2018 and then probably acceleration of that leverage in 2019 and 2020. And then the balance sheet. Balance sheet is probably as healthy it's been in 10-plus years when you look at it relative to our capacity and our debt and leverage ratios. So we're down in the low-tows now. We sit very well with that. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we should have roughly $500 million kind of left over from the $1.9 billion goal that we have this year for cash flow, for more strategic uses in the back half after we take care of the rest of mesh and IRS tax case. So that going into 2019 and 2020, as we've said very publicly, as we sit with the balance sheet today, we don't have a lot of call on that cash. So as you look at what should be north of $2 billion in each of those years, that's really the exciting part that we get to put even more in strategic uses. I don't know, Mike, you have any other comment on that? Michael Mahoney : Yeah, you summarized it. We've - on the venture portfolio, we have a number of investments that we like. And I think we've commented in the past, you'll likely see three or four potential acquisitions months within that venture portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel. Please go ahead. Frederick Wise : Good morning, everybody. Maybe just starting with the balance sheet, again, Dan. Maybe talk about your cash flow priorities, or Mike maybe you want to talk about it as well as we think about 2018 unfolding and into2019 and 2020. From here, is it going to be continued M&A? Is that's the number one priority? Or help us think about share buyback as well. Michael Mahoney : Yeah. That's the sequence that you laid out is the priority. One is, we had to finish the mesh pay down and tax, which we're doing this year. And then, we'll really have much more freedom as you look at second half of 2018 and then going forward once those are retired. We do have a pretty active M&A appetite. We have a venture portfolio that's pretty healthy, that we have some preferred rights to buy a number of those companies. So I think you'll see us be active with tuck-in acquisitions to strengthen our category leadership strategy. But to the extent that we don't find strategic deals that meet our financial criteria then we would look at share repurchase, more likely share repurchase, more likely in 2019 than 2018. Frederick Wise : That's great. And just last for me. It's sort of a long haul, but impressive pipeline and beautifully laid out in the charts and the tables, maybe just from your perspective, Mike or Ian, you could highlight the parts that you think have the most outsized potential in the 2018 through 2020 period to drive growth and expanding margins. Is that Symetis? Is it margin you see around, et cetera? And just last on the stent business. How do we think about it from here? You said you think you're going to hold share in 2018. But does that mean, Mike, that the business is flat or down because of price? A little more color there on maybe the potential headwind or risk in 2018. Thanks a lot. Michael Mahoney : Sure. We have a - the beauty of that portfolio, it's very diversified. So we have a number of important growth drivers. I won't hit all of them, but just a couple just to highlight. S-ICD continues to grow double-digit, and then we'll eventually get the modular pacemaker on S-ICD, Resonate is a new platform there. We touched on WATCHMAN before, which is really a strong growth driver with great margins. Very bullish on ACURATE. We aim to bring Lotus to the market in 2019. Endo has a full suite of products, guys, I don't want to go through all of them, I think the strength of the company right now - and also, I'll just mention two big platforms, the spinal cord stim and DPS. So it's a very diversified company now. And each business has really some key platforms that are launching either this year or if the cadence actually gets stronger in 2019 and 2018. On DES, we continue to believe that SYNERGY based on zero stent thrombosis and its ease of use is the best stent of the marketplace continue to grow that business, although very slowly, but we grow it in Europe. In Europe it seem - faced more competitors than the U.S. We expect some headwinds in the U.S., we think more temporarily as physicians may try the DES platform. But importantly, for our coronary business, the other business that surrounds DES is our complex PCI business and that business is growing 10% last year. And it's 80% the size of DES. So I think you'll see maybe by the end of 2018 or 2019, those businesses especially the same size. So we expect, really, any softness in DES will be tempered by the growth in our Complex PCI business, where we continue to launch new platforms. So I think we will see some - likely some headwinds with some trialing, but that will be buffered with Complex PCI, then we're confident based on what we've seen Europe, doctors will stay with synergy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Robert Hopkins : Well, thanks and good morning. Michael Mahoney : Good morning. Robert Hopkins : So, first question. I just want to clarify from a big picture perspective the 2018 earnings guidance. It's obviously in the slides, you can nicely see that you're guiding to 7% to 10% EPS growth in 2018. But, Mike, I think in your prepared comments, you said that you hope to be able to offset some FX and therefore maybe 10% is more likely. I just want to make sure that I heard that right. Is that the message on earnings growth for 2018? Michael Mahoney : No, I think the message is that the range is 7% to 10%. Within that 7% to 10%, the goal is to offset that $0.02 to $0.03 negative FX as we've done in the past few years, offsetting the FX impact. But I don't point to one number more likely than the other. The range is 7% to 10%. Robert Hopkins : Okay. And just the reason I asked that is because at J.P. Morgan, the slides were pretty clear. You expect or you were hoping for double-digit earnings growth. And I'm just - with the lower tax rate. I guess, I was just a little surprised the guidance was a bit higher on the earnings side. So maybe, Dan, you can talk just a little bit about some of the things that prevents you from just guiding to 10% or better? Thank you. Daniel Brennan : Well, I think as we've said, we have a pretty good track record of hitting or exceeding the goals that we have put out over the last few years. As you look at that range, 10% is at the high end of the guidance range. And obviously, that's our goal, right, our goals is always double digits. But the range is - it contemplates the outcomes of 7% to 10%. As you look down the different, various elements of the P&L, and this is a bit getting to Mike's question earlier gross margin is really the only one where you don't see a solid amount of progress in 2018 and that's really the foreign exchange impact that we have to offset in 2018. Other than that, at the midpoint of SG&A, you're seeing almost 100 basis points of improvement. And that's what we've been saying over the last few quarters is that SG&A is a big driver of that operating margin improvement story and that's solid progress in 2018 and more to come in 2019 and 2020. So at the 25 we were in 2017, and then the 50 to 75 basis points this year. And then what should be a much better years for FX in 2019 and 2020, I think we're well on track to have a solid year this year and get to that 28% by 2020. Robert Hopkins : Okay. Very fair, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen. Please go ahead. Josh Jennings : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Michael Mahoney : Good morning, Josh. Josh Jennings : I wanted to follow-up on - good morning - on the operating margin trajectory out through to 2020 and how we should be thinking about the cadence of operating margin expansion in 2019 and 2020? Is there anything, Dan, that we should be thinking about in 2019, potentially Lotus launch or FX headwinds getting lighter on the gross margin line, in terms of that 240 basis points-ish of operating margin expansion left to that - for that 28% target? Michael Mahoney : Yeah, so I think you're kind of using the midpoint of this year and saying there's 240 left at the end of this year to get to that 28 by 2020, which I think is fair. Certainly, leveraging our Lotus launch, as Mike said, that's goal in 2019 in the US. Leveraging that will be helpful because we have a certain amount of commercial infrastructure that's in place, ready to go there. So leveraging that would be helpful. But then, the rest of the P&L and just the - if you look at the ranges for revenue, we talk about 5 to 6 this year. We've talked about 5 to 8 for 2019 and 2020 as we have a good launch year, this year in 2018. But we are setup for 2019 and 2020 to be even better product launch year. So I think there is a natural opportunity for a topline leverage in 2019 and 2020, plus the continued focus that we have on SG&A, and then the FX relents a little bit in 2019 and 2020. So you should see better gross margin and less of a drag from an EPS perspective. So I think the - if you look at the 50 to 75 this year and then, say, we need 240 to get to that 28 by 2020, I think the pieces are in place to get there. Josh Jennings : Great. And then just a quick follow-up on the mitral valve portfolio, you guys are - the Millipede investment was nice to see. How are you thinking about building out the mitral valve-specific transcatheter pipeline? Is there anything internal that we should be remembering? And do you think you need a replacement device to fully capitalize on that opportunity over the next couple of years? Thanks for taking the questions. Kenneth Stein : Thanks very much. And perhaps I can take that question. I think we do have internal programs as well. And as you know, repairing the mitral valve is often the multi-factorial approach and you need more than one solution to repair the mitral valve. But the primary foundation of mitral valve repair, particularly, functional mitral regurgitation, is the angioplasty, and that can actually serve to treat functional mitral regurgitation in a large proportion of patients. So we see this as the foundational move in them and their critical first step in building a mitral program but it's certainly the lion's share of that program. Obviously, this does provide us the line of sight down the track to a mitral valve replacement option and indeed tricuspid valve repair as well. It's not the immediate aim, and the immediate aim is to get through the clinical trials and launch a transcatheter mitral valve repair device from a transeptal approach, which I think everybody is yearning for. Michael Mahoney : Yes, we think this platform serves, clearly as a repair device immediately. Then potentially replacement as well as tricuspids. So we think that's the unique benefit of this platform. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, so maybe one on WATCHMAN. Really strong performance in 2017. Maybe, Mike, can you comment on what portion of the drill came from the new center adds versus same center volume growth? I think that would be helpful. Michael Mahoney : Yeah, we don't break that out for you. But as you might expect, early on, a few years ago it was new centers that were opening up. But now, call it 80/20 practically, just roughly. Vijay Kumar : And that's helpful, that's helpful. Michael Mahoney : Much more so on utilization of increased utilization of same-store. I shouldn't say same-store, utilization of our facilities that are open and less on new openings. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Mike. And, Dan, one on FX hedges I think the comments you made about 3 to 5 years out you guys hedged. Is this now, I assume, this is now a below the line item, right? And given three to five year hedges, like is this now - does this now have impact for 2019 as well? Daniel Brennan : Yeah, I think it's not a below the line impact. The cost associated with the hedging program are shown below the line, but the actual settlement of the contract - the hedging contract are shown in gross margin, which is why the - we've had that headwind in gross margin in the last two to three years from an FX perspective. So to be clear, this year we expect 110 basis points of headwind in FX, related to gross margin. When you get to 2019 and 2020, if the rates were to hold where they are today, it becomes a much better story, where it's neutral to slightly favorable for us, both at the gross margin line and then at the FX line as well. So 2019 and 2020 is a much better FX story than it has been for the last three-plus years. Vijay Kumar : Thank you, guys. Susan Lisa : Okay. With that, we'd like to conclude the call.

Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Boston Scientific First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Susie Lisa. Please go ahead. Susan Vissers Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q1 2018 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information. The duration of the morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights of Q1 2018. Dan will review the financials for the quarter and then give Q2 2018 and full year 2018 guidance. And then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith and Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, organic revenue growth is defined as excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from the acquisition of Symetis over the relevant prior year period. Also of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate, and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q2 and full year 2018 guidance, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend, and other expenses. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such difference include those described in the risk factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thank you, Susie. Good morning, everyone. Boston Scientific continues to build on our consistent and strong track record. After three years of top tier results, we've begun 2018 with another quarter of strong revenue growth and increased profitability while continuing to invest for a very exciting future. In first quarter our team delivered 6.2% operational revenue growth and 5.2% organic revenue growth with another quarter of excellent balance across our businesses and geographic regions. The 5.2% organic growth was also notable against our highest growth comp of the year, as we grew 9.4% organically in Q1 2017. We leveraged our first quarter revenue growth to deliver 14% adjusted EPS growth to $0.33 and generated $283 million in adjusted cash flow. We're also excited about 2018 and our plans to build upon our global momentum and drive sustainable long-term growth and differentiated financial performance. So, given our confidence in the outlook of the balance of the year, we are raising the high end of the full year 2017 organic revenue growth guidance. Our prior range of 5% to 6% is now 5% to 7%, plus an additional approximate 40 basis point contribution from the Symetis acquisition. I'm also pleased that, as a result of our first quarter performance, plus the improved full year revenue outlook, we're raising our full year 2018 adjusted EPS guidance from $1.35 to $1.39, to a range of $1.37 to $1.41, representing 9% to 12% year-on-year growth. Importantly, we also continue to invest in meaningful innovation to further strengthen our category leadership strategy and drive organic revenue and EPS growth over the long term. During the quarter, we announced four compelling tuck-in acquisitions and one investment : NxThera and nVision in Urology and Pelvic Health, EmCision in Endoscopy, Securus in EP, and Millipede in Structural Heart. These acquisitions will strengthen our faster growth core oriented business and enable over $16 billion in exciting new market expansion opportunities by 2021. So before I discuss the business results, I'd like to review the changes we also announced earlier today in our reporting segments, which reflected better alignment in our geographic regions and businesses. Geographically, we've now combined our Middle East and Africa organizations with Europe to create the EMEA region, which results in a standalone Asia-Pac region that no longer includes the Middle East and Africa. Additionally, we've also realigned our global Neuromodulation business to now be included with our Rhythm Management reporting segments, which includes Cardiac Rhythm Management and EP. We are renaming this segment Rhythm and Neuro, and we see benefits of bringing our active implantable devices closer together across both the cardiac and neuro markets, as this is better aligned with our shared manufacturing facilities and can drive further capabilities and best practices. As a result of this move, our MedSurg segment now includes Endo and Uro/Pelvic Health and after 29 years at Boston Scientific, Mike Phalen has retired and we wish him the very best and thank him for his great contribution to BSC over these many years. I'll now provide some highlights on first quarter results and thoughts on our full year 2018 outlook. In my remarks, all references to growth are organic, year over year, unless otherwise specified. So regionally in first quarter, we delivered strong and balanced growth with both EMEA and Asia-Pac growing 6%, U.S. 5%, and emerging markets gaining 17%. Strength in the Asia-Pac region was broad based, and China once again delivered 23% growth. We also delivered balanced growth across all of our businesses. As to realigned, the MedSurg business grew 7%, Rhythm and Neuro grew 6%, and Cardiovascular was up 3%. So I'll now share some details on some of the drivers. In Endo we posted 6% growth fueled by strong pathology and infection prevention performance as well as sales of our SpyGlass DS visualization platform, Axios Stent and continued the option of Resolution 360 hemostasis. In addition, we're excited about the early launch of our endoluminal surgery portfolio, including the Orise platform which provides a novel means of diagnosing and treating cancers of the GI tract solely through natural orifice. In early March, we also acquired EmCision, which offers an endoscopic bipolar RF device that coagulates tissue and relieves duct obstruction, which helps improve quality of life in patients who are living with pancreatic biliary cancers. Our Uro and Pelvic Health business continued a strong performance trend, growing sales 9% in first quarter led by sales of LithoVue, our single-use digital ureteroscope, as well as products for Men's Health, core stone, and BPH. Emerging market sales in Uro and Pelvic Health were strong, growing 30%, and our Greenlight therapy for BPH posted a solid growth, particularly internationally, as we continue to invest in training, while leveraging BSC's strong global infrastructure. We also intend to strengthen and expand our leadership position in BPH with the recent acquisition of NxThera, and NxThera's developed the Rez\u016bm system, which uses water vapor to remove excess prostate tissue, thereby alleviating obstruction to urine flow and reducing BPH-related systems (sic) [symptoms]. This is a very strong complementary offering to our existing Greenlight laser therapy. Minimally invasive therapies are expanding the market beyond pharmaceuticals for the estimated 110 million worldwide diagnosed with BPH. And Rez\u016bm's key advantages are that it's simple, in-office procedure provides differentiated relief from symptoms, and data to date indicate superior durability of results and thus limited need for re-intervention. Also, last week's announcement of the acquisition of nVision Medical is really an important and potentially game changing opportunity for women at risk for ovarian cancer and for Boston Scientific. nVision will become part of the Surg-Gyn business and we're hopeful that the nVision platform can change the landscape of ovarian cancer, which is the fifth most deadly cancer among women, given the lack of a reliable diagnostic and resulting late stage detection. We're also hopeful that the platform may one day limit the estimated 300,000 preventative surgeries done each year in the U.S. to remove ovaries and fallopian tubes, 90% of which prove to be benign. Ovaries, I should say. Studies indicate that there are 400,000 women in the U.S. who are high risk, who would be near term candidates to benefit from the nVision diagnostic procedure. We believe this diagnostic platform could ultimately result in a $500 million to $1 billion U.S. market opportunity. We plan to make nVision commercially available in the first half of 2019 and will continue to invest in clinical work to support the widest possible adoption of this platform. Rhythm and Neuro grew 6% in the quarter led by 17% growth in Neuro, 11% in EP, and 2% in CRM. Neuro revenue grew growth of 17% in the first quarter, was driven by U.S. launches of our WaveWriter Spinal Cord Stim system and Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation platforms. In addition, our international investments in Neuro are starting to pay off as we delivered 30% plus growth outside the U.S. We're also very encouraged by the initial physician and patient clinical experience with the WaveWriter SCS launch and its unique ability to offer combined waveform therapies both with paresthesia and sub-perception. In DBS yesterday at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting, we presented the one-year results from the landmark INTREPID study. This is the first and only multicenter, double-blind randomized sham-controlled study in the field of deep brain stimulation. In this study, the use of Vercise DBS demonstrated a 49% improvement in motor systems in patients with advanced but responsive Parkinson's disease. This represents a greater benefit when compared to other DBS systems researched to date. We look forward to ongoing strong growth in Neuromodulation and the launch of our next generation DBS platform with directional lead in the second half of 2018. Global CRM sales grew above market at 2%, led by double-digit growth in defib sales, reflecting a very strong global launch of our Resonate platform which includes the HeartLogic heart failure alert as well as continued double-digit growth of Emblem S-ICD. The expected benefit from our device replacement cycle is also tracking to expectations. We are now the number two global share player in the high-voltage market. Customer interest in HeartLogic is increasing as heart failure practitioners recognize the value of the only FDA approved heart failure alert which doesn't require maintenance data monitoring. We also continue to enroll patients in the first stage of Manage AF (sic) [HF], which is a multicenter randomized trial designed to quantify the benefit of proactive heart failure management using HeartLogic. S-ICD's strong global growth continues and we're pleased to announce that it is now included in Physician Society of Recommendations in both the U.S. and Europe, placing S-ICD on equal footing to transvenous ICDs for patients who don't need pacing or ATV therapy. Brady pacing grew below market in first quarter as we faced a tough comp and lost some modest share due to competitive launches. While we expect brady pacing sales could remain likely a headwind for the full year 2018, given the strong global momentum of our defib portfolio in both CRTD and ICD, we are confident that our worldwide CRM business will continue to grow above market in 2018. EP sales grew 11% in the quarter led by good growth in our Rhythmia HDx mapping and nav platform. We also continue to strengthen our catheter portfolio with the upcoming European full launch of our DirectSense and IntellaNav MiFi ablation catheter. We also announced a small EP acquisition in April, Securus Medical, which has developed a thermal monitoring system for continuous measurement of esophageal temperature to avoid thermal injury during left atrial ablation procedures. We expect a launch in mid-2019, post completion of manufacturing scale-up activities. Also, please join us for an update and webcast on our Rhythm Management and WATCHMAN programs at HRS on Friday, May 11 at 12 :15, and please note this is a scheduling change from Thursday to Friday. Our Cardiovascular group grew 3% in first quarter 2018. PI grew at 6% in the quarter, led by strong growth in both Europe and Asia. Europe, in particular, is delivering a strong growth due to our innovative drug-eluting technologies with both the Ranger DCB and Eluvia DES, as well as our JetStream atherectomies platform. We're now targeting drug-eluting U.S. launches in first half 2019 for Eluvia DES and in 2020 for Ranger DCB. Preliminary COMPARE-1 DCB data was presented in first quarter at the LINC Congress in Leipzig, Germany. This is the first randomized controlled head-to-head trial of DCBs, and the preliminary results suggested similar patency with our next generation lower drug dose Ranger DCB versus the higher dose IN.PACT DCB. Our Interventional Cardiology business grew 1% in the quarter, led by strong sales in structural heart and complex PCI products, offset by an expected challenging quarter in drug-eluting stents. Complex PCI grew double-digits for the second quarter in a row on continued momentum from multiple new launches in 2017 and we remain on track for a strong cadence in 2018 with the WOLVERINE Cutting Balloon and our next gen rotational atherectomy system, ROTAPRO. Offsetting this growth, drug-eluting stent sales were down mid-single-digits in the quarter as declines in the U.S. and Japan due to tough comps and competitive trialing were offset by low-single-digit growth in Europe. Our structural heart programs continue to build momentum with increased capabilities and scale. The strength of WATCHMAN and ACURATE position us well to deliver $400 million in structural heart revenue in 2018. WATCHMAN had another very strong quarter and continues to build global momentum, having now surpassed the 50,000 global implants milestone. And during the quarter, positive results from the Japan SALUTE trial were presented and we remain on track to launch in Japan in the second half of 2019. In the U.S., we expect to begin enrollment in the next gen WATCHMAN FLX IDE this quarter, and we continue to invest in multiple WATCHMAN market development initiatives focused on physician training, refer education, and patient awareness. Our ACURATE TAVR valve platform continues to build momentum in Europe and hit sales of $21 million this quarter, up from $16 million in fourth quarter 2017. We completed training of our European sales and clinical teams in fourth quarter and we look forward to continued momentum as well as the launch of the next gen ACURATE neo2 with an advanced seal in Europe in the second half of this year. We're also expanding access to ACURATE in multiple markets and have begun the process for reimbursement in France, which is expected in 2020. Enrollment in the SCOPE I and SCOPE II studies is expected to be completed by the year end and we anticipate beginning enrollment in our U.S. IDE for ACURATE in the second half of the year. Regarding our LOTUS Edge TAVR valve platform, there's no change to our commentary from earlier in the year. In that pending our ability to clear certain technical and regulatory hurdles, our goal remains to launch LOTUS Edge in the U.S. and European markets in 2019. So to close, I'd like to share again my enthusiasm for outlook in 2018 and beyond. We really believe that Boston Scientific continues to be uniquely positioned to drive shareholder value due to our differentiated long-term growth profile, significant room to improve operating margins, our consistent track record of driving double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and our improving ability to deploy capital. I really want to thank again our employees for their winning spirit and commitment to advancing science for life. And Dan will now provide a detailed review of our financials. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Mike. First quarter consolidated revenue of $2,379 million represents 10.1% reported revenue growth and 6.2% growth on an operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Our reported revenue reflects an $83 million tailwind from foreign exchange, which was slightly favorable to the $60 million to $70 million tailwind expected at the time of guidance. Sales from the Symetis acquisition contributed approximately 100 basis points, which was slightly above our expectations at the time of guidance, resulting in 5.2% organic revenue growth for the quarter. This strong top-line exceeded the high end of our guidance range of 4% to 5% due to outperformance across the majority of our businesses and regions. We leveraged this strong sales performance and delivered Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $0.33, which represents 14% year-over-year growth and is above the high end of our guidance range of $0.30 to $0.32, driven by solid metrics throughout the entire P&L. Our adjusted earnings per share includes approximately $0.01 of negative FX impact in the quarter, which was in line with what we expected at the time of guidance. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 72.3%, slightly above our guidance range of 71.5% to 72%, and represents a 170 basis point improvement over the prior year. However, Q1 2017 adjusted gross margin included approximately 180 basis points of net charges associated with the voluntary recall of the LOTUS platform and the discontinuance of the FUSE business acquired from EndoChoice. Excluding this charge, first quarter 2018 adjusted gross margin was roughly in line with prior year, but importantly, Q1 of 2018's result reflects our ability to offset a negative 190 basis point year-over-year impact from foreign exchange with operational improvements, manufacturing cost reductions, as well as favorable product mix, particularly in our CRM high voltage, WATCHMAN, and Men's Health franchises. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $846 million, or 35.5% of sales in Q1 2018, down 60 basis points year-over-year and within our guidance range of 35% to 36%. We remain committed to and continue to realize the benefit of our targeted initiatives focused on reducing SG&A, like end-to-end business process streamlining and automation, expansion of global shared services, and leveraging global sourcing. Adjusted research and development expenses were $254 million in the quarter, or 10.7% of sales, which is relatively flat to Q1 of last year. Royalty expense was 0.7% of sales in Q1 this year, also roughly flat year-over-year. As a result of the strong sales and solid performance throughout the P&L, Q1 2018 adjusted operating margin of 25.3% increased 230 basis points year-over-year and slightly exceeded our guidance range of 24.75% to 25.25%. Normalizing for the one-time charges incurred in the first quarter of 2017, related to LOTUS and FUSE that I just mentioned, adjusted operating margin improved operationally by 40 basis points year over year. There's no change to our full year adjusted operating margin guidance of 25.5% to 25.75%, as we continue to deliver against our goals, and remain on track for our adjusted operating margin goal of 28% in 2020, and 30% plus longer term. The underlying year over year improvement in our Q1 2018 adjusted operating margin rate was driven by gains in all three of our segment operating results. The new Rhythm and Neuro segment delivered an operating margin of 20.8%, which, on a comparable basis, represents a 450 basis point increase over the prior year. The addition of neuromodulation to what was the Rhythm Management standalone segment to create Rhythm and Neuro does not materially change the current profile or future outlook for these businesses. The teams continue to leverage strong top line results in all three businesses and make strong progress on gross margin through favorable S-ICD and Resonate portfolio product mix in CRM, focus plant network optimization, as well as manufacturing efficiencies. In addition, we are seeing results from the strong focus on expense controls and leveraging ongoing commercial synergies. The addition of Neuromodulation is slightly dilutive now to the segment, but over the next couple of years, margins are expected to be similar to where Rhythm Management margins were. And as a result, the prior goal of increasing Rhythm Management operating margin by 300 to 400 basis points by 2020 is still a reasonable goal for this combined segment. The MedSurg segment, now comprised Endoscopy and Urology/Pelvic Health also realized significant year over year operating margin improvements of 290 basis points in the quarter, delivering 36.4% on a comparable basis. Even as we made investments in commercial capabilities for ongoing launches across both businesses, these were more than offset by leverage from strong topline performance and cost containment initiatives. In the Cardiovascular segment, operating margin increased 380 basis points year over year, but when you consider the LOTUS charges in Q1 last year, it's actually down slightly, primarily due to the investment in our structural heart franchise. Now I'll move below the line to interest and other expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $61 million, compared to $57 million in Q1 of last year. Our average interest expense rate was 4.1% in Q1 this year, slightly higher than the 4.0% in Q1 of last year, as a result of our recent public offering of $1 billion aggregate principal amount, 4% senior notes due March 1, 2028. With the proceeds of this offering in the quarter, we repaid certain short-term commercial paper balances and $600 million of 2.65% notes that were coming due in October of 2018. Adjusted other expense was $18 million in the first quarter, and primarily included dilution from our equity method investment, adjustments to our available for sale investments, as well as foreign exchange losses related to our hedging program. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 8% on a reported basis and 13.2% on an adjusted basis, which was at the low end of our guidance range of 13% to 14%. As expected, our underlying operational tax rate was approximately 16%, and we realized a net benefit from stock compensation accounting of approximately 260 basis points in the quarter and still expect the full year benefit from stock comp to be approximately 100 basis points. Finally, Q1 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $0.33 includes approximately $0.01 of unfavorable FX and represents 14% year over year growth, or 19% growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, which includes net charges and amortization expenses totaling $157 million after tax, Q1 2018 earnings per share was $0.21. We ended with 1,397 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $283 million, compared to $167 million in Q1 2017. In the quarter, we used cash primarily to fund previously agreed upon legal settlements, as well as business development activities, namely the investment in Millipede. We continue to expect 2018 adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $1.9 billion. We continue to make good progress on our mesh litigation and still expect to make cash payments of approximately $800 million to fund the settlement of the remaining legal reserves related to the mesh litigation. We have now reached conditional, final or near final settlement on approximately 95% of all known claims, as we continue to reduce the risk on our balance sheet and target a resolution of the majority of our mesh claims in 2018. Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $1,511 million as of March 31, 2018. As a reminder, this liability is released from our balance sheet as payments are made out of the qualified settlement fund, into which we've already made payments in prior quarters. In addition, finalizing the IRS stipulation of settled issues for the 2001 to 2010 tax years remains on track, and we currently believe that it will be finalized during Q2, 2018. We still expect to make net cash payments of approximately $600 million around mid-year, and we will also adjust our balance sheet to reflect the final settlement in the quarter in which that occurs. If our timeline holds, we would expect to record a tax benefit in Q2, for both GAAP and adjusted earnings consistent with the manner in which the tax reserves were originally booked. However, to the extent that we have a tax benefit for adjusted earnings, we are exploring strategies to reinvest that tax benefit into our tax structure, with the goal of reducing our overall operational tax rate in 2019 and beyond, below our previously announced goal of 15%. As a result, we do not expect that any tax benefit resulting from finalizing the IRS settlement will cause a modification to our full year adjusted EPS guidance. This $800 million estimated payment for mesh settlements combined with our expected $600 million payment as a result of finalizing our disputes with the Internal Revenue Service requires approximately $1.4 billion of cash flow for the year to settle our remaining significant existing contingencies. Capital expenditures for the first quarter 2018 were $60 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $325 million for the year, as we build capacity, integrate acquisitions and drive growth. I'll now walk through guidance for Q2 and full year 2018. For the full year we expect consolidated 2018 revenue to be in the range of $9,750 million to $9,900 million, which represents year over year growth of 5% to 7% on an organic basis, with an additional 40 basis point contribution from the Symetis acquisition. We expect foreign exchange to be a tailwind of approximately $200 million to $225 million for the full year 2018. We continue to expect our adjusted gross margin for the year as a percentage of sales to be approximately 72% for the full year, which now assumes a negative FX impact of 120 basis points or 10 basis points greater than prior guidance. We have also considered the recent proposed tariffs between the U.S. and China in our adjusted gross margin guidance. We do not manufacture in China, but we do purchase a small percentage of component inventory from China, so there may be slight pressure on our cost of goods sold, if U.S. tariffs are applied to Chinese manufactured goods. However, we also may have the ability to substitute some of those products and we expect we can manage the impact. For goods imported to China, it appears there will not be an impact from the China 301 list because there are no devices currently on that list. We will continue to monitor developments, but as of today, we do not expect a significant impact to our business. We continue to expect full year adjusted SG&A to be in the range of 34.5% to 35% of sales as we're seeing the benefits of operating expense control programs currently underway and there's also no change to expectations for full year adjusted R&D spend in a range of 10% to 11% and full year royalty rate to remain at slightly less than 1% of sales for 2018. This implies a full year 2018 adjusted operating margin in a range of 25.5% to 25.75%, which remains consistent with the improvement goals we outlined at an investor conference on January 9 and sets us up well to deliver on our long-term goal of 28% adjusted operating margin in 2020. We continue to expect our 2018 operational tax rate to be between 14% and 15% and our adjusted rate to reflect an additional approximately 100 basis points of benefit from the accounting standard for stock compensation, of which the majority was recognized in our Q1 tax rate. We expect below the line expenses, which include interest payments, dilution from our venture capital portfolio, and costs associated with our hedging program to be approximately $300 million for the year and a fully-diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,398 million shares for Q2 and 1,401 million shares for full year 2018. As a result of the improved revenue growth outlook and Q1 outperformance, we are raising full year 2018 adjusted earnings per share from a range of $1.35 to $1.39 now to a range of $1.37 to $1.41, representing 9% to 12% adjusted earnings growth. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.90 to $0.94. Now turning to Q2 2018, we expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $2,450 million to $2,500 million. This represents year-over-year organic growth in a range of 5% to 7% with an additional 70 basis point operational growth contribution from Symetis, which we will anniversary at the end of May. We expect the foreign exchange impact on Q2 revenue will be a $60 million to $70 million tailwind. For the second quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.33 to $0.35 per share, representing 3% to 10% growth, and GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.21 to $0.23 per share. Please check Our Investor Relations website for Q1 2018 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q1 results as well as Q2 and full-year 2018 guidance, including P&L line item guidance. So, with that I'll turn it back to Susie who will moderate the Q&A. Susan Vissers Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Dan. Greg, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Greg, please go ahead. Operator : Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Maybe one for Dan on guidance and then maybe one for Mike on some segments. Dan, just beyond the quarter it does look like getting back to 6% organic growth across the next several quarters does look, frankly, very achievable by our model. So, how do you see the rest of the year playing out across the quarters? And what could drive the low end of the 5% to 7% guidance for the second quarter as the comps get easier? And then a quick follow-up for Mike. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah, I would say the momentum coming out of the first quarter is solid, as we said, across the majority of the businesses and regions, which is the biggest reason that led us to take the increase up to 5% to 7% for the second quarter and 5% to 7% for the year. So we're very comfortable with that range as we look at the quarter and the full year. As Mike outlined, some of the areas that we see pressure in DES and in pacer, those are probably some of the things that could put you towards that low end of the range, if those didn't go our way, but that's not what we're anticipating based on the ranges that we have and the momentum that we have in the global diversified business that is Boston Scientific. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Very clear. And, Mike, if there are two segments that stuck out to us this quarter from a momentum perspective, they obviously were Neuro, which is very good, and IC, which is a little less so. But you gave some great detail on Neuro, so I guess I'll focus on Interventional Cardiology. If there was one area of apprehension to the year, it was obviously in IC. So can you discuss the pressures you're seeing in stents, if any? And then relative to ACURATE, that's the other kind of tale of a different city. ACURATE's sequential performance was very strong and the guidance implies, I think, another meaningful step up, frankly, into the second quarter. So if you could talk about what you're seeing in stents and what you think is driving this pretty rapid change in momentum for ACURATE. Thanks so much. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. So overall, I would say we're quite pleased with our first quarter IC performance. It was really in line with what we expected. Just a couple broader points. Kevin and the team continue to rapidly diversify that business globally. Our complex coronary business will likely be equal to the size of our DES business, probably end of 2019, and then you have a rapid growing structural heart business on top of that. So, that business continues to diversify significantly beyond DES over the years here. You know, within DES itself, continues to be a key cash driver for the company to enable us to invest in structural heart and other initiatives. I think the good news there is you're seeing growth in Europe. So, after all the trialing of lots of competitive different offerings, you've seen low-single-digit growth in Europe. We anticipated softness in the U.S. in first quarter and through the full year due to some tougher comps in DES, but also competitive trialing, but we like our long-term prospects in DES of new products coming plus the growth over in Europe. I think the stars that are getting larger and larger, which continue to kind of reshape the composite mix of IC, are complex coronary and structural heart. WATCHMAN continues to do extremely well. We're on track to deliver the $400 million of structural heart guidance. The utilization of WATCHMAN continues to increase, and we also are enrolling in our next gen WATCHMAN device in Europe and we'll start that in the second quarter here in the U.S. ACURATE, really pleased with that. Sometimes you do acquisitions and this integration's been like five stars across the board. Our supply chain team has tripled production. We have next generation ACURATE. We'll launch in the second half with an advanced seal. We'll enroll that at the full clinical trial, SCOPE I and SCOPE II. And we'll launch the U.S. IDE shortly here. So that team really is delivering. And that's against in some markets where we're not approved yet. We're not approved for reimbursement yet in France. So, we're very bullish on ACURATE and WATCHMAN, complex coronary and we feel like we'll manage the near-term headwinds in DES. And if Europe's an indicator, that will get back to growth. But that's all been contemplated in the guidance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Oh, thanks and good morning and congrats on a great start to the year. I wanted to start with a product question, if okay. Because one thing that stuck out to me was on the defibrillator, or ICD side, very impressive results despite a tough comp. So I guess my question on the ICD side is, is the market getting better at all? Or is this all your replacement cycle kicking in and that share gains from things like HeartLogic and just the new platforms? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: I think the market's been pretty consistent over the past probably one or two years. I think we just have very strong portfolio in defib. The product that gets the least amount of attention that continues to grow double-digit is S-ICD. So that platform has become quite significant in terms of dollar revenue and is growing strongly in all major markets : U.S., Europe, and Asia-Pac. And we have some additional enhancements to further simplify that product coming and some additional clinical data. So, that's ICD. For some reason, it floats a bit under the radar. But that's a terrific driver for us, as well as a mix driver. And then Resonate, the new platform there, that was years in the development, probably seven years of development with our HeartLogic diagnostic tool. And that's providing very unique competitive differentiation. So, that and then the replacement cycle, we talked about that contributing maybe a point of growth and that's in line. So, I think it's very strong portfolio and execution by our global CRM team. Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you for that. That's very helpful. One other thing I wanted to ask about, obviously one of the things that happened over the course of the last three to four months is that you guys have executed on a number of smaller but important transactions. So, I just wanted to ask, relating to those three or four deals, just when do you think we could start to see real revenue contribution from those deals? Is that 2020 or will it take a little longer? And then from a financial perspective, how do these deals impact the margin goals that you guys have laid out? In other words, how much dilution are you offsetting? So, just on the deals, when is the revenue growth contribution coming? And just maybe talk about the impact of those deals on margins. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. So, Dan can touch on the margins. So, these are five deals, two that are more to further strengthen our core. And these two are quite small; the EmCision deal in Endo and Securus and you'll see a little bit of revenue from those. You'll see revenue from those, I should say, in 2019. And then three maybe more strategic and larger opportunities are all in either adjacent markets that are high growth, or new white space. And Millipede, clearly a larger investment where we have the option to acquire that. Both parties do, actually. That would be a longer-term play, given the mitral repair market and the clinical requirements there. So you're not going to see any revenue in 2019 and 2020 from Millipede. But NxThera and nVision, two really exciting opportunities in, call it either adjacent markets or white space. You'll see some revenue with NxThera in 2018, and we expect some strong momentum out of NxThera in 2019, and similarly in nVision. There will be a little bit of revenue in 2018 and stronger contribution in 2019. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: And in terms of the margin, Bob, simply put, all of that's contemplated in the 25.5% to 25.75% for the year and also, the 28% in 2020. To the extent that we do a deal that has any dilution in it, we make the appropriate tradeoffs to still deliver on the commitments and then obviously everything becomes accretive in the longer term. So, all contemplated within our goals that we establish. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, good morning, guys. Mike, can you give us a little bit more color on WATCHMAN? And the reason I'm asking is ACURATE is doing very well. But you didn't change your $400 million structural heart guidance. So I just want to make sure that you're pleased with WATCHMAN here in the first quarter, given no change to the $400 million guide. And then as my second question, can you just remind us of the trial design for ACURATE in the U.S. IDE trial? Thanks. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. Couldn't be more pleased with the progress that WATCHMAN's making globally. We didn't take our number up. We do think there potentially could be some upside. So we'll see what happens later in the year with that number. But it's doing extremely well. The bulk of the growth is in the U.S., but we're also expanding into China. And we're also excited about the clinical trial completion in Japan, which will be a very big market that will launch in the second half of next year. So for us, what's the most important metric is utilization rate. So we open up new centers, but the new center openings slow down over time given the presence that we already have. So it's really about the safety profile, great outcomes, and utilization. And we continue to see an increase in utilization rates across our base of existing centers. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then just some color on the U.S. trial for ACURATE, which I believe is going to start sometime in the second half. Ian T. Meredith - Boston Scientific Corp.: Hi, Glenn, it's Ian Meredith. Thank you for the question. So the U.S. ACURATE IDE trial will be a randomized trial of extreme high and immediate risk patients. Approximately 500 patients. And it will be a comparison against any commercially available valve, which will be either the Edwards SAPIEN 3 valve or indeed the Medtronic Evolut R or PRO platforms. So 500 patients, randomized to either of those two, and we will leverage the SCOPE 1 and SCOPE 2 data sets to put together a larger package as a consequence of that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell from SunTrust. Please go ahead. Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Mike, very nice quarter and I've really been impressed by the balance of the company. One of the things that was really exciting to me at the investor conference was the opportunity you're exploring in endoluminal surgery. BSX made an investment this quarter and I was wondering whether you or Ian could comment on that particular technology that you purchased and the likely trajectory, the broader opportunity. And I have a follow-up up on TAVR. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Great. Thank you. So I think this is very consistent across all of our businesses is growing our core markets, our traditional ones in biliary and others, for example, in hemostasis and Endo, but then branching off into faster growth and new innovative markets. And the acquisitions that we tick through really support that in new adjacencies and new white space, so we can deliver significantly above peer growth for the long term. Specifically to endoscopy, endoluminal surgery is a investment that we've been making for multiple years under Dave Pierce's leadership and now Art Butcher. We see a large opportunity to, over time, move more general surgery procedures over to less invasive interventional approaches. The team, for lack of a better word, has pulled together a toolkit of internal organic R&D efforts as well as maybe two or three small tuck-in deals to do that. And so, this Orise product allows us to get after esophageal cancer and other cancer interventional techniques to hopefully avoid general surgery. And so, we think we're leading the way in terms of physician training in Japan. That's actually quite a bit more mature in this market and we'll do a lot of physician training in the U.S. I think over time here our goal is just to slowly help convert more general surgery procedures to less invasive interventional techniques. And we're pulling together the capabilities and the training to do that. So that'll continue to be another branch of growth for Endo beyond our pathology and infection prevention which are also recent new markets that they've moved into. Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. And my question with regard to TAVR is we were struck by Edwards' commentary regarding the step down and the ex-U.S. market growth from lower 20s in the fourth quarter to low teens this quarter with a broader backdrop of price sensitivity in Europe. We realize there can be dramatic quarter-to-quarter variation, both the U.S. and ex-U.S. market growth for no real fundamental reason. But we just wanted to check with you or Ian as to whether you perceive the secular shift in ex-U.S. payer perspective as to their willingness to pay for TAVR amongst largely an elderly population, which is historically not treated, or to convert surgery, which tends to be cheaper ex-U.S., to TAVR. Any change that you've really seen or is this just one of those quarters? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: I'll make that first comment maybe on just the market and then Ian can make some other comments. Clearly, we see more price sensitivity in Europe than we do in the U.S. There's more competitors in Europe than there are in the U.S. And we see more price variation by country. We're really on offense here. We're launching into new markets. We haven't been approved or reimbursed in some markets yet. So this is all new growth for us. And we have a terrific platform with ACURATE, with the next gen seal coming at very nice gross margin rate. And then we're optimistic on the progress with LOTUS as well. But Ian, do you have any other comments? Ian T. Meredith - Boston Scientific Corp.: No. I'd only add, Bruce, that I don't think that there's really any evidence that there's a slowing of the uptake of transcatheter aortic valve for severe aortic stenosis in the elderly patients. I think the evidence is growing stronger all the time and there's widespread understanding of the value of this technology in reducing morbidity and mortality. So I see no reason to think that this would slow. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So one on EP, one on TAVR. Let me start with EP for Dr. Stein. So, next month at HRS, Dr. Stein, we're going to see the long awaited CABANA trial results. What are your thoughts on that? Do you think that if it misses the primary endpoint, it could hurt the afib ablation market? And if it makes the primary endpoint, do you think this market could even grow faster? Just any thoughts on that study, given its importance. And I had one follow-up on TAVR. Thanks Kenneth Stein, M.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah, Larry, I think we're all holding our breath to see what CABANA shows when it's released as a late breaker at HRS. I think it's always tough to speculate ahead of the data. My feel on the trial, it took so long for them to enroll and used such a variety of different technologies for mapping and for ablation, that my own view is if it turns out to be positive, I think it would be an accelerator for the market. I think if it's negative, it depends on how it's negative. But if it's a neutral result, just given the age of the trial and the early generation of technologies and variety of different approaches that were used, I don't think it would have too much of an impact. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : That's helpful. And then on \u2013 let me just ask on LOTUS. Mike, I did hear your comment a minute ago that you're optimistic on the progress of LOTUS, but my question is really around once you resolve, if you resolve the technical issues, you've stated that there are regulatory steps that you need to take. So, the question is really if you resolve the technical issues, what steps do you need to take to launch LOTUS in the U.S. and Europe? I think last year at TCT you indicated that you planned to conduct additional implants on Edge, I think before launching. Is that still the case? And I just want to throw it out there. In Europe, it seems you do have the upper hand on Edwards right now in the litigation. So, I know it's sensitive to comment on litigation, but what's stopping from you enjoining them there to kind of force a global settlement? Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. On LOTUS, there really is no change there. It's our intention and our goal is to bring LOTUS back to market in Europe and the U.S. in 2019. We made the commitment that we wouldn't comment on that until we passed the technical and testing hurdles that we require of ourselves internally. So, we'll keep you posted on that. And really, I wouldn't comment any further on clinical requirements in Europe or U.S. until we get through the quality and testing that needs to be done. On Edwards litigation, really no further comments there. We're pleased with the really strong outcomes that we've seen in Europe on the litigation front. But I wouldn't comment any further. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy from Leerink. Please go ahead. Danielle, your line is open. Please check your mute button. Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Oh. Hello. Good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Our pleasure, Danielle. Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Can you hear me okay? Sorry about that. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yes, we can hear you fine. Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks so much. I just had a question on \u2013 can you give a little bit more color about the combination of the CRM and Neuromod businesses and what this can ultimately do? I know you said Neuromod was dilutive to the operating margins. But does this make you feel incrementally better about improving margins in the CRM business as well? And what is the new sort of bar set for that business from an operating margin perspective? Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah, Danielle, this is Dan. I had a little bit of this in the prepared remarks around the overall goal. So what we used to talk about was kind of a 23% for the old Rhythm Management segment, and that's kind of still \u2013 23% plus is still where we would see the Rhythm and Neuro segment going. It was a little over 20% here in Q1. So there are some good synergies and advantages to bringing the active implantables together, as Mike had mentioned, to bring the Rhythm and Neuro segments together. But at the margin level, I think we're on track for where we said this year and on track for the 28% for 2020. Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. And then just a quick follow-up question. I mean obviously in 2019, you'll be entering that year with a lot more flexibility on the balance sheet and I was just wondering if you could give any color at a high level on how you're thinking about potentially deploying that capital going forward. Thanks so much. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah, it definitely is an inflection point for us. We'll have much better ability to deploy our capital than we would have over the last really five, six, seven years as we get into 2019 and 2020. But I don't think we change the playbook at that point. It's still about category leadership. It's still about being as deep in each of the verticals that we have and supporting that. You've seen an example of that, as Mike ticked through the deals we have done here and either closed or announced in Q1. And just because there's more cash available, relative to 2019 and 2020, I think the strategy remains the same. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen. Please go ahead. Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Let's start on TAVR and just follow up, Mike, on your territories where you have not received reimbursement. To start, I was hoping to just hear any type of cadence you can help us with. You mentioned France I think in 2020. What are the other key regions where you're seeking reimbursement approval? And then maybe [Technical Difficulty] (53:41) that. And then also just with the Symetis sequential improvement, can you just help us understand where you're having the greatest success? Is that with going deeper into historic LOTUS accounts or is it a combination of that and new customer capture? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. I'll comment on the first one. There's really not much to say. On the first one, there's really not much to comment on other than the France reimbursement comment I made in 2020. Really in Europe, beyond the French reimbursement, it's been a matter of us scaling up production, which we continue to do successfully, training our clinical team and commercial team on ACURATE. And we continue to make a lot of progress there and build momentum. And we're confident we'll continue to see strong growth out of ACURATE. But we'll be selling into most major markets in Europe, with the exception of France, without reimbursement. And then we'll be hopefully enrolling, as part of the U.S. trial, Japan as well, in the future for ACURATE. So that's probably the only comment I can make on it. We just continue to invest in the platform on the portfolio side, on the clinical capabilities. And we are seeing growth, not only in existing customers who are using it more often, but also in new customer accounts as well. We've had particular success in the UK and the Nordics and we're continuing to build up our capabilities in Germany. Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks for that. And then just a question for Dan on the margin guidance. Stronger than expected performance in Q1, increase in the top line guide. I know you laid some of this out already in your prepared remarks, but I was hoping it might be helpful to help us walk through I think it's why you can't see even stronger [Technical Difficulty] (55:35) 2018 guidance range. Thanks for taking the questions. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah, Josh, you were breaking up a little bit at the end, but I think it's on 2018 guidance and why can't it be a little bit higher. At the 25.5% to 25.75%, feel like that's appropriate guidance. Gross margin was a little hot in Q1 at 72.3%. You'll see from the guide we have that at a 71.75% for Q2. There's a little bit more sequential pressure relative to FX on gross margin. So we still think 72% is the right number there. So there's not, I don't think, a ton of upside on that front. We did give the EPS upside from the additional sales for the year of raising the range up to 7%. There's a piece of that in the EPS guide up to $1.37 to $1.41. So, feel like the 25.5% to 25.75% at this point in the year is an appropriate guide, given the top line raise and the bottom line raise. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel. Please go ahead. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Maybe I'll focus on some CRM questions at this point. Mike, you highlighted S-ICD as maybe being underappreciated. And yeah, we're four or five years in, you're still growing solid double-digits, the evolution of technology, more favorable guidelines. How sustainable is this kind of growth? What's next? Maybe just update us on your thoughts about \u2013 some of the early days the thought was S-ICDs would only be useful in maybe 10%, 15% of patients. Do you see it as a larger opportunity? And is it pulling through ICD business? Is that helping that part of the business as well, just that double offering? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: I can answer, but Dr. Stein's probably more qualified to answer. Kenneth Stein, M.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks a lot, Mike. I'm not sure about that. Yeah, Rick. I think the biggest opportunity for continued growth with S-ICD is continuing to penetrate into the traditional primary prevention market for single-chambered defibrillators. And again, you're right. The primary prevention market is the single largest market for ICDs in the U.S. and globally. And there are a number of upcoming data releases that are going to help us push that forward, as well as product releases. And so I'd highlight for everyone a late-breaking trial that's going to be presented at HRS in Boston that shows the impact of the new detection algorithm we have in a device on inappropriate shock rates. Then we're going to have eventually the release of the PRAETORIAN head-to-head trial of S-ICD versus transvenous ICD, as well as the results of our UNTOUCHED trial, specifically in primary prevention patients. And then beginning in 2019, we'll be starting clinical trials of our modular CRM offering; leadless pacemaker that's capable to communicate with the S-ICD, that in our view reduces a lot of the barriers among physicians who haven't yet adopted the device for primary prevention. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. It's great. And then just last for me on defibrillated, given again, the strong ICDs, great products, S-ICD, I'm not sure I fully understand why brady was weak and why it remains weak for the rest of the year. I know you had a tough comp in the first quarter. What are you doing, Mike, to make it better and do we have to wait until 2019 for better results there? Thanks. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. So on brady, it's been in line with what we expected. We do have some tough comps. We had very tough comps in the first quarter. We had tough comps again second quarter and they get a bit easier in the second half of the year. So, there's a lot of efforts there. We have a couple product gaps that we're trying to fill on CRTP with MRI. That's in process that we're confident we'll move forward with. We are seeing a little bit of impact on leadless pacemaking in some markets. So there's a few product gaps that we're working to fill and some difficult comps. But we really feel like when we give guidance, we give guidance to execute upon it. We've had a really good track record on that. And a bit softer pacemaker result is anticipated in that guidance and well offset by the defib performance. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Susan Vissers Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: Okay. With that, we'd like to conclude the call. Thanks very much for joining us today and we appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific.

Welcome to the Boston Scientific Q2 2018 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Susan Lisa. Please go ahead. Susan Vissers Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q2 2018 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights of Q2 2018. Dan will review the financials for the quarter and then Q3 2018 and full-year 2018 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith and Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, organic revenue growth is defined as year-over-year growth excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and sales from the acquisition of Symetis, with no prior-period related net sales. Also of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate, and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth in market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings, and other Q3 and full-year 2018 guidance, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend, and other expenses. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thank you, Susie, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong second quarter, as we continued to deliver on our commitments while further investing in our bright future. Boston Scientific's diversified portfolio and category leadership strategy continued to drive top-tier performance while also enabling us to continue to invest meaningfully in our future pipeline, both internally and via tuck-in M&A. In Q2, our team delivered 9% operational and 8% organic revenue growth, with excellent balance across our businesses as well as our geographic regions. Both MedSurg and Rhythm and Neuro grew 9% and Cardiovascular sales increased 6%, all on an organic basis. Similarly, Asia-Pac organic sales were up 9%, U.S. up 8%, Europe-Middle East-Africa 7%, and Latin America up 15%. Overall, emerging market sales grew 21%, led by excellent growth in China. We leveraged this worldwide 8% Q2 organic revenue growth to deliver adjusted EPS of $0.41, which includes a $0.06 tax benefit. Absent this benefit, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.35, representing 9% year-over-year growth and at the high end of our guidance range. And Dan will also provide more details on the tax benefit. Boston Scientific also continues to generate excellent cash flow with $558 million in adjusted free cash flow this quarter, representing a 37% year-over-year increase. We're excited about the second half of 2018 and beyond given our efforts to drive compelling and durable long-term growth with differentiated financial performance. As a result of our strong performance and confidence in our outlook, we're bringing up the low end of our full-year 2018 organic revenue growth guidance from our prior range of 5% to 7% to 6% to 7%. We're also raising our Structural Heart revenue guidance from $400 million to $450 million and guiding to Q3 2018 organic revenue growth of 7% to 8%. There's no change to our full-year 2018 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.37 to $1.41, as we are offsetting $0.03 to $0.04 of headwind from a greater than expected FX hit and dilution from recent M&A. I'll now provide some highlights on Q2 results and thoughts on our full-year 2018 outlook. In my remarks, I'll reference the growth on an organic year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified. The 9% Q2 growth in Endoscopy was a nice acceleration from the 6% growth rate in the first quarter, due to great results in our global Endo business. Q2 results were led by compelling EndoChoice performance, particularly in pathology and infection prevention, as well sales of our SpyGlass DS visualization platform, Axios stent, and the Resolution 360 platform. In addition, we're excited about the development of our Therapeutic Imaging platform, as outlined at DDW [Digestive Disease Week] in June. We anticipate this will be a great catalyst that will enable us to double our served endoscopy market to $7 billion globally by 2021. This portfolio of single-use scopes will develop over the coming years and include : the Exalt-D duodenoscope, which is a bronchoscope for use in pulmonary applications; an upper GI scope for emergent bleeds; and a surgical scope for pancreatic biliary applications. This platform will enable physicians to perform procedures more efficiently with better outcomes while improving hospital scope readiness and alleviating cross-contamination risk. We're also very encouraged by physician support and enthusiasm at DDW in June and look forward to launching a single-use scope platform, starting with Exalt-D, by year-end 2019. Our Urology and Pelvic Health business also continued its strong global performance trend, growing sales 9% in the second quarter, led by double-digit growth in our Stone franchise, where sales of LithoVue, which is our single-use digital ureteroscope, continued to outperform and drive portfolio pull-through. Sales of Men's Health products grew high single digits while our prostate health business grew mid-teens, with the Rez\u016bm minimally invasive therapy for BPH being a key driver. The advantage of Rez\u016bm that resonates most strongly with customers are the simple in-office procedure, different change of relief from symptoms, and durability of results, which limits the need for reintervention. Recent AUA [American Urology Association] guidelines supporting MIT [Minimally Invasive Therapy] approaches for BPH are also helping driver Rez\u016bm adoption. Neuromodulation grew an impressive 31% organically in Q2, driven primarily by the successful launch of our innovative WaveWriter spinal cord stimulation platform in the U.S. and increasing demand for WaveWriter in Europe. In the pain segment, WaveWriter SCS is enjoying excellent uptake due to impressive real-world results, particularly in low back pain patients, where the unique ability to offer combination waveform therapies, both with paresthesia and sub-perception, can improve therapy longevity for patients who have been on therapy for many years. Given this difficult to treat condition, we believe these excellent real-world outcomes with WaveWriter and the significant positive impact upon a patient's ability to function and quality of life are resonating with the physician and patient community and are resulting in both share capture and increased usage at existing accounts. We also continue to defend our intellectual property vigorously and are pleased with the judge's ruling yesterday in the litigation filed by Nevro in California. The judge ruled in our favor on every claim asserted by Nevro, finding that our products do not infringe any valid claims. Our Deep Brain Stimulation performance capabilities also continue to expand, with strong results in Europe and positive early momentum for the Vercise launch in the U.S. We anticipate continued strength in Neuromodulation sales in the second half of 2018. CRM sales grew above market 1%, led by high single-digit growth in defibrillator sales, reflecting an encouraging global launch of our Resonate platform and its HeartLogic heart failure alert as well as EMBLEM S-ICD. The projected benefit from our device replacement cycle is also tracking to expectations. We continue to gain share as the number two share player in the high-voltage market. And customer interest in HeartLogic continues to increase, as heart failure practitioners recognize the value of the only FDA-approved heart failure alert over 30 days in advance of an event, which importantly does not require maintenance via data monitoring. We also continue to enroll patients in the first phase of Manage AF (sic) [Manage HF], which is a multi-center randomized trial designed to quantify the benefit of proactive heart failure management by using HeartLogic. The highly differentiated EMBLEM S-ICD continues its trajectory, due in part to the growing body of clinical evidence due to the late-breaker SMART Pass at HRS in May, recent guideline inclusion that has enabled expanded private insurance coverage in the U.S., and multiple product enhancements that improve the ease of use and reduce implant procedure time. Brady pacing sales were down low-double digits in the second quarter, as we lost some share due to competitive launches and the need to close the final MRI product gap in CRT-P. While we expect Brady pacing sales to remain a headwind in the second half of 2018, given the strong global momentum of our defib portfolio, we are confident that worldwide in 2018, our CRM business should continue to grow above market. EP sales grew 16% in the quarter, led by good growth in our Rhythmia HDx mapping and navigation platform. We've also been very pleased with the recent European launch of our DirectSense and IntellaNav MiFi OI ablation catheters. Importantly, we're continuing to invest in our exciting and differentiated EP pipeline. The EP market remains highly attractive, with a demonstrated history of mid-teens market growth. In the coming years, we believe our EP business will be uniquely differentiated with the broadest portfolio. We expect to be the only company to offer EP for the second-generation cryo balloon platform as well as an RF single-shot balloon platform for pulmonary vein isolation treatment with the recent acquisitions of the Cryterion and Apama. These platforms will be an excellent complement to our arrhythmia mapping system and therapeutic catheter launches. Both our cryo and RF single-shot AF platforms are targeted to launch by year-end 2019 in Europe. Turning to our Cardiovascular group, our global PI business performed very strong, growing 9% in the quarter. The PI business grew very well in all segments, including peripheral arterial disease, venous, and interventional oncology. PI sales also increased across all major markets and performed particularly well in Asia. In Europe, we continue to see excellent uptake of our drug-eluting technologies, the Ranger drug-coated balloon and the Eluvia drug-coated stent (sic) [Eluvia drug-eluting stent], as well as our Jetstream atherectomy system. We're also continuing to target drug-eluting U.S. launches in the first half of 2019 for Eluvia DES and a 2020 for Ranger DCB. We really look forward to providing a comprehensive update on this portfolio at TCT in September. Our Interventional Cardiology business delivered 5% growth in the quarter and really demonstrates the ongoing and very successful diversification strategy of this business segment. In Q2, IC was led by very strong sales in Structural Heart and complex PCI products, partially offset by a challenging quarter in DES, which was as expected. Our complex PCI and PCI guidance business continues to expand globally and is now approaching the same size as our global DES business. Complex PCI grew high-single digits in the second quarter, as the number of patients requiring a complex coronary intervention continues to grow globally. We also enjoyed a successful launch in the quarter with the WOLVERINE cutting balloon and MAMBA microcatheters, as well as very strong sales in China and emerging markets. Similar to first quarter trends, drug-eluting stents were down mid-single digits this quarter and we would anticipate a similar outlook for the balance of the year. However, with new launches in complex PCI, including the ROTAPRO atherectomy platform, we plan to offset this DES softness. Our Structural Heart programs continue to build momentum, and our revised $450 million revenue guidance is a result of both the WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure device and ACURATE TAVR valve being ahead of plan. We're also very enthusiastic about a recent acquisition of Claret Medical, which will bring Sentinel to the BSE Structural Heart portfolio. Sentinel is the only cerebral embolic protection system approved in the U.S. and Europe to protect patients against the risk of stroke during TAVR procedures. We see a significant opportunity for embolic protection in TAVR both today and longer-term, including intermediate and low-risk patients, as well as other left heart and endovascular procedures like mitral valve repair and replacement, left atrial appendage closure, and pulmonary vein isolation procedures for AFib patients. There is no change to our LOTUS Edge TAVR valve commentary from earlier this year, and that pending certain technical and regulatory hurdles, our goal remains to launch LOTUS Edge in the U.S. and European markets in 2019. We continue to work towards this goal, but recall that we said our next LOTUS Edge update will be either the filing of the final technical module of the PMA is imminent or that we have chosen not to proceed with the program. Our ACURATE TAVR platform is delivering impressive cadence of growth and progress in Europe, and we're investing to expand ACURATE globally. We remain on track to deliver multiple ACURATE milestones in the second half of 2018, including the European launch of the next-generation ACURATE neo 2, which has an enhanced seal. Secondly, we'll be completing enrollment in the SCOPE 1 and SCOPE 2 clinical trials, where ACURATE is randomized to SAPIEN 3 and CoreValve. And finally, number three, we're looking forward to ACURATE beginning enrollment in our U.S. IDE study by the end of 2018. WATCHMAN also delivered excellent growth in the quarter, and WATCHMAN continues to build very strong global physician support, and particularly so in the U.S. All key metrics are trending well, including utilization and reorder rates and account openings. We began enrollment in the U.S. in the next-gen WATCHMAN FLX IDE, with a targeted EU launch in the first half of 2019. We remain on track to launch WATCHMAN in Japan in the second half of 2019. We also continue to invest on multiple WATCHMAN market development programs, including physician training, refer education, and increasing patient awareness. I'm also pleased that while we've been delivering these very strong results, we have also been actively investing to further strengthen our category leadership strategy and long-term growth profile of the company. In 2018, we've been active with tuck-in M&A, and in the quarter, we announced four tuck-in acquisitions, Claret, Cryterion, nVision, and Securus. These acquisitions all target high-growth markets, enhance our category leadership strategy, leverage existing BSC global capabilities, and further enhance our short-term and long-term growth profile. We also plan to fully absorb the near-term dilution of the combination of these multiple tuck-in transactions while also delivering on our commitment to double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our core business has very strong momentum and our pipeline has never been stronger. We believe we are uniquely positioned to drive shareholder value due to our differentiated long-term growth profile, continued ability to improve operating margins, our commitment to double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and a proven ability to deploy capital. I really want to thank our employees for their tremendous winning spirit and commitment to advancing science for life. Dan will now provide a detailed review of our financials. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Mike. Second quarter consolidated revenue of $2.490 billion represents 10.3% reported revenue growth and reflects a $37 million tailwind from foreign exchange, about half of the $60 million to $70 million tailwind expected at the time of guidance. On an operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, revenue growth was 8.6% in the quarter. Sales from the Symetis acquisition contributed approximately 70 basis points, which was in line with our guidance. As a reminder, the operational Symetis contribution represents only a partial period, two months, for which there were no prior-period related sales, and the revenue from Symetis is considered organic as of June 1 of this year. The resulting organic revenue growth of 7.9% in the second quarter exceeded the high end of our guidance range of 5% to 7%, as we continue to realize the benefits of our portfolio diversification and category leadership strategy, evidenced by the outperformance across the majority of our businesses and regions once again. We leveraged this strong performance and delivered Q2 adjusted earnings per share of $0.41, which includes an $82 million non-cash benefit related to the finalization of our IRS stipulation of settled issues in the quarter. Absent this benefit, our adjusted earnings per share would have been $0.35, representing 9% year-over-year growth and at the high end of our guidance range of $0.33 to $0.35. Earnings were driven by a strong top line and solid P&L metrics, and notably includes approximately $0.01 of negative FX impact as well as a $0.01 charge for an impairment of certain of our investments, which I'll discuss in a few minutes. Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 71.3%, slightly below our guidance range of 71.5% to 72%, and represents a decline of 150 basis points year over year, due primarily to a 160 basis point negative year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. This is slightly below the low end of guidance, primarily related to timing of manufacturing variances in the quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted gross margin will be approximately 72%, with the first half of the year being slightly below that and the second half being slightly higher due to less of an FX headwind, with Q4 expected to improve versus Q3. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $865 million, or 34.7% of sales in the quarter, down 80 basis points year over year and a good result towards the lower end of our guidance range of 34.5% to 35.5%. While also leveraging our top line growth, we remain committed to our targeted initiatives focused on reducing SG&A and continue to realize the benefit of efforts such as end-to-end business process streamlining and automation, enhanced leverage of our global sourcing teams, and the expansion of global shared services. Adjusted research and development expenses were $260 million in the second quarter, or 10.4% of sales. And royalty expense was 0.7% of sales, both roughly flat year over year. As a result of solid performance throughout the P&L on strong sales in the quarter, adjusted operating margin was 25.4% in the second quarter, within our guidance range of 25.25% to 25.75%. The 60 basis point year-over-year decrease is primarily driven by the 160 basis point negative FX impact at the gross margin line, as I discussed earlier. We continue to expect our full-year adjusted operating margin to be in a range of 25.5% to 25.75%, consistent with the goals outlined at the start of the year, and we remain committed to the long-term goal of 28% adjusted operating margin by 2020. Now, I'll move to below-the-line interest and other expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $57 million compared to $58 million in Q2 of last year. Our average interest expense rate was 3.6% in Q2 this year, slightly lower than the 3.9% in Q2 of last year, as a result of net investment hedges entered into in Q2 intended to hedge a portion of our net investments in certain of our international entities. Adjusted other expense was $29 million in the second quarter, and primarily included a $19 million impairment on certain of our investments. With a growing portfolio of over 30 companies, impairments may occur from time to time. However, we believe our venture strategy is working well, as most recently evidenced by the acquisitions of NxThera and Cryterion Medical from this portfolio. Adjusted other expense for the quarter also included dilution from our equity method investments, adjustments to our available-for-sale investments, as well as transactional foreign exchange losses, including hedging costs. Our tax rate for the second quarter was minus 60.3% on a reported basis, which included a $250 million non-cash benefit from the finalization of the IRS stipulation of settled issues in the quarter. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate was minus 3.8% and includes an $82 million benefit from that settlement. Excluding this benefit and our net benefit from stock compensation of approximately 75 basis points, our operational tax rate was approximately 12%. Our operational tax rate averaged 14% in the first half, consistent with our expectations for an operational tax rate of 14% to 15% for the full year or approximately 13% to 14% all-in adjusted tax rate net of stock comp benefit for the year. We've been working hard to reduce the contingent risk on our balance sheet over time. Our tax liability decreased to approximately $900 million as of the end of Q2, which is an almost $1 billion decrease from the Q1 ending balance. Of the $900 million remaining, approximately $500 million relates to the tax reform transition tax, which is payable over the next seven years, leaving approximately $400 million for all remaining global tax controversies. As a reminder, we are exploring strategies to reinvest the tax benefit reflected in our adjusted results into our tax structure, with the goal of reducing our operational tax rate in 2019 and beyond below our previously announced goal of 15%. We expect the majority of this reinvestment to occur in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we do not expect an impact to full-year adjusted earnings per share as a result of this Q2 tax benefit. Just to recap, Q2 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $0.41 includes an approximate $0.06 non-cash benefit related to the finalization of the IRS settlement. Excluding this $0.06, the $0.35 in adjusted EPS is particularly strong, considering it includes a combined $0.02 of drag from the investment impairment and additional unfavorable FX. Reported GAAP EPS of $0.40 includes net charges and amortization expenses after tax net of the settlement-related tax benefit of $13 million. We ended Q2 with 1.399 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $558 million compared to $407 million in Q2 of last year. In the quarter, we used cash and short-term debt to fund previously agreed upon legal and tax settlements as well as our recent acquisitions. We continue to expect 2018 adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $1.9 billion. We're also making good progress on our mesh litigation, with minimal incoming new claims and approximately 1,500 cases or claims remaining, which represents less than 5% of all of our known claims. We remain on track for our year-end 2018 goal to resolve the majority of our mesh claims. Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $1.264 billion as of June 30, 2018. As a reminder of the mechanics, we've already made payments into the qualified settlement fund, which is shown as restricted cash on our balance sheet, with a current balance of nearly $800 million. Yet, this liability is only released from our balance sheet when payments to plaintiffs are made out of the qualified settlement fund. So the way to think about it is we only have $400 million left to fund. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $73 million. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $350 million for the year, as we build capacity, integrate acquisitions, and drive growth. I'll now walk through guidance for the third quarter and full year 2018. For the full year, we expect consolidated 2018 revenue to be in the range of $9.800 billion to $9.880 billion, which represents year-over-year organic growth of 6% to 7%. And we expect the contribution from the Symetis acquisition realized in the first five months of the year to equate to 40 basis points of growth on that full year. We now expect foreign exchange to be a tailwind of approximately $125 million to $150 million for the full year, which is a decrease from our prior expectations of $200 million to $225 million tailwind due to the strengthening U.S. dollar against most major currencies. We continue to expect our adjusted gross margin for the year as a percentage of sales to be approximately 72%, which now assumes a negative FX impact of 90 basis points for the full year, down slightly from our prior guidance. There's no change to our expectations for full-year adjusted SG&A to be in the range of 34.5% to 35% of sales, as we are seeing the benefits of operating expense control programs currently underway. Similarly, there's no change to expectations for our full-year adjusted R&D spend in a range of 10% to 11%, and full-year royalty rates to remain at slightly less than 1% of sales for the year. This continues to imply a full-year 2018 adjusted operating margin in a range of 25.5% to 25.75%. We also continue to expect our full-year 2018 operational tax rate to be between 14% and 15% and our all-in adjusted tax rate to be 13% to 14%, which reflects an approximate 100 basis points of benefit from the accounting standard for stock compensation, of which the majority was already reflected in our first half 2018 tax rate. Consistent with prior guidance, we expect below-the-line expenses, which include interest payments, dilution from our venture capital portfolio, and cost associating with our hedging program, to be approximately $300 million for the year and a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.4 billion for Q3 and the full year 2018. We are reiterating our full-year 2018 adjusted earnings per share range of $1.37 to $1.41, representing 9% to 12% adjusted earnings growth. This now includes a negative FX impact of $0.03 to $0.04, or an increase of $0.01. In addition, as Mike mentioned, we're maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance despite the dilution expected from product and market development activities required for the acquisitions we've completed or expect to complete in 2018. By investing in our core business through these acquisitions, we believe we can enhance our outlook for durable revenue growth, all while still delivering on our double-digit EPS growth goals. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.99 to $1.03. Now, turning to Q3 2018, we expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $2.380 million to $2.420 billion, representing year-over-year organic growth of 7% to 8%. In the third quarter, we expect the foreign exchange impact to be relatively immaterial, with an expected tailwind of zero to $10 million. For the third quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to in a range of $0.33 to $0.35 per share, representing 8% to 13% growth. And GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.21 to $0.23 per share. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q2 2018 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q2 results as well as Q3 and full-year 2018 guidance, including P&L line item guidance. So with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A. Susan Vissers Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Dan. Kevin, let's open it up for questions for the next 30 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up, Kevin, please go ahead. Operator : Thank you. The first question is from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning and congrats on a good quarter. Just two questions for me, and I'll ask them all at once. The first, Mike, is more strategic for you and then a quick follow-up for Dan. But on broader M&A, Mike, I think most investors would have expected as your capital flexibility improves that M&A builds back half this year, more acutely in 2019, but we've actually kind of seen the opposite. You've been very active on M&A in the first half of the year, and I wanted you to share with us why you're so active in the first half of the year and what this now says in terms of increased activity into 2019. And then related is does the Claret strategy make sense if you're not going to be in the U.S. market with a TAVR valve for a couple of years. And that's sort of M&A. And then for Dan, just sustainability of some momentum, the two biggest businesses that broke trend this quarter, obviously, Neuromodulation and EP, kind of your confidence into the back half of the year those businesses can sustain that kind of momentum. Great quarter, thanks so much. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. Thanks, David. On the M&A front, first comment is our team has really developed excellent capabilities to execute on our integration acquisitions. If you look at the history of what we've acquired the last four or five years, the more mature companies are growing faster and driving more leverage in our hands, and we've been able to bring the newer companies along to successful completion, like ACURATE valve and so forth. Secondly, on the M&A front, this is not a new strategy for us. We've been very active in our venture fund over the past five years. We've really set the stage for these strategic acquisitions over time. So many of these acquisitions were planned and many of these we actually have an ownership stake in them. So the companies that we're tracking we're very comfortable with. And I think the third point is it really just continues to reinforce our strategy. We want to have a differentiated growth rate, differentiated financial performance, driving category leadership, and these variety of tuck-in deals all support that strategy. They leverage capabilities that we have today. They enhance our growth profile, and the discipline of the company is such that we can deliver on these acquisitions and also continue deliver operating income margin and double-digit EPS growth while importantly further enhancing our growth profile. So we have a lot of confidence in these. These are well planned, and we expect this strategy to continue. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: And then, David, relative to your second question on sustainability in Neuromod and EP growth rates from a revenue standpoint, you happened to pick on two of the highest growth markets we have. Those are both very high-growth markets, probably two of the hottest ones we have in the portfolio. If you look at EP, last four quarters, 18%, 18%, 11%, and 16%. So that's kind of at market, which is okay. We'd like to grow better than that and we have new technologies coming. You've also seen as you look at the M&A strategy, three deals in the last 12 months relative to category leadership in EP, so we're investing in that space and we want to continue to drive growth there. So if you consider that market to be mid-teens, we'd like to certainly be at that or above as we go forward. Neuromod, 31% in the quarter is a real testament to the strength of the portfolio there. With WaveWriter and with DBS launching in the U.S., hard to imagine we put up 31% every quarter but we put up 17% in the first quarter, and I think said very publicly we think that's probably the low watermark for the year. So I would like to think we're north of 20% for the foreseeable future next couple of quarters. So two good businesses with strong growth prospects that we think should continue in the near-term. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And, Mike, does Claret make sense? Just to follow back up on that, does Claret make sense if you're not going to be in the U.S. market with a TAVR valve in the next two years? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Claret makes great sense. Ian can comment, but the risk of stroke, not only in TAVR procedures, for intermediate risk, low risk, we've seen high percentages of their procedures have debris. And it's just an excellent complement to our current platform in Europe with ACURATE, and ideally would be the perfect platform for a potential combination of both LOTUS and ACURATE in the U.S., assuming we get through the much discussed technical and regulatory hurdles that we've talked about. So not only within TAVR does it make sense, but also expanded beyond TAVR and other procedures like I mentioned in mitral as well as EP procedures is a nice strategy for us. It leverages our current sales force. They have strong clinical data, and we think it's a really nice complement. Ian, do you have anything? David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks so much. Operator : All right, the next question is from the line of Glenn Novarro, RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, good morning, guys, two questions. First for Dan, the EPS guidance that you maintain of $1.37 to $1.41, does that assume \u2013 for 2Q, does that assume $0.41 or $0.35? And the reason I'm asking is if I plug $0.41 into the model and given what you've provided for 3Q and revenue guide for the full year, it looks like there will be a step-down in EPS. And if so, is the EPS step-down a function of a higher tax rate, or is that where you're seeing all the dilution coming from the recent deals? Thanks. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: So to be 100% clear, there is no step down in EPS guidance. The guidance of $1.37 to $1.41, with the way you describe it, would include a $0.35 number for the second quarter. The $0.06 of the tax benefit that gets you to $0.41, the plan is to reinvest that, largely in the fourth quarter, so you have $0.06 more in Q2. Likely you'd see the other side of that in Q4, so the $1.37 to $1.41 is still the number and still represents double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth for the year. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. So just to be clear, I should have $0.35 in the model that shows up for consensus, correct, in First Call? Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Absolutely, the $0.41 is the reported number, but the $0.06 of tax will not be a benefit for the year. It will be in in Q2 and out in Q4. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, very good, very clear. And then, Mike, I know you don't want to comment on LOTUS, but help us understand the job postings that we found recently on your website referring to the relaunch of LOTUS. Thanks. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: I would encourage you to send your resume in to HR, Glenn. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. But shouldn't that assume that you're making further progress on the catheter fix? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: We're not going to comment any further. We've said all along that our goal is to launch LOTUS in the U.S. and in Europe and getting over these hurdles, but we also have been through an up-and-down piece with this. So our commitment to our investors was that we wouldn't provide a specific date until the filing of the final technical module of the PMA is imminent or that we've chosen not to proceed. So we just basically don't want to give the blow by blow until this 100% over the goal line or not. In the meantime, the company is growing 9% operational and 8% organic, and our Structural Heart guidance we took up for the quarter. So it's our goal, but we're not going to give you a further update until it's over the goal line. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Rick Wise, Stifel. Please go ahead. Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Maybe I'll continue on the TAVR front, Mike. ACURATE, the OUS performance you described is continuing strong. Can you quantify about it at all in dollars or percent? And maybe just talk as you answer about how broadly the products are available in Europe now, the potential impact of the ACURATE neo2 in terms of reaching more patients or facilitating more procedures. And I have a follow-up. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. On ACURATE, I'm just really proud of the team. It goes back to David's question on our confidence and our ability to acquire companies and integrate them swiftly with our teams. And the team over in Europe has done a great job. We've managed the delicate balance of driving and maintaining the innovation of the company that we acquire but leveraging the global footprint that we have. And so ACURATE has exceeded our expectations. As you know, it's got an extremely low pacemaker rate, it's very easy to implant, and it continues to get wider visibility now that it has our commercial footprint. As you know, the bulk of the sales are in \u2013 call it the DOC [Denominazione di Origine Controllata] region; Germany, Austria, Switzerland, as well as the UK and the Nordics. We're not in France yet. We expect to be there I think by the end of 2019. And we're just now trying to expand ACURATE into other markets like Australia as well as Canada. So you'll see that ACURATE platform continue to \u2013 and also Latin America \u2013 continue to expand outside of the U.S. throughout the second half of this year and in 2019. And then in parallel, I'm really excited about the next-generation ACURATE neo, the combined improved PBL rate with the enhanced seal, with the best-in-class pacemaker right now, and ease of use. And then we finish up our SCOPE 1 and SCOPE 2 and hopefully initiate that U.S. IDE here in the second half. So a lot of momentum there, and combined with the potential dual-valve strategy and the complementary nature of Claret really makes a compelling TAVR portfolio for us. Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Turning to AF, Mike, you highlighted a number of milestones and targets. Maybe talk about the timing. I don't think you said it of the U.S. AF catheter launches. EU you said end of 2019, but U.S., is it 2020 or 2021? And are those launches the key inflection or a key driver that gets you to -- actually you are roughly at -- sustains you at or gets you to above-market levels of growth, or can you get there before with all the portfolio that you have? Thanks so much. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: EP has been a strategic focus for us for a while. Five years ago, we essentially didn't have much of an EP business in terms of any innovation. And over time, we really believe that we'll have the most compelling portfolio in EP as you project out over the next few years. We're the only company with a modern mapping system, full therapeutic catheter launches, including pore sensing over time. And we're the only company with two shots on goal with single-shot therapy with cryo as well as with A-fib \u2013 with RF with our Apama balloon. So we think the portfolio is uniquely differentiated, and we're doing this because this market is so large. It's growing mid-teens, and we're currently growing at market, but we don't have the scale some of our competitors do. So we think the combination of that portfolio, and we'll have the single-shot balloons in Europe in the second half of 2019 and we'll launch the IDE trials in the U.S. in the second half of 2019 as well. So we think that combination, if you look at DSC over the next three years, we'll be uniquely positioned in EP. And where we grow in EP, we also do better in CRM. So it's also important for us from that perspective. Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I appreciate it. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, and I'll reiterate the congratulations on another strong quarter. First, I also wanted to start with a product question. I think the next big data presentation for you guys is the IMPERIAL IDE with Eluvia at hopefully I think TCT in September, and I think that study is comparing Eluvia to Zilver for PTX. So my question is do you think you need to show superiority in that trial for the product to do well commercially in the United States? And I had a follow-up question. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: We'll have Dr. Meredith respond to that one. Ian T. Meredith - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Larry. I think the trial is designed on non-inferiority. And I think a lot about that question about superiority or non-inferiority, but I think that point estimate of the difference is something that physicians take home from those studies. So it's designed as a non-inferiority study, and there are obviously safety and efficacy endpoints. I think the data doesn't need to be a superiority study. It's important to look at point estimates. Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : That's helpful. And regarding yesterday's ruling between Boston Scientific and Nevro, what does it say about your freedom to operate in the U.S. with paresthesia-free 10,000-hertz spinal cord stimulation? And what are your plans to present the ACCELERATE data? I think the slides say it's going to complete in 2018, so should we expect to see that at NANS [North American Neuromodulation Society] 2019? Thanks for taking the questions. Ian T. Meredith - Boston Scientific Corp.: Larry, perhaps I could take that one. As you know, the ACCELERATE trial is the study of the PRECISION spinal cord stimulation system and now the Spectra WaveWriter system, both modified to deliver high-frequency stimulation up to 10,000 hertz. The estimated primary completion date is being pushed out now from July 2018 to March 2019, and an estimated completion date for that will be between April 2019 and November 2019. This nine-month delay ensures that we can collect sufficient data on the Spectra WaveWriter system. Now, I might add, as you know, this is a randomized trial, and the primary goal of the ACCELERATE trial is to look at the impact of frequency on pain relief, where we now know that frequency is only one element. The pulse amplitude and other factors are also very important, and you know that we have both the WHISPER and PROCO studies, which have basically demonstrated that choosing between frequencies results in better outcomes. That's the WHISPER study, and the PROCO study was within subject comparison of multiple frequencies, showing that you could in fact actually get as good pain relief with 1,000 hertz versus 10,000 hertz and using significantly less energy and battery life to do that. So I think we're changing our view on what spinal cord stimulation patterns and frequencies need to be to cover both amplitude and waveform. Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Joanne Wuensch, BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning and thanks for taking my question, very nice quarter. Two questions, I'll put them both out there. First of all, in cardiac rhythm management, it looks likes like there are some product gaps that need to be filled. And how do you think about filling those and what timing, and ultimately how do you view that business line? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. In CRM, we really are on a high degree of offense in defibrillators. We don't see any product gaps there. And we have a lot of differentiation, primarily in two areas, with our S-ICD, which continues to drive double-digit growth globally, and we have a multiyear head start on that. And we continue to drive enhancements to that to improve procedures. And Ken can comment on it in a minute. It's just on the enhanced clinical body of evidence that continues to mount on that. So that's a long-term differentiator for us. The second one is our RESONATE platform with HeartLogic is taking share there. And we want to continue to focus with it more on CRT-D with that platform. So on defib, we're really in a very strong position. On the pacemaker side, we do have some product gaps with CRT-D pacing with MRI. We hope to fill that gap within the next \u2013 I guess fourth quarter this year. So that will be -- so we expect really the second half of this year to maintain pacemaker softness, but that MRI CRT-D gap will be filled by the end of the year. So likely you'll see in 2019 some improvement in our pacemaker capabilities. The only other gap that we have in pacemaker is the leadless platform, and those efforts are underway in combining a standalone leadless pacemaker and also uniquely differentiated combining our leadless pacemaker with our S-ICD. Maybe, Ken, you want to comment on that piece of it. Kenneth Stein, M.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Mike. Again, Joanne, I think we're comfortable that it's our competitors who have gaps, particularly in the high-voltage arena. Mike mentioned S-ICD. We have the world's only ICD that does not require any leads touching the heart. And as you look to how that's evolving, I think Mike hit on something that we're very excited about, which is our EMPOWER leadless pacing system, which is going to go into IDE trials in 2019, which will include a trial designed to show that that can function as a run of the mill VVI pacemaker and close that gap, if you will, but also show that it can be capable of coordinating with and communicating with the S-ICD, creating, frankly, another product gap for our competitors and resolving what has been the residual anxiety people have had about using the S-ICD in primary prevention patients. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Excellent. And as a follow-up question, I'm going very back to the beginning of Q&A. There's a lot of M&A that you're doing a lot faster than I and many investors, I think, would have expected. If we look forward three to five years, how do you big picture view the portfolio? How do you plan for building it out from here? And are there things you don't want to have anymore? Thanks. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Oh yeah, there's lots of things we don't want to have. So we note all that. So we have a very \u2013 I'm not going to share it on the call. We have a very thoughtful laid out strategic plan that we continue to modify some of the tactics and regions and by BU. We know very clearly what spaces we want to invest in, what adjacencies we want to invest in, and what areas we don't. And so it's very well laid out. And not surprisingly, if you look at these small tuck-in deals, none of these are significant and one-size. So they're tuck-in deals that all leverage capabilities that we currently have. They enhance the diversification growth profile of the company, and importantly, probably most importantly, tremendous confidence in our team's ability to deliver on them. And we've spread them out across the BUs and we work very closely with our operations team, and we still see a pipeline of future tuck-in deals over the next 12 months. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Robbie Marcus, JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Robert J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, thanks and congrats on a good quarter. Dan, I wanted to start and follow up on the tax question. Do you mind spending a minute on where the tax upside will be reinvested in the fourth quarter? Is it all into the tax line, or is it throughout the P&L? Maybe talk about some of the mechanisms that will help lower the tax rate going forward in 2019. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure, Robbie. The short answer to that is it will all show up on the tax line, it won't show up in any other area of the P&L. And just to, again, I think probably worth recapping, so we finalized the 2001 to 2010 IRS settlement. There's an $82 million non-cash benefit to adjusted earnings in the quarter, $0.06, which is the difference between the $0.41 and the $0.35. Our current expectation is that we would reinvest substantially all of this benefit, likely in the fourth quarter. Therefore, there's no change to full-year adjusted EPS guidance. We've invested in our tax structure with the goal of reducing our tax rate 2019 and beyond. So recall our \u2013 we're on record now as saying we'll have an operational rate of 15% in 2019 and beyond. Goal would be to reinvest that in our tax structure, bring that 15% down. The way we would do that is \u2013 it's not a cash investment, so this is a non-cash benefit. And what we would do is monetize some of our existing deferred tax assets. And simply put, when you look at the world and the different tax rates around the world and where you earn your income and where you have certain presences, that's what we would evaluate is how do you do that to take that 15% and bring that down for the future. So hopefully that's clear. We'll be more disclosive as we go through Q3 and Q4 and enact those strategies. We're in the process of developing them now. But goal would be to take that $82 million benefit, reinvest it and bring down the 15% in 2019 and beyond, all on the tax line. Robert J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great, and then just a quick follow-up. Emerging market growth, strong double digits this quarter. Maybe you can just talk about how sustainable that strength is, some of the health of the emerging markets and are you seeing an impact. And then maybe just give us your latest thoughts on any impact from China tariffs and the latest on the China price decreases this year. Thanks. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. So this is a very good quarter with emerging market growth. As we laid out in our Investor Day a while ago, emerging markets will continue to be accretive to our overall growth profile. I think what you're seeing is just an increased commercial capability and portfolio enhancements, whether it be the emerging markets in Asia, Middle East-Africa, and also Eastern Europe. So all three of those regions performed well, China being the largest one. And so I think the capabilities of local team, the regulatory product approvals that we have, and also it's the diversification of the business. So in prior years, it was really a DES play only. So DES is still important for us, but it's diversifying into complex coronary capabilities. Peripheral intervention is growing extremely fast in emerging markets. We're expanding Endoscopy, Urology, and Neuromodulation. So it's the diversification of portfolio and just excellent work by the local teams. I think the other comment I'll just make broadly, maybe that we're most proud about is the diversification of the company. And five or six years ago, if you would have said DES is going to be down mid-single digits and CRM was going to be up 1%, you'd have a company at Boston probably growing flat. And we put up a 9% operational, 8% organic. And our R&D pipeline in combination with the tuck-in M&A are all reinforcing that category leadership strategy, diversification, and faster growth markets. So it's a much different company, and we're very confident in our ability to continue the momentum. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: And just to tie off specifically on your China question, Robbie, so we don't manufacture in China. We do buy a small portion of our components. It's a small, very manageable percentage of our supply costs, have some ability to substitute in some other suppliers outside of China, so don't see a big impact there. In terms of the tariffs that are there, currently we don't see any medical devices in that tariff list, so I'm not anticipating a big impact there, and really nothing new on the China tender, so kind of status quo from where we've been the last six months, which is no real updates on that. Operator : Okay, next we have Chris Pasquale, Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Christopher Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks, a quick one for Dan and then one for Dr. Meredith on Claret. Dan, can you just quantify the M&A dilution you're offsetting this year? Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah, it's a little north of $0.02, yeah. Christopher Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Great, thanks, and then... Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Just a quick comment on that. So none of them individually is that large when you see the press release is they're all overall immaterial on each one. It's just when you do that, the number we've done, and we're excited for the deals we've done it just aggregates to about $0.02. Christopher Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Perfect, thank you. And then, Dr. Meredith, on Claret, do you expect to receive a new tech add-on payment for that technology when the IPPS final rule is released in a couple of weeks? And how do you think about the potential for adoption, either with or without that economic incentive for use? And then from a pipeline perspective, what are you more focused on? Is it iterating the technology or expanding the indications for use? I know there has been some question about whether leaving the left subclavian exposed might limit the efficacy of that particular device. Ian T. Meredith - Boston Scientific Corp.: Okay, thanks very much, Chris, for the question. First of all, as you know, there is an application for the NTAP in process, and we'll hear the outcome of that by the end of August, and it will be coming to effect if we receive that in October. But we are not dependent on that nor have we modeled that as that being critical to the uptake in the utilization. More than 100 centers in the U.S. are currently using the device, and it's up to 60% of cases in those centers using device. So I think physicians have essentially voted with their feet. As you know, the last 15 trials in a pooled registry have shown the stroke rate of around 4.5% in more than 8,000 patients, and half of those are disabling strokes. So I think physicians and hospitals are voting with their feet with respect to this. And obviously, the NTAP payment would be much welcome, but it's certainly not \u2013 we're not dependent on that. And as for expanding the indications, I think the first thing to say is to consolidate where we are in the TAVR market, and then obviously the iteration of the device to cover the left vertebral artery. Now does that really matter? Probably not significantly so, it accounts for less than 10%, probably 5% of the flow. The other vessels are more relevant. And of course, seeing that you've mentioned thereafter the indications for other uses, the mitral, left atrial appendage occlusion, and then high-risk PVI for AF ablation, because all of those procedures are associated with somewhere between 0.5% and 1.5% risk of stroke and a 20% to 40% occurrence of asymptomatic cerebral ischemic injuries on MR or other forms of neuroimaging. So I think that's the way it rolls out. Susan Vissers Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: Kevin, we'll take one more, please. Operator : And that question is from the line of Bruce Nudell, SunTrust Robinson. Please go ahead. Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you for squeezing me in. I just have two questions. One clinical, one M&A-related. So on the clinical side, just to put a finer point on it, the result, Nevro put out a press release this morning saying they're still protected above 1.5 kilohertz. Without the debating the veracity of the statement, just given the day got to date showing of Nevro's response between 1 and 10 kilohertz, the improved battery efficiency, and the importance of waveform optionality, do you actually \u2013 is there any evidence that you really are going to have to go above 1.5-kilohertz? That's my first question. Ian T. Meredith - Boston Scientific Corp.: Bruce, that's a good question. And the reality is there's definitely a learning curve for the law of frequencies, but we have level-one evidence in that PROCO randomized trial. And we also have data from the WHISPER trial, and there are other studies like the NORTH study, three randomized controlled trials that showed that when properly delivered, 1 kilohertz provides excellent outcomes. But more importantly, as I said before, there are more things that determine pain relief, the optionality, the ability to use two waveforms simultaneously, a softer session, and a para-3 fib. So it is not all just about the frequency. There are other factors, amplitude, variability in amplitude, pulse sweep, duration, training. So there is really more to it than just the frequency. Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. And my second follow-up is \u2013 or my follow-up is to Mike. Mike, you seem to be taking a very aggressive view in some of your acquisitions towards really getting heft in targeted areas. So in EP you bought Apama and you bought a cryo balloon one-shot. In BPH, you're exploring both embolization as well as the NxThera approach. Could you just talk about that strategy of really going after things in a very aggressive way? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: I think I would recall it as very planful and smart because it is all planned. And as I mentioned before, many of these are companies that we already have investments in and we've been tracking for multiple years, so it's not ad-hoc. And I think the second thing is it just reinforces category leadership. We're the category leader in urology, but we didn't have an MIS play and we didn't want to spend $1 billion to acquire one. And so we felt NxThera is an excellent offering and very good for shareholders, and it creates strengthening category leadership in urology and expands our BPH beyond Greenlight. EP is a fantastic market that we're committed long term to. There are pull-through benefits to our large CRM business, and we saw an opportunity in the fastest growing segment, which is single-shot, to disrupt and be the only company to have both. And we see that segment growing likely plus 20%. And so we feel like that puts us at a competitive advantage in a fast-growth market with a differentiated portfolio that helps pull through. Same thing with Claret. We feel that Claret is a proven technology. It will have a revenue impact in the second half of this year and 2019 just like NxThera. So some of these deals will have revenue this year and next year, some of them are longer-term investments. But Claret, as Ian mentioned, is a perfect complement to our TAVR strategy, and there's upside in other indications in structural. So we think all of this reinforces category leadership in spaces that are high growth, that enhance the long-term growth profile of the company, and our team has excellent ability to execute on these. Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks so much. Susan Vissers Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: Great, with that we'd like to conclude the call.

Welcome to the Boston Scientific third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Susan Lisa. Please go ahead. Susan Vissers Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thank you, Greg, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me on today's calls are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q3 2018 results which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading, Financials and Filings. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights of Q3 2018. Dan will review the financials for the quarter and then Q4 2018 and full year 2018 guidance and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith and Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, organic revenue growth is defined as year-over-year growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and sales from the acquisition of NxThera, Claret, Augmenix, and Symetis in the relevant period to which there are no prior period related net sales. Also of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new products approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance including sales, margins, earnings and other Q3 and full year 2018 guidance as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the risk factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks a lot, Susie. Good morning, everyone. Boston Scientific delivered another quarter of excellent results as we continue our strong focus on quarterly execution while also diversifying the portfolio and building out our plans for long-term, sustainable, high-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our balanced portfolio and category leadership strategy are driving top tier performance enabling us to invest to address significant unmet clinical needs in both our core and adjacent markets. In the third quarter our team delivered 9% operational and organic revenue growth with balanced contributions from all our businesses and regions. Most of our businesses and regions continue to grow faster than the market. MedSurg led the way with 11% growth while Rhythm and Neuro grew 8%, Cardiovascular sales increased 7%, all on an organic basis. We enjoyed similar broad strength regionally with operational sales up 8% in Asia-Pac, 9% in the US, 7% in Europe/Mideast Africa, 18% in Latin America/Canada. Overall, emerging market sales grew 20% operationally, led by strong performance in China and Latin America in particular. We leveraged this worldwide 9% Q3 revenue growth to deliver adjusted EPS of $0.35 which is up 12% year over year, and at the high end of our guidance range. Boston Scientific also continues to generate excellent cash flow with $569 million in adjusted free cash flow this quarter which represents a 21% year-over-year improvement. As a result of our strong performance and confidence in our outlook, we're narrowing our full-year 2018 revenue growth guidance to the high end of prior ranges and now target 8% operational and 7% organic revenue growth with a one point contribution coming from M&A. We're also raising our Structural Heart revenue guidance from $450 million to $475 million to reflect continued WATCHMAN and ACURATE strength, plus the impact of the Claret acquisition. We're also narrowing our full-year 2018 adjusted EPS guidance range from $1.37 to $1.41 to $1.38 to $1.40. On the outperformance year-to-date, plus an incremental $0.01 of FX headwind which is now expected to be a negative $0.04 to $0.05 for the full year, versus prior expectations of $0.03 to $0.04. For the fourth quarter, we're guiding to operational revenue growth of 7% to 8% and organic growth of 6% to 7% with a one-point contribution coming from M&A. Excluding the Q4 reinvestment of our second quarter tax settlements, we are targeting Q4 2018 adjusted EPS of $0.36 to $0.38 and Dan will detail that a bit more. I'll now provide some highlights on Q3 results and our Q4 outlook. All references to growth are on an organic year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified. Our urology and public health business continued its above market global performance trend growing 12% operationally and 10% organically. This is led by mid-teens growth in our Stone franchise and sales of LithoVue continue to outperform and drive nice pull through. Sales of Men's Health products grew high single digits. Well balanced both erectile function restoration and male continence products. And our prostate health business also grew high single digits on an organic basis due to GreenLight laser therapy, international expansion, and also Rez\u016bm, which is our minimally invasive therapy for BPH via the NxThera acquisition, contributed nearly 200 basis points of growth to Uro PH overall. Also, the recently closed Augmenix acquisition enhances our category leadership strategy in Urology with the SpaceOAR hydrogel, a compelling addition to our growing prostate health treatment portfolio. Prior to radiation therapy, the SpaceOAR hydrogel is injected in office by the urologist or radiation oncologist to create additional space between the rectum and prostate during treatment, thereby reducing the amount of rectal exposure to radiation and therefore the associated side effects. Turning to Endoscopy, Endo growth accelerated 12% due to excellent momentum in our core Endo business and EndoChoice sales, including infection prevention and pathology. Looking ahead, Endo should turn in high single digit growth for the full year 2018 and is well poised to sustain this rate in 2019 as we look forward to multiple new product launches including SpyGlass Digital II, Orca's hemostasis pod for infection prevention and Orise gel for endoluminal surgery and resection of suspicious and cancerous lesions. We also remain on track with the ongoing development of our comprehensive single use scope platform, which will include the Exalt-D duodenoscope slated for year-end 2019. Plus, a bronchoscope for use in pulmonary applications, an upper GI scope for emergent bleeds and a surgical scope for pancreatic biliary applications. Neuromodulation grew an impressive 23% in the quarter, driven by the ongoing successful launch of our innovative WaveWriter Spinal Cord Stim system in the U.S. and increasing demand in Europe. In the pain segment, WaveWriter continues to gain global share due to impressive real-world results given its unique ability to offer combo waveform therapies both with paresthesia and sub-perception. We also enrolled our first patient earlier this month in the WaveWriter COMBO clinical trial which is a randomized clinical trial that will compare WaveWriter to traditional therapy. In addition, our deep brain stimulation performance and capabilities continue to expand with strong early momentum in the U.S. and continued penetration in Europe. And we're preparing for a launch of our rechargeable and primary cell DBS system with directional leads by the end of this year. And given our differentiated technology and excellent underlying market growth, we anticipate continued strength in both SCS and DBS sales. CRM sales grew above market at 3% and we continue to gain share as the number two share player globally in the high voltage defib segment. CRM sales gains were led by double-digit growth in defib sales reflecting strong global uptake of S-ICD and our RESONATE platform with its highly differentiated HeartLogic, heart failure alert. In addition to continued momentum from S-ICD, we believe HeartLogic will be a long-term key differentiator for the RESONATE platform. Phase I of our MANAGE HF HeartLogic trial should complete enrollment by the end of Q1 2019 and is intended to evaluate the clinical integration of HeartLogic in managing patients with heart failure. Turning to pacemaker segment, as forecast, sales were down low-double digits in Q3; however, last month we received FDA approval for MRI compatibility in our CRT-P devices which should improve our Brady outlook looking forward. Despite this headwind from pacing, the excellent global momentum of our defib portfolio supports our expectations for above-market CRM growth as evidenced by our low-single-digit growth year-to-date in 2018. EP sales grew 9% in the quarter, which does represent a slowdown from recent trends. We continue to invest in this high-growth market and see good growth in our Rhythmia HDx mapping and nav platform. And we're now fully launching our DirectSense and IntellaNav MiFi OI ablation catheters in Europe. We're also rolling out LumiPoint which is the first automated algorithm to assist with high definition map integration, helping EPs accelerate clinical decisions. We also continue to invest in long-term in EP with projected year-end 2019 launches for both second gen cryo- and RF-ablation single shot balloon therapies for PDI. The Cryterion and Apama single-shot platforms respectively will complement our RHYTHMIA mapping system and therapeutic catheter platforms. Within our Cardiovascular group, PI posted another impressive quarter, growing 11%. Growth was strong in all geographic regions. PI also delivered excellent growth across all three franchises, including peripheral artery disease, venous, and interventional oncology. We've also commenced the launch of Eluvia in the U.S., following both the outstanding results of the IMPERIAL trial which showed a superiority for Eluvia in the first head-to-head study of its kind and an earlier than expected FDA approval. We believe Eluvia has significant market opportunity given the large addressable patient population, its differentiated, sustained-release technology, and its demonstrated superior clinical outcomes with reduced need for reintervention. This launch is in the very early stages, but our sales team is fully trained. We've already received significant interest from physicians and healthcare systems around the country. We've also achieved two important clinical milestones in the quarter in PI. We've enrolled the first patient in our SAVAL study evaluating a purpose-built drug-eluting stent for below-the-knee lesions. And secondly, we completed enrollment in the Ranger II SFA trial, which will support a targeted 2020 U.S. launch of the Ranger drug-coated balloon. Turning now to our Interventional Cardiology business, this segment delivered 6% growth in the quarter, which is great evidence of the ongoing and successful diversification strategy of this business. Complex PCI products grew double digits through the breadth of our portfolio, new product launches and successful global expansion efforts. Our global Complex PCI results largely offset the high-single-digit declines in our coronary drug-eluting stent business. In coronary DES, we continue to work through competitive pricing headwinds, particularly in the U.S., and we're excited to be launching the new DES named Promus ELITE, which was recently FDA approved and provides a permanent polymer stent alternative for physicians while leveraging the SYNERGY delivery system. We believe that Promus ELITE will provide important support to our global tier DES segmentation strategy. Our Structural Heart programs continued to build strong momentum and we're excited about our overall performance in this significant category, which includes the defense of our intellectual property so we may continue to sustain our cycle of innovation. We're very pleased yesterday's German court ruling that granted Boston Scientific the right to enjoin Edwards Lifesciences from selling its next-gen Ultra device in Germany. As mentioned, our increased Structural Heart revenue guidance of $475 million is due to above plan results from both our WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure and ACURATE TAVR programs and a small contribution from the recently closed Claret acquisition. Claret developed Fentanyl, which is the only cerebral embolic protection system approved in the U.S. and Europe to protect patients against the risk of stroke during TAVI. We see significant opportunity for embolic protection in TAVI, both today and longer term, including usage with intermediate and low-risk patients and potentially other left heart and endovascular procedures. We believe the unique value of this technology is evidenced by the new technology add-on payment for Sentinel in the U.S., which went in effect October 1. On the clinical front, we're pleased to announce that we've completed enrollment in the 50-patient LOTUS Edge (13:38) registry and submitted that data to FDA in support of our PMA submission which we filed mid-August. We've also recently filed two IDEs with the FDA, one for the REPRISE IV study, which will be used to pursue U.S. reg approval for LOTUS Edge in intermediate TAVR patients, as well as another IDE for the ACURATE neo2 study in intermediate, high, and extreme risk TAVR patients. We've now launched ACURATE into 30 countries and continue to see excellent physician uptake for this valve, and we're excitedly prepared for the targeted LOTUS Edge launch in first quarter 2019 in Europe and mid-2019 in the U.S., which is consistent with previously communicated timelines. Turning to WATCHMAN. WATCHMAN delivered excellent growth again this quarter as the platform continues to build very strong physician support and global positioning. All key metrics are trending well, including utilization, reorder rates, and account openings. We completed enrollment in the U.S. in the NextGen WATCHMAN FLX IDE well ahead of schedule but continue to target an EU launch of FLX in the first half of 2019. Japan remains on track for WATCHMAN launch in second half of 2019 and we continue to invest in multiple WATCHMAN market development and training programs. So beyond organic objectives, our integration teams are highly focused on maximizing integration and success of the tuck-in acquisitions that we announced last year, or this year, which includes EMcision, Securus, NxThera, nVision, Claret, Cryterion, Veniti, and Augmenix. These acquisitions all target high-growth markets, enhance our category leadership strategy, leverage existing BSC global capabilities, and further enhance our short-term and long-term growth profile. Yeah, it's really a combination of our strong organic portfolio and commercial execution, along with tuck-in M&A that's led to our recently increased outlook for 7% to 10% operational revenue growth CAGR in 2019 and 2020. We also continue to absorb the near-term dilution of these multiple tuck-in transactions and a greater FX hit while continuing to deliver on our commitment to double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our core business has very strong momentum, and our pipeline due to both internal and external initiatives has never been stronger. We believe we are uniquely positioned to drive shareholder value due to our long-term growth profile, continued potential for operating and margin improvements, commitment to double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and improving ability to deploy capital. So, I want thank our employees for their winning spirit, their commitment to advancing science for life, and Mr. Brennan will now provide a detailed review of our financials. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Mike. Third quarter consolidated revenue of $2.393 billion represents 7.7% reported revenue growth and reflects a $31 million headwind from foreign exchange, which compares unfavorably to the tailwind of up to $10 million we expected at the time of guidance. On an operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, revenue growth was 9.1% in the quarter compared to our guidance of 7% to 8% growth. The outperformance was once again across the board, both on a business and regional basis. In Q3, sales from recent acquisitions, primarily NxThera ad Claret, contributed approximately 40 basis points to total company growth, resulting in organic revenue growth of 8.7%. With this strong sales performance, we delivered Q3 adjusted earnings per share of $0.35, representing 12% year-over-year growth and at the high end of our guidance range of $0.33 to $0.35. Notably, this $0.35 in the quarter includes approximately $0.02 of negative FX impact, which is $0.01 to $0.02 greater than our expected $0.00 to $0.01 headwind at the time of guidance. Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 72.7%, above our guidance range of 71.5% to 72% and represents an increase of 50 basis points year over year, despite a 50 basis point negative year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. This FX hit was more than offset by a mixed benefit from strong performance in our Neuromodulation business, WATCHMAN, and Men's Health franchises, as well as continued benefit from operational improvements and manufacturing cost reductions. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $849 million or 35.5% of sales in Q3, at the high end of the range and up slightly year-over-year as we continue to fund initiatives related to recent acquisitions and focus on key commercial launches. Adjusted research and development expenses were $261 million in the quarter or 10.9% of sales, at the high end of our range, given robust clinical spend and down slightly year-over-year. Royalty expense was 0.7% of sales, roughly flat year-over-year. As a result, adjusted operating margin was 25.6% in the quarter, towards the high end of our guidance range of 25.25% to 25.75% and represents a 50-basis-point increase year over year, which was driven by the strong adjusted gross margin result. We continue to expect our full-year adjusted operating margin to be in a range of 25.5% to 25.75%, consistent with the goals outlined at the start of the year. We believe we can deliver 50 to 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement in 2019 and 2020 as well, while also investing in our businesses and developing our recent acquisitions to drive 7% to 10% operational revenue growth. Moving to below the line in interest and other expense, interest expense for the quarter was roughly flat to last year at $58 million versus $57 million in Q3 last year. Our average interest rate expense was 3.2% in Q3 this year compared to 3.7% in Q3 of last year. Adjusted other expense was $12 million in the third quarter and primarily included dilution from our equity method investments, adjustments to investments accounted for under the measurement alternative, as well as transactional foreign exchange losses including hedging costs. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 5.3% on a reported basis and 10.5% on an adjusted basis, below our guidance range of 13% to 14% as a result of a lower operational rate from greater clarity related to the tax reform and its impact on our tax structure. Further, we delivered Q3 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $0.35, which includes an FX headwind of $0.02. On a reported basis, GAAP EPS of $0.31 includes net charges and amortization expenses after tax of $53 million for the quarter. We ended Q3 with $1.404 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $569 million compared to $469 million in Q3 last year. In the quarter we used cash and short-term debt to fund our recent acquisitions, as well as previously agreed upon legal settlements. We continue to expect 2018 adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $1.9 billion. We're also making good progress on our mesh litigation with approximately 97% of all of our known claims settled or in the final stages of settlement. In the quarter, we increased our forward-looking accrual for legal fees associated with the remaining mesh cases by $18 million, but we continue to believe that our reserved amounts for case are sufficient to finalize the remaining cases and claims. Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $1.162 billion as of September 30, 2018, a decrease of $102 million from the $1.264 billion as of June 30, 2018. In the quarter, we made cash payments of over $100 million into the qualified settlement fund, which is shown as restricted cash on our balance sheet. Our current balance of restricted cash, which is primarily related to the qualified settlement fund, is $781 million. As a result, we have approximately $300 million left to fund and the remaining balance sheet liability will be released as funds are released out of the qualified settlement fund to plaintiffs, which should occur in Q4 with a small portion in the first half of 2019 to complete the process. Capital expenditures for the third quarter 2018 were $77 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $350 million for the year as we build capacity, integrate acquisitions, and drive growth. I'll now walk through guidance for Q4 and full-year 2018. For the full year, we expect consolidated 2018 revenue to be in the range of $9.787 billion to $9.827 billion as we narrow our full-year organic revenue growth guidance from 6% to 7% to simply 7%. We expect the contribution from acquisitions to be an additional 80 basis points of growth for the full year. Note that this includes the recently closed Augmenix acquisition as well as contributions from NxThera, Claret and Symetis in the relevant periods. For the full year we now expect foreign exchange to be a tailwind of approximately $50 million to $60 million for full-year 2018 revenue, which is a significant decrease from our prior expectations of a $125 million to $150 million tailwind due to the strengthening U.S. dollar against most major currencies. We continue to expect our adjusted gross margin for the year as a percentage of sales to be approximately 72% for the full year, which now assumes a negative FX impact of 80 basis points for the full year, down slightly from our prior guidance of 90 basis points. We now expect our full-year adjusted SG&A expense to be at the high end of our previous range at approximately 35% of sales, as we're seeing the benefits of operating expense control programs currently underway while also investing to further enhance our short-term and long-term growth profile, particularly with initiatives related to our recent acquisitions. Similarly, we now expect full-year adjusted R&D spending to be approximately 10.5% to 11% of sales and continue to expect full-year royalty rates to remain at slightly less than 1% of sales for 2018. This implies a full-year 2018 adjusted operating margin in a range of 25.5% to 25.75%, which is consistent with prior guidance. Turning to tax, we now expect our full-year 2018 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 12%, which reflects an operational rate of approximately 13% and an approximate 100 basis points of benefit from the accounting standard for stock compensation, the majority of which was already reflected in our year-to-date tax rate. As a reminder, we recorded a $0.06, or $82 million noncash tax benefit in Q4 resulting from the IRS settlement for the 2001 to 2010 tax years. As previously disclosed, we continue to explore strategies to reinvest this $0.06 tax benefit into our tax structure with the goal of reducing our operational tax rate in 2019 and beyond, below our previously announced goal of 15%. The strategies we are exploring would optimize our structure, leveraging differences in tax rates by jurisdictions. Based on the work we've completed to date, we believe this $0.06 reinvestment will not have a material cash consequence. It will occur in Q4 of 2018 and will result in an approximate 27% adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter. Given that our year-to-date adjusted tax rate through Q3 is 6.5%, this Q4 adjusted tax rate of 27% will result in our full year adjusted guidance of 12%; thus you can see there is no impact to our full-year adjusted tax rate as we're simply reinvesting the $82 million benefit in Q4 that we recorded in Q2. Accordingly, we do not expect an impact of full-year adjusted earnings per share as a result of either the Q2 tax benefit or the Q4 re-investment. To be clear, our fourth quarter EPS guidance, which I will discuss in a moment, will include this reinvestment expense of $0.06. However, we encourage you to exclude both the Q2 benefit of $0.06 and the Q4 reinvestment of $0.06 when you model the underlying business performance thus net neutral to full-year 2018 adjusted EPS. Moving below the line, we continue to expect these expenses which include interest payments, dilution from our venture capital portfolio and costs associated with our hedging program to be approximately $300 million for the full year. Finally, we expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.405 billion shares for Q4 and 1.401 billion shares for the full year 2018. We're narrowing our full-year 2018 adjusted earnings per share range to $1.38 to $1.40 representing 10% to 11% adjusted earnings growth. Importantly, this now includes a negative FX impact of $0.04 or $0.05 which is an increase of $0.01 versus prior expectations of $0.03 to $0.04 due to recent rate movements. While FX continues to be a headwind for us in 2018, we believe if rates hold constant, FX should become relatively neutral for our EPS in 2019, as we've previously said, but we will provide additional details with our guidance in early 2019. As a reminder, in addition to the $0.04 to $0.05 of negative FX, our adjusted EPS guidance also includes $0.02 to $0.03 of dilution expected from product and market development activities required for the acquisitions we've completed in 2018, consistent with our Q2 earnings call. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $1.08 to $1.10. Now turning to Q4, 2018, we expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $2.525 billion to $2.565 billion representing year-over-year organic growth of 6% to 7%. Our guidance for the fourth quarter reflects the ongoing momentum from the business but also has the more difficult comp from Q4 last year which is 250 basis points greater than the Q3 2017 comp on an organic basis. In the fourth quarter, we expect an additional 120 basis points contribution from recent acquisitions and expect the foreign exchange impact to be a headwind of $30 million to $40 million. For the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.30 to $0.32 per share, including the expected $0.06 reinvestment of the Q2 2018 tax benefit, and representing an EPS decline of 13% to 7% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the expected $0.06 tax reinvestment, our adjusted earnings per share guidance is $0.36 to $0.38 which represents 4% to 10% growth, and we encourage you to model using this guidance range. Fourth quarter GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.15 to $0.17 per share. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q3 2018 financial and operational highlights which outlines Q3 results as well as Q4 and full-year 2018 guidance, including P&L line item guidance. With that, I'll turn it back to Susie who will moderate the Q&A. Susan Vissers Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Dan. Greg, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. Please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Greg, please go ahead. Operator : Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Oh, thanks and good morning. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Morning, Bob. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Morning, Bob. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Morning. So, just two quick things and congrats on another very strong quarter. First, just given the announcement yesterday on the German court ruling, I have sort of a procedural question. So, now you guys have the right to enjoin Edwards in Germany. Is there f a date by which you need to make a decision on next steps and whether or not you'll enforce that injunction? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yes, for the Ultra injunction that was announced yesterday, it's 30 days. So, it's basically November 23. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So, you need to make a decision by then on what you're going to do? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: On Ultra, yes. On S3 Ultra, yes. That's correct. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And then just a question, a little bit of a bigger picture question. The Street obviously has a lot of confidence in your ability to drive top-line growth, but it's always hard for us to model certain things like short-term deal dilution and I appreciate your comments on currency. But on the notion of short-term deal-related dilution, could you offer any preliminary thoughts on what the impact of that deal dilution might be for next year relative to the $0.02 to $0.03 this year? And just maybe some preliminary thoughts on whether or not the Street is accurately capturing those headwinds in the current consensus of $1.58? Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah, Bob, we won't give a specific number relative to what the dilution is. We did give that, obviously, for this year being that $0.02 to $0.03. I'm happy that we have the financial strength that's allowing to us offset that this year and that's always the goal. As we've always stated and consistently delivered, our goal is double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth and I would assume that that's no different as we head forward. So, it's about making a tradeoff. We certainly want to make sure we give the care and feeding necessary to those acquisitions so they can drive that 7% to 10% growth for 2019 and 2020 and hopefully beyond that timeframe as well. And we're pretty well-heeled in making those tradeoffs and delivering that double-digit EPS growth. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : But you don't think the Street is missing anything big picture? Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: I wouldn't comment on, specifically on what the Street has. We'll obviously give guidance in early 2019, but our goal is always double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth and should be no different going forward. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Fair enough. Thank you very much. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Bob. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Just two for me. One on the top and one on the bottom. Just looking to the fourth quarter, guys, you're modeling to modest organic acceleration into the fourth quarter, which I think is notable only because you haven't done that all year. So, what are some of those drivers in the fourth quarter and what does that tell us, if anything, about your confidence in organic acceleration heading into 2019? And then I had a quick follow-up. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Dave. I think if you just look at the business, it's broadly-based. It's performing at a pretty high level. Strong diversification across them with, in third quarter, MedSurg growing 11%, Rhythm and Neuro 8%, Cardio 7%. So, as you look to the fourth quarter and also the regions, U.S. 9%, Europe 7%, and Asia 8%, so we're seeing very well-balanced, diversified growth across regions and businesses and we expect that momentum to continue in fourth quarter. We did have some important new approvals like Eluvia, but we don't anticipate that making a significant impact until really first quarter 2019. So, we really see just the continued momentum of the business and we continue to invest for what will be this 7% to 10% operational growth CAGR in 2019-2020. So it's really just a continuation of our momentum that we have, new product launches. And as you indicated, we have a tougher comp in fourth quarter, about 250 basis points higher than third quarter. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: But, Mike, is it reasonable to assume \u2013 obviously, we're getting operational acceleration next year. Should we also expect organic acceleration next year? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah, we'll give guidance in due course here. We talk about 7% to 10%, and during that piece we think about 150 basis points of that 7% to 10% comes from M&A. So, that leaves 5.5% to 8.5% organic, which is pretty strong. And we've got \u2013 you heard in my comments that were lengthy that we've got significant product launches coming across each major segment. So, we're very confident in that 7% to 10% and we've got a nice track record delivering it. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And very helpful and clear, Mike. And then, Dan, just a couple follow-ups here on earnings next year. I know you're not, in keeping with historic practice, not going to give us the number for 2019, unfortunately. But there are a couple pieces in your script I wanted to push you on a little bit. The first is FX. Most people would have assumed an FX headwind next year, certainly to revenue. You mentioned neutral effect to earnings. Maybe help us understand that. The tax reinvestment this year, does it imply that we could see some positive movement on the tax rate for next year? And then the 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion, are you still confident in that number, even if you move forward with the significant Millipede investment? Thanks so much. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah, sure. There's a lot there. Let me hit them one at a time. So, FX, yes. We've obviously kind of snapped the line with where rates are today and have a very successful hedging program that we've put in place over time. And with what we see today with where rates are today, we'd kind of see FX being neutral at an EPS line as we get to 2019. Obviously, when we give guidance, we'll update that, but that's kind of where we'd be today. Tax, yes. If we're successful in being able to reinvest, which we believe we will be, reinvest that $0.06, $82 million one-time benefit here in the fourth quarter, we would expect to be able to bring down that 15% operational tax rate guidance that we've given for 2019 and 2020. So, that is clearly the goal and we'll give you more information on that when we give guidance. And then the 50 to 100 basis point, yes, that's the goal that we've had, that's the goal we've established and for 2019 and 2020, that should absolutely be doable. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Mills from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. Jason Richard Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Good morning, Mike and Dan. Thanks for taking the question. Have a more 20,000-foot question on MedSurg and then a question on U.S. Structural Heart. First on MedSurg, Mike, that business has been a leader for you, both in growth and margins for quite some time, and not all that much of your M&A activity has occurred in MedSurg. Could you talk a bit about the targeted addressable markets in MedSurg? You've gotten into BPH now, Augmenix is a new TAM. Could you talk about those TAMs merging with the existing ones that you already have relative to the rest of your business? I know you're excited about all of your business, but this one gets maybe a little bit less attention. I'd just be interested in your assessment of the TAMs there over the longer term. And then I had a follow-up on the Structural Heart. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah. So, thanks for the question. We spend a lot of internal time on our Endo and Uro businesses. We think they have really unique category leadership in the industry in MedTech. Both of them do, at this point, and significant scale now globally. So, you know, just the Endo business, there has been lighter M&A activity in the Endo business. Very high percentage of that business is revenue growth, which has been impressive, being 12% in Q3 through organic initiatives. And so, we invest a strong amount in R&D, being very efficient with it and we've got a strong product cadence and we continue to expand globally, but a little bit less M&A activity and more organic the last 12 months in Endo. Uro, we've been very active with M&A. We've done three acquisitions in Uro. Really, we think \u2013 I hate to say \u2013 I won't say cement. That's too cocky, but to really give us a very strong category leadership position in urology with the recent acquisitions of Augmenix, NxThera and also expansion into Women's Health with nVision. So, it's a similar playbook as Endo. They're a little less diversified in terms of the geographic commercial results. But they're just very strong portfolios, very strong innovation cadence coming, and maybe most importantly, divisions that they deliver on their commitments and they continue to invest for the long term. On the total adjustable market, I don't know, Dan, do you have any comments on that? Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah, we really haven't \u2013 It's part of the kind of the mid to high teens of billions of markets that we're adding over the next two to three years in the new technologies that we're addressing, both organically and also through acquisitions. So, we haven't given specific numbers. We did include in the financial operations highlights on our website a nice little summary of acquisitions. So, you can kind of refer to that, but we haven't put out the TAM buy acquisition at this point. I'd imagine we'll talk more about that as we get to Investor Day next year as well. Jason Richard Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: That's helpful. I guess, Mike and Dan, where I was going with that is it's been a leader in both growth and margins for a while. Given the acquisitions, would you expect that to continue say over the next couple of years? And then I'll just ask my follow-up as well. In Structural Heart, clearly when you had to pull back a little bit on LOTUS in the U.S. market for TAVR, it seemed WATCHMAN benefited from the incremental focus from that sales force in the United States. And so, as you prepare for launch in the United States with LOTUS Edge, how might your sales force change? Will you need to add to it? Will there be incremental spending there? Or do you feel like you're ready at this point to market both products full force whenever the FDA approves LOTUS Edge? Thank you very much. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. I can take the acquisition one and then Mike can do the second one. So on the acquisition front, we've obviously done a series of acquisitions this year. Still have a tremendous amount of financial flexibility; debt to EBITDA 2.4 times at the end of Q3, obviously, putting some of the legacy liabilities, particularly mesh, behind us. So, as you look at 2019 and 2020 and cash flow that hopefully should be north of $2 billion in each of those years, still gives us ample capacity to be able to continue to execute our strategy, which is category leadership. So, I would look for us to continue to do acquisitions that fill out the portfolio. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah, and on the sales coverage area, we feel very comfortable there. In terms of WATCHMAN which is doing really remarkably well, it's all about increasing utilization. So, the sales reps' requirements to open up new centers really has declined significantly over the past three years because we have so many centers that are open. So, there's still a few new center openings that account for the revenue but the bulk of it really is a combination of what we call therapy awareness reps, helping, working in partnership with the customers or the hospitals to drive awareness, physician training, and increased utilization. And so, it's a pretty significant, I would say, clinical exercise and therapy awareness exercise, and a little bit less on the traditional sales, new account openings. That will now shift over to the TAVR responsibility for a lot of those reps. So, by geography, there's different models. Sometimes we have separate reps, sometimes we combine reps. It depends on what the situation is. But we'll continue to invest in both our WATCHMAN clinical team and also continue to make investments as we do a smart launch of our LOTUS platform in the U.S. with clinical reps and sales reps. . Jason Richard Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. One on Eluvia, one on litigation. So, starting with Eluvia, Mike, can you talk a little bit about the pricing strategy? We've heard you've priced it at a substantial premium to Zilver in the U.S. Can you talk about your plans and expectations for a new tech add-on payment and a pass-through payment and how that could impact near-term and mid-term Eluvia sales? And I had one follow-up. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah, thank you very much. You did a nice report on that this week. Well done. So, I really won't comment on our pricing strategy, really for competitive reasons. And so, we do think that Eluvia has demonstrated superior results with the platform, given the IMPERIAL data and so we do believe that the product should be priced at a premium, and we are pursuing an NTAP in the inpatient environment. And so, we'll hopefully hear news on that by the end of the first quarter time period. So, we think a combination of the superior results should help drive a premium price and we'll work smartly to try to receive additional reimbursement add-on payments currently as planned in the inpatient center. Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. And Mike, it would seem that the Edwards litigation is ripe for some type of resolution soon because you only have 30 days, as you mentioned earlier to exercise your option to enjoin Ultra in Germany. If you don't exercise your option on Ultra, you'd lose some of your leverage. Investors have assumed that you haven't enjoined Sapien 3 in Germany because you've been supply constrained, but that situation I believe is changing. I'd love to hear your thoughts on those topics. Thanks for taking the questions. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah, so the great news is, as you know, we've made really strong progress with both LOTUS and ACURATE. So, our ability to supply with ACURATE has been significantly enhanced over the past year, the ops team's done a great job with that and we continue to actually build another facility to support ACURATE. And we're excited about the launch of LOTUS in Europe. So overall, the strength and capabilities of our TAVR supply and capabilities continue to get stronger. I won't make any comments other than we're really pleased and it's the results that we expected. So, we have really demonstrated in proving our patents out in Germany with S3, including the appeal trial and we're pleased with the results of the Ultra enjoinment with ACURATE's capability. So, we've got some options here and I think we'll continue to play it out. Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I have two of them. The first one is is, could you give us a little bit of a State of the Union on your Neuromodulation franchise? This year, you have sales of the WaveWriter SCS and the Vercise DBS, which is helping that along. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. Just \u2013 I'm sorry, just broad comments on how we're doing with SCS and DBS? Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Whatever you can share would be wonderful. Thank you. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Okay. Yeah, I think Maulik and our global team have done a very nice job. We've talked about WaveWriter for a while and its ability to have the diversity, flexibility of waveforms, paresthesia based and non-paresthesia based. And I think really what we're seeing is the adoption of that and then longer-term clinical benefits. So, we're seeing stronger reorder rates from current customers as we continue to grab new physicians as well. So, I think it's really the proven clinical outcomes that's driving the adoption at comfort level and we continue to try to improve the ease of use of training and programming, which we'll continue to do in 2019 to drive more adoption. And also, you're seeing greater outside the U.S. \u2013 I hate that word, but greater adoption in Europe and the Asia markets for our Spinal Cord Stim business. In DBS, we're early phases in U.S. Europe's really the footprint there, the blueprint for the U.S. We have our new platforms all approved in Europe and we're doing quite well there. And in Deep Brain Stimulation, that should be a nice tailwind for us in 2019, once we have our directional lead approved which we expect likely by the end of this year, early first quarter. So, DBS should be nice additional boost for us in 2019. We'll have some tougher comps for Spinal Cord Stim throughout 2019, but the business has a lot of momentum. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. And as my follow-up, I want to shift a little bit to the Structural Heart franchise. In Europe, you have ACURATE in 30 centers, how do you think about now launching LOTUS into that market and into those centers? And then anything that you can share with us on how you plan on approaching the United States next year would be great. Thank you. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah, so, Dr. Meredith can comment. We're pleased with our ACURATE performance and LOTUS coming back to market in Europe. A lot of physicians have broad experience in Europe with LOTUS prior to us pulling it off the markets. And so, there's a lot of enthusiasm for doctors to get LOTUS back in their hands. I was just over in Italy last week, and it's very encouraging to hear. You had many ACURATE users at this large confidence in Italy, many doctors who had used LOTUS before and they see \u2013 some doctors see specific clinical areas, bicuspid or heavy calcified valves that they want to use LOTUS. Some want to use it routinely. And so I think having the combination of both platforms gives us a unique competitive advantage. And then, I think what you'll see particularly in the U.S. and a little more slowly in Europe is the support of Claret, the embolic protection. So that business and opportunity continues to grow. So, I think offering physicians the uniqueness of both ACURATE and LOTUS with Claret positions us pretty well. Dr. Meredith any comments? Ian T. Meredith - Boston Scientific Corp.: I can't really add much, Mike, other than that they clearly are complementary and while both valves could be a workhorse, there will be specific indications for the use of both. But perhaps one thing I could add is that LOTUS will be an ideal valve for low-volume users just simply because it's completely repositionable. So, we see that the added advantage of LOTUS in low volume on new centers as well. So, complementary strategy, obviously specific indications might favor one over the other, but it's a case of better to have two than one. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Joanne. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. First question on ICD growth in the quarter. Very strong. You called out S-ICD, you called out RESONATE. There's also a replacement tailwind. But was there any one driver that stood out or did all three of those drivers equally contribute to the strong growth in the quarter? And I had a follow-up. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Sure. They all contributed. The greatest contributions come from S-ICD and RESONATE and the tailwind from the replacement's kind of about a point or so. So, more significant contribution from the execution of the launches. And I think S-ICD, and Dr. Stein can comment, it just continues to build momentum and I think greater comfort level with physicians. We see that business really growing extremely well in Asia, Europe and the U.S. as the clinical data continues to be strong and comfort level. So, I think that's a continued long-term competitive advantage for us with S-ICD. And, I give to Joe and the team a lot of credit for HeartLogic. That was a significant investment over multiple years, and I think it's positioned the RESONATE platform to have a uniquely differentiated heart failure alert that we believe will perform significantly better than competitors' products that had previously been in the market but, quite frankly, not used. And so we think this will be a very unique opportunity to reduce heart failure readmissions and to differentiate the RESONATE beyond its longevity and other capabilities. Dr. Stein, any further thoughts there? Kenneth Stein, M.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.: No, thanks, Mike. Yeah, Glenn, I would just sort of add maybe a little bit of color to what Mike said. Again, S-ICD I think very clearly has increased comfort, particularly in the U.S. We did report results as a late-breaker HRS earlier this year showing significant reduction in appropriate shocks with our new SMART Pass filter technology, and those results I think have had an impact in increasing folks' comfort using it. And then particularly in Japan, we've been very pleased with the uptake of the device in that market. And in terms of heart failure and the RESONATE launch, again, having the only FDA-approved alert system for OED compensation and heart failure is really getting us traction in not just among our implanting physician community but also in the referring physician community and particularly in the heart failure community and that's had a significant impact in enabling us to drive growth in our high voltage devices. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then, just as a follow-up, you had, as you mentioned, across the board strength here in the third quarter with the only areas of weakness being U.S. drug eluting stents and pacemakers. But in your prepared remarks, you highlighted a new drug eluting stent launch, you highlighted new pacing launches. So as I think about 2019, can these businesses improve and can these businesses actually grow for you in 2019? Thanks. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Well, we'll outline that quite a bit more in the coming months. I think the pacemaker piece should improve generally in 2019 with new product launches and easier comps. And defibs will be a little bit trickier in 2019 with tougher comps, but we have a unique platform that we just talked about with RESONATE and S-ICD to continue to grow that. So, I think broadly in 2019, you'll see CRM continue to grow above market. I know a lot of companies say that, but we actually continue to do that in CRM. So, I think that'll be good. I think in DES, that's our toughest segment in terms of market, given the pricing pressure there. But this ELITE solution will be a nice segmented offering because what it will enable us to do is offer customers who want better economics, a permanent polymer stent to match our two biggest competitors, global competitors, and then to further differentiate our synergy bioresorbable polymer at more of a premium. So, it's a nice way for us to position best in class delivery system with synergy with a durable polymer to match some of the competitive headwinds that we see in price. And then use that to then further differentiate synergy a bit more. So, I think it's a nice strategy, and hopefully we'll see some improvement next year in DES. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : All right. Thanks, Mike. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan, please go ahead. Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk about the sustainability of Urology. We saw mid-teens growth in Stone and high-single digit in Men's Health. That's well above the market. Maybe help us understand what's driving that and what are some of the product launches and dynamics that could help to keep that where it is? Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yes, happy to do that. The Urology business has \u2013 we have a lot of faith in it. First of all, we have a very strong leadership team there globally that delivers on the commitments and that's why we've tripled down with three acquisitions in that business this year. It's a \u2013 I would say broadly the demographics are very good. The ability for us to expand that business globally are significant. It's our least global business that we have in terms of the revenue mix and higher concentration in the U.S. So, I would start off with we have a very strong team. I could talk about the portfolio second. The international expansion efforts are likely the greatest of all the divisions at Boston in Urology. And then third, we just had a very, very strong innovation cadence and current pipeline. We just recently, in the last month continue to advance our ability in stone retrieval with a combination delivery platform, as well as a basket combined into one user interface. I'm blanking on the name of the new product, but the team continues to reinvent and innovate in core Stone through that device as well as our visualization capabilities. And that uniqueness is driving pull through of the core business. And then you're seeing very strong additional new market entries with our NxThera BPH platform that complements our laser platform. We're very excited about Augmenix and the ability for us to leverage our commercial footprint and offer that platform to radiation oncologists as well as to urologists in the outpatient center. It's already reimbursed, nice FDA approval. So, I think you're seeing just very strong core products, innovation in our core, and these new adjacencies in global growth. And late-breaker news, the name of that product I was thinking of is LithoVue Empower. . Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Coming out of TCP there's a lot of excitement in the mitral valve, the tricuspid space. You have the Millipede device which you're going to close on that transaction in early next year if I'm not mistaken. Can you maybe spend a minute on your strategy in mitral and tricuspid and help us understand maybe what's in the pipeline or is the scenario that we should see continued investment in externally? Thanks. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: I'll have Dr. Ian Meredith help me out on that one. Ian T. Meredith - Boston Scientific Corp.: Thank you very much. Obviously, mitral valve disease is a very important space. Ageing community globally, and increasing burden of heart failure, so the treatment of functional mitral regurgitation by percutaneous approach, I think is here to stay. And we certainly saw those results with COAPT, which actually fueled this. So obviously, first step for Millipede is to complete the current study, the requirements we have in the current study and then to arrange a CFS study and a concomitant CE Mark study then plan our U.S. IDE strategy thereafter. And course this is a foundational element to our functional mitral regurgitation and indeed tricuspid valve platform. So, you'll need a toolbox to do this, as we say. It's not one device to treat all problems. So, we see the annuloplasty device, subcutaneous annuloplasty device as being foundational, very good standalone treatment for functional mitral regurgitation, but it also provides a basis for other therapies to be added on in the future as well. Susan Vissers Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: Greg, we'll take one more, please. Operator : Okay. Your final question today comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Hey, guys, congrats on a nice quarter and thanks for taking my question. Two really quick ones. One, LOTUS, I didn't get the timeline for the launch in Europe, so if you could clarify that. And second, Dan, on EPS headwinds from FX, it looks like Street had mis-modeled on the FX headwinds. Would we be accurate in thinking, versus Street models, maybe FX is a little bit \u2013 we should be modeling a little bit more headwinds into 2019, just given where rates are? Thank you. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Yeah, I can take the FX. Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.: The first one's easier, first quarter. First quarter LOTUS, Europe. Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.: Right. First quarter 2019 for LOTUS in Europe and FX actually is pretty easy as well. I think I hit part of this in the prepared remarks. For 2019, if you look at where rates are today, if you kind of snap that line today with where our rates are and where our hedging programs are, we would say it's neutral. So, just I would say it's neutral for 2019. Depending on where things go from now to then, we'll update you when we give guidance, but I think putting it in neutral for now is probably a safe bet. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks, guys. Susan Vissers Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.: With that, we'd like to conclude the call. Thanks for joining us today and appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific. Before you disconnect, Greg will give you all the pertinent details for the replay. Thanks, Greg. Operator : Thank you.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, my name is Sharon, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apollo Endosurgery Fourth Quarter and Full- Year 2018 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. John Gillings, you may begin your conference. John Gillings : Thanks, operator, and thanks, everyone, for participating in today\u2019s call. Joining me on the call are Todd Newton, Chief Executive Officer, and Stefanie Cavanaugh, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including Apollo\u2019s financial outlook, Apollo\u2019s plans and timing for product development and sales. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties and Apollo\u2019s actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed today, March 18, 2019, with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is only accurate as of the date of the live broadcast, March 18, 2019. Except as required by law, Apollo undertakes no obligation to revise or update any statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. During this call, we will interchangeably use the terms ESS for OverStitch and the terms IGB for Orbera and vice versa. In this call, we will also refer to the term continuing product revenue, which excludes the revenue associated with our surgical products, which we divested on December 17, 2018. Continuing products revenue will defer from our GAAP revenue as we will still report historical and transitional surgical product sales as part of our GAAP revenues. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Newton : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today\u2019s call to discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 results. The fourth quarter was a very productive quarter as we materially recast and restructured our business for better long-term shareholder success. In December, we shared our declining and underperforming surgical product line. Our goals with this transaction were to create a more focused company, monetized and non-strategic asset and remove a barrier to our top line growth profile. The final deal structure was somewhat complex, but we estimate the combined proceeds from the various agreements in the transaction will provide us an equivalent amount of cash flow over the next three years as the surgical product line would have contributed had we continued to own and operate it. Both before and after, the surgical product line divestiture OverStitch is our top selling product. In the fourth quarter, OverStitch was 64% of our continuing product sales and grew 46% over the fourth quarter of last year. And since the beginning of February, we have been in the full launch of the new single channel compatible OverStitch what we call OverStitch Sx in the United States and our European direct markets. We remain bullish as well on the Intragastric Balloon\u2019s market prospects. The U.S. market development effort has been rocking up to now, to say the least, but in the fourth quarter we put in place a number of programs with some of our most capable customers to support the current weight loss season that kicked off in January with the New Year. We also see progress from our efforts to position the non-surgical weight loss from Orbera as a high value treatment option for various medical needs such as fatty liver disease as was shown last year during Digestive Disease Week, and I\u2019ll talk more about this shortly. And lastly, we are very pleased to share with you on this call the refinancing of our long-term debt. Our new facility was solar capital is more tailored to our restructured business and its needs. I\u2019ll turn the call over now to Stephanie and then I\u2019ll come back with some more comments on various initiatives that we have underway. Stefanie? Stefanie Cavanaugh : Thank you, Todd, and good morning everyone. ESS sales increased to 46% to $6.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus $4.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Sales in the United States increased 47% to $3.4 million; and outside the U.S., ESS sales increased 44% to $3.6 million. For the year, ESS product sales were 23.4 million, an increase of 42%. ESS growth have been achieved from both expanded proceedings within existing accounts and the existing new customers. Intragastric Balloon or IGB sales were $3.9 million in the fourth quarter versus $5 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Sales in international markets were roughly three quarters of our total IGB revenue in the fourth quarter and amounted to $2.9 million. This was a decline of 24%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, and was primarily due to lower sales to distributors. In direct market, ongoing market share gains in Europe, where we have available in the Orbera365 product were offset by declines in Brazil. In the United States, IGB sales declined approximately [$240,000] versus the fourth quarter of last year, or roughly 120 fewer balloons sold. This reduction is primarily due to continuing weakening market conditions that have persisted since the June 2018 FDA letter to healthcare professionals. In total, continuing product revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 10%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 with $10.8 million. Our GAAP fourth quarter revenue of $15.2 million included $4.1 million of surgical product sales, which we divested as announced on December 18. For the full-year, continuing product sales of $41.1 million increased 15%, while GAAP sales, which includes divested surgical product revenues declined 5% to $60.9 million. Gross margin for the fourth quarter 2018 was 46.6%, compared to 57.7% in the prior year period, and for the full-year 2018 gross margin was 54.5%, compared to 61.8% for 2017. There were two very distinct factors influencing our lower gross margin percentage this quarter; one of which is part of an ongoing trend, and one that is due to a deliberate effort on our part to bring down our finished goods inventory in the fourth quarter of this year. First, the ongoing trend is one we have spoken of often in the past, as our sales metrics shifted from the decline in surgical products with higher gross margins to Endo-bariatric products and especially to our ESS product line, which has a lower gross margin, our over gross margin has declined. Second, as we also have discussed in the past, we have been actively pursuing [three-named projects], aimed at improving our Endo-bariatric product gross margin over the past few years. In 2017, this was the transfer of the Helix from a contract manufacturer to our facility and in 2018, this was the transfer of the Cinch, as well as changes we made to various components of our IGB product. In preparation of these projects, in 2017 we increased our finished goods inventory to protect us in the event that the transfer products were delayed for some reason. With the completion in these projects, we took efforts to bring down our finished goods inventory in the fourth quarter.  As our transitional risks have dissipated, we have lowered our finished goods from over 10 million at the end of 2017 to 5.8 million at the end of 2018, with approximately 3 million of this reduction occurring in the fourth quarter. And this was a favorable trend. However, it also means that more of our manufacturing overhead costs was charged to cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter than in other periods even though our fourth quarter manufacturing overhead spend is materially unchanged. Total operating expenses were $23.9 million for the fourth quarter 2018, compared to $15.2 million in the fourth quarter 2017. The largest contributor to this increase in operating expense was the loss on divestiture of the surgical product line of $7.8 million. Excluding this one-time loss, total operating expenses were 16.2 million, an increase of 6% or roughly 1 million over the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase was mainly due to higher research and development expenses resulting from higher clinical trial activities, new product development costs, and costs incurred in connection with our various gross margin improvement projects. For the full-year, excluding the loss on sale of the surgical product line, operating expenses for 2018 was 65.5 million, compared to 62.2 million for 2017, an increase of 5%, due primarily to higher research and development across all quarters of the unit. Our net loss for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $18.4 million, compared to $7.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the loss on divestiture, our net loss would have been $10.6 million.  Again, excluding the loss on divestiture from full-year results, net loss would have been $38 million, compared to $27.3 million in 2017. Along with our results, we announced in this morning\u2019s press release that we closed our new senior secured credit facility with Solar Capital Limited.  At closing, we borrowed 35 million, which was due to retire our prior credit facilities that would tend to mature in February 2020. After payoff and all associated transaction cost, the borrowings will increase our cash on hand $11.6 million. Additionally, the facility has the potential to be increased by another 15 million at the mutual agreement of our self and new vendor. The facility is also tailored to our restructured business. Whereby future financial covenants are exclusively based on our endo-product performance, and future payments we receive from the sale of our Surgical business can be used for general corporate purposes, while in our previous credit agreement these receipts were required to be used to pay down loan principal. Lastly, the credit agreement does not in include any warrant covenants. Our objectives for our refinancing were to fully refinance our existing debt. Second, to extend our cash run rate position. Third, be reflective of our restructured business. And fourth, to have minimal dilution. We think these objectives have been accomplished. And I will now turn it back to Todd. Todd Newton : Thank you, Stefanie. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we kicked off the full launch of the OverStitch Sx in early February in the US and European markets. We have high expectations for Sx, as it allows us to take flexible Endoscopic Suturing from a niche application that required its physician to have access to a niche endoscope to a mainstream readily available solution for any physician who is performing flexible endoscopy. The primary focus in the early stages of our Sx launch is to expand our user base, especially with physicians who have core GI application needs. Like the established OverStitch device, Sx will deliver the same full-thickness suturing and give clinicians the ability to customize their suture pattern for the broad range of treatment needs that the therapeutic endoscopist encounters today. The most obvious feature of the Sx is that it does not require investment in a dual-channel endoscope in order to gain access to the benefits of suturing. The Sx is compatible with over 20 single-channel flexible endoscopes, representing the most prevalent endoscopes in the market today across four different manufacturer platforms. Today, our U.S. OverStitch business consists of approximately 400 accounts representing about 900 users. We estimate that closer to 4,000 of the roughly 15,000 gastroenterologists in the United States have a therapeutic practice and therefore could benefit from the improved access to suturing that Sx offers. In the fourth quarter, we were conducting what we call the limited launch of Sx and we learned a lot about the nuances of attaching Sx to the various different scope platforms, using it in different tissue types and for different therapeutic needs. We will of course give you an update on how the full-launch is going at the end of our first quarter. The Sx is a new product. It will often require a review by hospitals value analysis committee or VAC prior to its purchase. The link to time the VAC process takes can vary from one facility to another. Supporting the VAC process with the first wave of target accounts is now a major part of our launch effort. 2018 was a really good year in the development of the ESG or Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty procedure. I would say that this procedure really arrived this past year. Our goal at the beginning of 2018 was to have 100 U.S. physicians offering ESG and we hit that goal. Outside the United States, there were roughly 130 physicians regularly performing ESG. Over the course of 2018, there were 12 new clinical papers published in various medical journals by physicians under ESG results. Across all these papers, there was our high degree of consistency in the results in terms of patient weight loss, comorbid disease improvement and low adverse event rates, which were also consistent with earlier complications over the past three years. To briefly highlight a recent example, on February 19, we made investors aware of the paper published in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy detailing ESG outcomes on 1,000 consecutive patients as a single Centre. These patients lost on average 64.7% of their excess body weight. In addition, these results showed a 100% remission for hypertension related comorbidities and a 70% remission for Type II diabetes with the remainder 30% of the Type II diabetic patient showing significant improvement. Importantly, no physicians required an emergency intervention and there were no mortalities conforming what we have seen previously with respect to the compelling safety profile of the ESG procedure. As we observe these days and talk with physicians there is no doubt that this procedure is attractive to both physicians and patients. And we also think ESG will be attractive to payers. The most important initiatives we have directed at building payer day here in United States market is the ongoing MERIT study, a multicenter randomized controlled trial of the ESG procedure being co-led by the Mayo Clinic and the University of Texas in Houston. The study participants consist both of bariatric surgeon sites and gastroenterology sites. The MERIT trial remains in active enrolment and our most recent update was that approximately three-fourth of the studies 200 patients have been randomized. Outside the United States, our ESG clinical initiative centers on our European bariatric registry, a multicenter, multi-country registry that kicked off back in May of 2018 with the goal to capture data on both ESG and suture based bariatric surgical revisions, and this registry of 190 patients have been enrolled so far. Our clinical data development program for OverStitch in 2019 includes other registry programs, both here in the United States and in Europe to support the broader mainstream market adoption for core GI suture applications. Our purpose for all these studies is to support increased adoption and reimbursement for both bariatric and core GI applications in the geographies that we serve. We trained 66 new physicians outside the United States on OverStitch during the fourth quarter of 2018 and another 143 in the United States through our mobile Learning Center. The majority of this training was still centered on the dual-channel OverStitch system. Similar to past quarters, we also provide educational brands to 23 different third-party sponsored physician training events worldwide that wanted to highlight the benefits of endoscopic suturing to their audiences. Now, turning to IGB. We continue to believe this product line offers great opportunities. Outside the United States, adoption of Orbera365 has remained strong in the market where it is available. Our efforts to obtain additional clearances for Orbera365 are progressing slower than we had hoped, and, in some markets, we will need to supplement our applications with additional clinical data. Of our Top 20 distributor markets, only about a third of those today currently have regulatory clearance for Orbera365. During our last earnings call, I shared my enthusiasm regarding the growing interest within the hepatology community concerning endo-bariatric therapy, such as Orbera and ESG to treat patients with fatty liver disease such as NASH. There are a large number of drug candidates in the pipeline searching for treatment for this unmet need, but most are still long ways from becoming commercially available. The connection between weight loss and improving liver disease is well established in the major hepatology societies have published guidelines for weight loss as part of their treatments.  These guidelines call for weight loss of at least 7%, preferably 10% of the patient\u2019s total body weight in order to notably improve the patient's liver function. Orbera consistently held patients achieve his 10% total body weight loss target throughout its more than 230 peer-reviewed publications. While the importance of weight loss to treat liver disease is widely known, the awareness of endoscopic weight loss options is surprisingly low, and our efforts right now are centered on improving clinician awareness. And as a result of these efforts, there will be a dedicated session at this year's International Liver Congress, what is known as ILC in April in Vienna on Endo-bariatric therapies as alternatives for NASH patients. ILC is a flagship event in the educational calendar of the European Association for the study of the liver, also known as EASL. It typically has over 10,000 attendees. This session will be the first time, this topic of endo-bariatric treatments has been on the agenda at this meeting. We believe that improving awareness in Europe and we have a solid established user base is a place for us to push forward in this initiative. Even though while our IGB revenue in the United States is less than 15% of our continuing product revenue, establishing the IGB market in the United States remains an important goal. In many respects, this weight-loss season is fundamentally the third launch of Orbera in the U.S. market. In the current cash pay environment, consumer facing marketing efforts are obviously important. And in 2018, the plastic surgery practice has emerged as the leading site of service due to their typically strong marketing and cash pay operating capabilities. About half of our new Orbera users added in 2018 were affiliated with plastic surgery practices, and plastic surgery accounts were 38% of our U.S. Orbera sales in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to only 20% in the fourth quarter of 2017. As we entered this weight-loss season, we think we have the customers and marketing programs in place to be successful. Margin improvement is something we have spoken about now for some time and in 2018 our team completed the transfer of our Cinch product and also completed a series of changes to components of our IGB system, which together are estimated to produce 2 million in cost savings based on last year's unit volumes.  This may get masked in the short-term somewhat because of the removal of our surgical product margins, but on our continuing revenue base of $41 million, 2 million in savings is roughly a 5% gross margin improvement. We have additional projects underway that when completed over the next couple of years will result in additional margin improvement on our continuing products. I will conclude now with some commentary on 2019 revenue expectations. We estimate that our endo-product sales should increase by 15% in 2019 over 2018. Residual surgical sales are excluded from the above. We will continue to report surgical sales during the length of our transition services agreements, but we have no targets or expectations to share with you on that. And this 15% that I mentioned is for the whole of 2019. We estimate endo-product sales growth will likely be lower than 15% in the first half and higher than 15% in the second half of 2019. And with that, we will open the lines for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Matt Hewitt with Craig Hallum. Your line is open. Matt Hewitt : Good morning Todd and Stefanie. Thank you for taking the questions. Todd Newton : Hi Matt, good morning. Stefanie Cavanaugh : Hi Matt. Matt Hewitt : Good morning. Maybe first on gross margins, you mentioned that you obviously started to make some changes last year to help facilitate higher gross margins of future, how should we be thinking about those in FY19 and where do you see those going maybe over the next 3 years to 5 years as some of those changes start to take effect and you see the rapid growth in the bariatric piece? Thanks. Stefanie Cavanaugh : So, thanks for the question Matt. We had announced on the surgical call, when we talk about the divestiture of the surgical business that we expect our margins in 2019 to be in the low to [mid-30%] range. That\u2019s depending upon the timing of, of course, the divestiture, the transition that occurs; depending upon our sales mix and also depending upon the timing of our gross margin improvement projects kicking in, but we have shared that with everyone and we have no exchange to that process. Over the next 3 years to 5 years, it is our intention that these gross margin projects that Todd referred to that will complete around 2020 should add another improvement in the 3 million to 3.5 million range, and that should get us into the mid-60% gross margin profile that we are now working to progress towards. Matt Hewitt : Okay. Thank you. And then you mentioned the study out of Saudi Arabia that was published in mid-February, a thousand procedure sounds like a pretty significant practice, maybe help us understand why that\u2019s such a big deal? And more importantly, how many other doctors do you have either domestically or internationally that are running that number, that size of a practice? Todd Newton : It is significant in a couple of respects and it\u2019s not necessarily \u2013 these are not necessarily data points you will put out the study, but one thing that makes it significant is that the bariatric practice at King Saud hospital is a very active practice. It\u2019s bariatric surgeon driven and the interesting thing about that study from my perspective was that as we were talking to the physician who published the results, he did not see that he or she was replacing really any of his bariatric surgical procedures, his more traditional bariatric surgical procedures. What he noted was that ESG was attractive to many of his patients who otherwise would have opted not to receive one of the other traditional bariatric surgery. So, in that regard, what made him so excited, I think, was that he saw not a replacement of one procedure for the other, but he was observing and has continued to observe that his practice overall is just growing. In other words, the pie is growing, not just the ESG sliver of the pie. Matt Hewitt : Interesting, okay. And then, maybe one last one for me and I\u2019ll hop back in the queue. Regarding the MERIT study, you\u2019re \u2013 it sounds like you\u2019re approximately three quarters all the way through the 200 being randomized. Maybe an update on what we should anticipate from a completion timeline. And then, will \u2013 do you anticipate they will get maybe a read-out shortly thereafter? Or just help us understand the timeline. Thank you. Todd Newton : Yes, and I don't have a lot of information to share with you, Matt, in terms of all the specifics on the timeline. We are hopeful though that once they reach the one-year follow-up point, and of course, they have to finish randomization in enrollment before they can get to that even, but once they get to that one-year follow-up point that \u2013 the principal investigators will elect to publish their interim results. But that's really up to them, and we don't have much, you know, if any control over that decision. Matt Hewitt : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from JP McKim with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. JP McKim : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask one on this early launch of Sx in the U.S. Maybe procedures that have been used in, is it sort of how you thought it would be? Or is there anything that\u2019s kind of jumped out of the surprising that you didn't expected to see uptick that early there? Todd Newton : No, there\u2019s really nothing to give you, JP, in terms of that kind of color. What we have found, and this is the reason why we wanted to do limited launch, we have vowed that the Sx seems to work really well in all those traditional users that the older OverStitch was being used for. And so, in that regard, we were trying to determine whether or not it had a limitation, if you will, before we went on with the launch and we\u2019re very pleased into the limited launch that we didn\u2019t see those kinds of limitations. JP McKim : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, on the kind of growth outlook in that business being stronger in the second half versus the first half, I assume that comes down to the value, the VAC committees and so, what\u2019s the \u2013 like how long does it traditionally taking you to get to the VAC? I know everyone is different, but is that the real gaining factor to your growth rate this year? Todd Newton : I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a gaining factor other than it\u2019s a timing issue here at the very front-end. You know, your right and that the VAC process isn\u2019t usually something that takes months, it\u2019s something that can take weeks. But it\u2019s also \u2013 I think what\u2019s influencing our 15% also is to do with the Intragastric Balloon business. You know, I would say that in \u2013 as we look at the first half here in 2019, we have five months of business basically that were pre or the before the FDA\u2019s third letter, and those months represent \u2013 it was just a higher comp period versus the back half of the year. So, the IGB influences our estimates as well. JP McKim : Okay. So IGB, I know you\u2019ll give it, but flat, down, up. Can you just give directionality where you think IGB overall this year? Todd Newton : Well, I think, we don't give it in \u2013 broken down by a product. Certainly not this guidance, but we think that the 15% blended is probably somewhat instructive to you JP. If we see OverStitch growing at a rate that is consistent with its historical growth, then very usually presented the Intragastric Balloon expectation is going to be lower than the 15%. JP McKim : Got you. Okay, thank you so much. Operator : Next question comes from Suraj Kalia with Northland Securities. Your line is open. Suraj Kalia : Good morning, everyone. Can you hear me alright? Todd Newton : Yes. Suraj Kalia : Okay. So, Stefanie the new debt put in place, does this have specific covenants on the revenues and cash flows? Stefanie Cavanaugh : So, our agreement does have a revenue covenant. Its set at [indiscernible] our plan for 2019, and we do have a minimum liquidity covenant or requirement to maintain $10 million of cash. Suraj Kalia : Okay, got it. And Todd, specifically on Orbera, you were not marketing Orbera for NASH, correct? I just want to make sure this is your commentary. It was more implied as a side effect, I mean, you know, a positive side effect for obesity treatment, you're not specifically marketing in NASH. Todd Newton : No, we\u2019re not claiming, if you will, if this is the question, we\u2019re not claiming that Orbera is a solution for NASH where we\u2019re \u2013 our product label is that Orbera is indicated for weight loss, and the hepatology society's own guidelines discuss weight loss as an important consideration for the treatment of NASH patients. So, if you think about that way, that\u2019s how we\u2019re positioning the product in the hepatology community. Suraj Kalia : Got it. And Todd, specifically for OverStitch, can you give us some color on the number of accounts OverStitch is being used? And you know just the sales and marketing landscape, it seems like the SG&A cost for OverStitch are high. Can you just kind of help us reconcile those two? Todd Newton : Yes, I\u2019m sorry Suraj if I get this a little bit wrong because there are \u2013 you were starting to break up. But the color on the customer base, first of all, I think we mentioned this in the script, we have about 400 accounts in the United States, and an account is not necessarily equal to a user, an account would be where we ship product. We think those 400 accounts in the United States will represent probably close to 900 users who are relatively active users today with OverStitch.  Relatively active just meaning that when they have a suturing case come up, they will look into \u2013 opt to the suture versus some of the alternatives that they have. And as we were mentioning with the niche scope that OverStitch required in the past \u2013 that was \u2013 while it hadn\u2019t changed our or effected our growth too much in those prior periods, it was going to at some point become of a limited patient to us. So, we think that the Sx is going to make the product and the technology just available to a wider number of accounts, and I mentioned 4,000 of the 15,000 gastroenterologists in the United States being potential suturing users. That's obviously not precise, but it\u2019s fairly well researched on our part, and we feel like that\u2019s a good indication of the potential user base. As far as sales and marketing for OverStitch is concerned, there\u2019s a far or less amount of spend being put on things like direct-to-consumer advertising, it\u2019s not that kind of a product. It does require a field sales support. So, the sales reps that we have, I would say, a lot of their time is spent on OverStitch, and the thing that OverStitch carries, as well as is a relatively expensive medical education component because it does take user training and that's something that is probably incrementally higher than what we see for Orbera or what we are seeing for the surgical products in the past. Suraj Kalia : Got it. And finally, Stefanie, my \u2013 forgive me, my phone was \u2013 my reception was a little bad. You mentioned \u2013 made some comments on inventory drawdown in Q4 and the impact, you know, on margins, can you repeat that again? Forgive me, I missed it. Thank you for taking my questions. Stefanie Cavanaugh : Sure Suraj, no problem. So, yes, our inventory declined this year in order \u2013 as planned. We had built up our inventory in anticipation of the transfer related to the gross margin improvement projects. So, in 2017, we ended at 10 million, which had some of that increase or most of that increase in it. Now that we've finished the Helix project, the Cinch project and the IGB project, you know, early in the fourth quarter, we were able to now bring down those inventory levels. So, when we were at about 10 million at the end of 2017, we\u2019re at about 6 million at the end of 2018 and about $3 million of that decline all occurred in the fourth quarter. And so that\u2019s a good \u2013 from that perspective that\u2019s a good trend in terms of needing to invest in increased inventory levels. But the downside or the foot side of that is at least during the fourth quarter, we had an impact on the amount of [overhead] that was charged to cost of goods sold. It\u2019s important to know that overhead spend didn\u2019t go up, it's really just the rolling out of that inventory that had been sitting on the balance sheet in anticipation of any potential disruption associated with those projects. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Matt Hewitt with Craig Hallum. Your line is open. Matt Hewitt : Yes, thank you. Just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the NASH opportunity. I guess a couple of different aspects of this. Number one, what is \u2013 how do you get this information into the hands of the physicians, the surgeons? What's the best way to attack this market, especially in light of some of the opportunities that you see out there? I mean if you look at some of the valuations of the drug companies, and these are drugs that are still in clinical development, may be years away if ever getting approved, yet you have both Balloon and ESG that have shown data that \u2013 that supports the treatment of NASH. So, you've got the data already. So, maybe just walk us through what is the way that you plan to attack that market? Thank you. Todd Newton : Matt, first of all, the most important thing we feel like we can do in the short-term is to continue to create clinician awareness, and this is why events like the ILC event that we mentioned coming up in April is important. It gives us an opportunity to be on the stage, if you will, to have some of the clinicians who have had great results with Orbera treatment for NASH patients talk about it, and create that awareness. That\u2019s the most important thing we can do right now. There's still some work we need to do in terms of things like labeling, and of course, it's probably an area where you really can't have enough clinical evidence ever. There's going to always be a little bit of a demand for more clinical evidence, so we need to do some more work there. But in the short term, we think, especially in Europe where we have a relatively established and large Intragastric Balloon user base that we can create clinician awareness at the Hepatology societies, Hepatology departments and Gastroenterology departments are fairly well aligned within most hospital structures, and just like creating that greater clinical awareness, we can have an impact on our positioning of that the Balloon for that use. Matt Hewitt : Understood. Alright, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we do not have any telephone questions at this time. I will turn the call over to the presenters. Todd Newton : Great. Well, thank you operator. And in closing, we would like to thank all of you for your interest in Apollo Endosurgery today, and should you have any questions for follow-up please contact John Gillings, our Investor Relations Manager, and his contact information is listed on our press release today. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Kenzie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome, everyone to the Apollo Endosurgery First Quarter 2019 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. John Gillings, you may begin your conference. John Gillings : Thanks, Kenzie. And thanks, everyone, for participating in today's call. Joining me on the call are Todd Newton, Chief Executive Officer; and Stefanie Cavanaugh, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include Forward-Looking Statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including Apollo's financial outlook and Apollo's plans and timing for product development and sales. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties and Apollo's actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed today May 2, 2019, with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, May 2, 2019. Except as required by law, Apollo undertakes no obligation to revise or update any statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. During this call, we will interchangeably use the terms ESS for OverStitch and the term IGB for Orbera and vice versa. In this call, we will also refer to the term continuing product revenue, which excludes the revenue associated with our Surgical products, which we divested on December 17, 2018. Continuing product revenue will differ from our GAAP revenue as we will still report historical and transitional Surgical product sales as part of our GAAP revenues. Now I would like to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Newton : Thank you, John. And good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining today's call to discuss our first quarter 2019 results. We are pleased with our product sales growth this quarter, especially for ESS. The constant currency information that we reported in our press release removes the effects of foreign exchange rate changes and provides a better understanding of our real local currency sales performance in the first quarter versus our GAAP reported revenue, which includes currency effects. Constant currency sales performance, also aligns better to what management expects from our commercial organization worldwide, that being year-over-year growth in the local currency in which our respected teams operate. In the first quarter of 2019, our Endo-bariatric product sales, which represent our continuing product sales increased 9% in constant currency. Worldwide ESS or OverStitch sales increased 17% in constant currency, and we are very pleased with this result. Of these continuing product sales in the quarter, about 60% were from markets outside the United States where our periodic sales reporting has exposure to changing foreign currency rates. In our 2018 year-end call, we said we expected our endo product sales in 2019 to grow around 15%, with a lower growth rate in the first half and higher in the second half. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen during the first quarter versus the euro, which is our largest sales currency after the U.S. dollar. We will not attempt to forecast currency rates, however, if rates were to remain at current levels, we would expect the impact of currency on our revenue growth rates to decline as the year progresses. And at this time, we see no reason to change our 2019 guidance. I will turn the call over to Stefanie now to cover our financial results in greater detail. Stefanie. Stefanie Cavanaugh : Thank you, Todd. And good afternoon, everyone. ESS sales increased 13% to $6.5 million in the first quarter of 2019 versus $5.8 million in the first quarter of 2018. On a constant currency basis, total ESS sales increased 17%. Sales in the United States increased 20% and outside the U.S., ESS sales increased 7% on an as-reported basis. And in constant currency terms OUS ESS sales increased 14%. ESS growth resulted from expanded procedure use within existing accounts and the addition of new users. Sales from OverStitch Sx contributed, but were not particularly meaningful to sales growth in the quarter. Intragastric Balloon or IGB sales were $4.3 million in the first quarter versus $4.5 million in the first quarter of last year. Sales in OUS markets were roughly 2/3 of our total IGB revenue in the first quarter. And roughly flat on an as-reported basis while up 5% on a constant currency basis when compared to the first quarter of 2018. Constant currency OUS growth was due to increased sales in Europe, where we have available the Orbera365 product, partially offset by declines in the other OUS markets, especially Brazil, where we do not yet have Orbera365. In the United States, IGB sales were down approximately $150,000 versus the first quarter of last year, more or less back to prior year level. Due to financial related issues, one of our largest customers in the first quarter of last year was unable to receive product shipments in the first quarter of this year. This single customer alone resulted in a decline this quarter of more than $200,000. Since the end of the first quarter, it appears that their issues have been resolved, and we expect shipments will resume. In total, our first quarter of 2019 continuing product revenues, which we define as our Endo-bariatric product sales after the sale of our Surgical products in the fourth quarter of 2018, those continued product revenues increased 5% as reported, to $10.8 million or 9% on a constant currency basis compared to the first quarter of 2018. Total GAAP revenues in the first quarter were $13.2 million, which included $1.7 million of Surgical product sales, compared to $15.7 million in the first quarter 2018, which included $5.2 million of Surgical product sales for a decrease of 16% or $2.5 million. Gross margin for the first quarter 2019 was 54.8% compared to 58.4% in the prior year period. The decline in gross margin was due largely to the sale of the Surgical products and the ongoing shift of revenue toward ESS sales, which carries a lower margin than our other products, partially offset by the positive impact of the 2 gross margin projects we completed last fall related to the Cinch component of OverStitch and the Orbera delivery system. The impact of the two completed projects, maybe difficult to clearly pick out as we are also continuing to transfer portions of the OUS Surgical products over the course of the year. But on our continuing revenue base exiting 2018 at $41 million, the targeted $2 million of cost savings is roughly a 5% gross margin improvement. We had a nice sequential increase from Q4 2018 margin of 46.6% to the 54.8% this quarter and the impact of these projects played a role. Margin improvement continues to be an ongoing effort as we are currently working on several projects that when completed over the next few quarters, will result an additional margin improvement for our continuing products of roughly $3.5 million, calculated using our 2018 volumes. Total operating expenses were $9.8 million for the first quarter 2019 compared to $16.8 million in the first quarter 2018. The largest contributor to this decrease in operating expense was a settlement gain related to the resolution of a dispute with Allergan regarding inventory purchases and transition services provided through 2018 [indiscernible] after our December 2013 acquisition of their obesity products business. Excluding this onetime gain, total operating expenses were $15.4 million, a decrease of 8% or roughly $1.4 million over the first quarter of 2018. This remaining decrease was mainly due to lower amortization of intangible related to the sale of the Surgical business last December. Our net loss for the first quarter of 2019 was $2.8 million compared to $8.1 million for the first quarter 2018. Excluding the settlement gain, our net loss is $8.4 million, an increase of roughly $300,000. Now, I will turn it back to Todd. Todd Newton : Thank you, Stefanie. I have several updates that I want to provide you this afternoon, starting with Sx. The Sx launch is going fine and as expected. Its selling process is very similar to the dual-channel compatible OverStitch. First, we obtain approval from a hospital or surgery center to purchase the product, which many times involves a value-analysis committee review. From then it's a medical education lift that will involve more than one touch point as we transition physicians from an introduction to the device, to a confidence level with the device and then to proficiency across a variety of procedure applications. This transition is just time in the lab and time in cases. Training is not a one-and-done effort with either our sales reps or new user. One of our strength as an organization, is that we have a great medical education team with a lot of suturing experience and a well-tested playbook on how to take a prospect from their first training through the steps to become a confident and frequent user of our technology. In addition, we have a solid field sales organization. The important thing at this point is our activity, which consist mostly of working through value-analysis committee evaluations and this pipeline looks good to us. We are confident that Sx is on target to rollout very well as this year progresses. More broadly as we think about endoscopic suturing, there are two significant market opportunities that we are focused on : Core GI use and bariatrics. There are phenomenal core GI cases being reported to us, including cases involving full-thickness resection and treating several complications that would have required surgical intervention in the past but can be addressed endoscopically because of the ability to suture. Core GI will continue to be an area were suturing is gaining momentum. But I want to discuss today our market development for our OverStitch and bariatrics, as it represents the largest potential procedure market for OverStitch, especially the ESG procedure. We have a solid user base for ESG, a large and growing body of published research that consistently shows a compelling safety and efficacy profile for the ESG procedure. In the first quarter, the journal Gastrointestinal Endoscopy or GIE, published Professor Alqahtani's report on his first 1,000 consecutive ESG procedures, which you can read about in our press release from February 19. Since then, two other ESG experiences came out. First, GIE also published a case-match study from Johns Hopkins that compared ESG with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The highlight of this study was the attention it drew to the proportion of patients that had new onset of GERD following the laparoscopic sleeve procedure, which was 14.5% versus their ESG group, which was less than 2% in a much notable lower rate of adverse events. Second, last month Professor Silvana Perretta from IRCAD in Strasbourg, France, presented an abstract at SAGES that compared matched patient quality of life after ESG and after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. They reported similar results as the Johns Hopkins GIE paper. While absolute weight loss was higher in IRCAD's laparoscopic sleeve patients, their ESG patients showed similar resolution or improvements to comorbidities, and their quality of life scores showed clear advantage for ESG. In the IRCAD study, for example, 30% of laparoscopic sleeve patients showed worsening GERD symptoms compared to 0% in the ESG patient group. The ESG procedure is no longer in a proof-of-concept stage, and we expect more clinical experiences will be published. It has the interest of many physicians and societies right now and there continues to be new interest and growing commitment from a variety of academic centers worldwide. In the first quarter, for example, we learned of two new IRB approvals for ESG study protocols that will soon start in both Oslo and Rome. On the reimbursement front, there are 2 ESG coverage efforts outside the United States that we have high expectations for, prior to the end of the year. In Australia, we filed an ESG application with the Medical Services Advisory Committee or MSAC for patients with Class I or Class II obesity and comorbidities who have failed their first-line treatments for weight loss. The MSAC is a body that advises the Australian government on coverage adoption of new medical technologies and procedures. The MSAC process includes 4 stages, we are currently through the first two stages, we anticipate clearing the next stage in October with the potential for a final MSAC decision before the end of 2019. There were approximately 24,000 bariatric procedures performed in Australia last year. In Germany, a procedure or OPS code was first granted in late 2017 for endoscopic plication using endoscopy but without the assignment of funds. In 2018, we were successful in obtaining an initial funding level for this OPS code. In Q1 of this year, we made a further application for additional funding with input from key users in Germany. We expect to have feedback on this latest funding application in Q4 this year. In the United States, we are on a traditional pathway for ESG with our most important reimbursement activity centered on the MERIT study, a multicenter randomized controlled trial for ESG being co-led by the Mayo Clinic and University of Texas, in Houston. In Rome, it slowed at the end of 2018 and early 2019 and currently stands with about 170 of the 200 patients having been screened and randomized. Lastly more than 240 patient cases have been reported to date in the European bariatric registry. This registry is intended to capture both ESG and bariatric surgical revision patient data. We expect the first abstract of data from this bariatric registry to be presented at DDW, later this month. Turning now to our Intragastric Balloon activity. We think our first quarter efforts have positioned this product for a return to growth as this year progresses. Here in the United States market, our sales and marketing team has returned our U.S. IGB sales to the approximate same level as in Q1 of last year. And it's also a healthier business compared to this time last year in many respects. For one, the efficiency of our patient education or promotional spend has improved, as our U.S. promotional spend per U.S. dollar sold decreased by 20%. As you would expect, the market disruptions of the past couple of years resulted in some customer turnover but our U.S. sales are less dependent now on any single customer or set of customers. In Q1 of last year, the top 10 customer locations were over 1/3 of our total U.S. Orbera sales, this year the top 10 represent only a quarter of Orbera sales. Our sales organization has done a really good job remaining focused through the disruption and today, we have a wider customer base, less customer concentration and a greater proportion of our customers have solid cash pay operations. It's nice to have a sales force. In Q1, our sales team was also actively engaged in efforts to transition former ReShape Intragastric Balloon accounts to Orbera. As part of our Surgical product divestiture in late 2018, we acquired the ReShape Balloon product and probably discontinued its sale as of the end of 2018. So in Q1, we offered a product exchange program for legacy ReShape accounts, In addition to an inventory exchange, this program offered these accounts the ability to complete a smooth transition to Orbera, including training on the Orbera procedure for their physicians and their staff and access to consumer marketing and education content. A total of 44 former ReShape Intragastric Balloon customers elected to participate in this special program. The program did not result in significant product sales in Q1 though these accounts may represent promising Orbera accounts going forward. Also relevant to our U.S. Intragastric Balloon business, we have made excellent progress towards the completion of our FDA-required Orbera post approval study. This past week the last enrolled-patients balloon was explanted, which concluded the study's Patient Treatment Stage. The only effort remaining is the post-balloon 6-month follow-up period. We are therefore on target for this study to wrap up by the end of this calendar year. Outside of the United States, Orbera365 sales were satisfactory in the markets where it was available. Of our top 20 distributor markets, only about 1/3 currently have a regulatory clearance for Orbera365, and this represents a significant opportunity for us in the future. In April, we also participated in the International Liver Congress for the first time. Our main goal at the Congress was to expand awareness in the hepatic community about Endo-bariatric therapies. The Congress include the first ever meet-the-expert session focused on the benefits of endoscopic weight loss therapy as an effective treatment option for patients with fatty liver disease. Fatty liver disease is an ideal target area for Orbera for a couple of reasons. First, lifestyle modifications targeting 7% to 10% weight loss is the current recommended treatment for histological improvement of fatty liver disease. And second, Orbera consistently facilitates patient weight loss in excess of 10%. We will have more on this to report to you in future updates as our plans in this area develop. To recap, we have exciting opportunities we are pursuing. For OverStitch, we are launching Sx to bring suturing to places where it has not been accessible before. We are pursuing clinical data and reimbursement for the ESG procedure and think there could be news on some of our reimbursement efforts outside the United States later this year. And of course, we continue to support exciting core GI use of OverStitch. For Orbera, we are in the midst of a solid recovery effort in the U.S. market. We are pursuing new Orbera365 market clearances outside of the United States, and we are actively developing plans for the treatment of patients with NASH and other weight-related comorbidities. And we are on target to bring our FDA-mandated post approval obligation for Orbera to a successful close later this year. Furthermore, as Stef already updated you, also on our ongoing margin-improvement initiatives. The last matter I would like to discuss is what is next on the product development front for us. We continue to invest in new product development. We have been on a journey to make suturing with a flexible endoscope more broadly available. First was OverStitch, which successfully conquered the longstanding clinician desire to suture with a flexible endoscope but has limited scope compatibility. This year, we are introducing OverStitch Sx, which expands the capability to suture to include over 20 single-channel endoscopes across 4 different manufacturer platforms, including the leading endoscopes available in the market today. Our next new product objective is to make flexible endoscopic suturing compatible with the colonoscope. Suturing with a flexible endoscope is highly disruptive to traditional management of colorectal disease. The lower GI tract represents a sizable and addressable market opportunity, with the potential to increase a number of colorectal procedures that can be safely completed entirely endoluminally. This is what is next for us, and we have some very interesting working concepts already, and we look forward to updating you as we proceed through our product development stages. Finally, we are quickly approaching DDW or Digestive Disease Week, which is the most significant conference of the year for us. And we look forward to seeing you -- some of you there. Demand for suturing courses and training opportunities will be high. There are 4 suture courses being posted by DDW, in addition to the opportunities we will provide during DDW in our Mobile Learning Center. And with that, we will now open the lines up for questions. Operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum. Matt Hewitt : A couple of questions. First, regarding OverStitch and Sx in particular, are there any metrics that you can provide and maybe the number of doctors that you have trained to date or number of facilities, or [indiscernible] that you have gotten through? Any color along those lines? Todd Newton : No. We don't have any metrics for you today other than what we said, which was we feel very good about the pipeline of activity where we are currently engaged in the value-analysis committee answers. Matt Hewitt : Okay. And shifting gears quick to Orbera. Obviously, there has been some disruption. I hear recently one of your competitors, and I realize it's pretty early, but I'm wondering if you have seen any benefit from them going indirect and obviously, you having the direct sales force. Anything along those lines? Todd Newton : Yes. We feel very optimistic about where we are heading into Q2 with Orbera. We feel like we have put in place a lot of good things here in the last couple of quarters to position us well. And as it relates specifically to any competitor situation, I don't really have any comments for you in that regard. And I wouldn't probably be able to attribute anything that we are seeing within our business to a competitive situation anyway. We just feel like we are making good progress, and we are happy with that. Matt Hewitt : Okay. And maybe one last one and then I will hop back into queue. And this is more of a big-picture question. It seems like almost every single day, there is a headline, an article, some new data that is pointing to the benefits of treating obesity. Whether it be due to the number of cancers that are being attributed to obesity or some of the other issues that come from having a high BMI, yet, it appears that we are not quite seeing the wheels turn on the reimbursement front maybe as fast as you would expect or would hope. And I'm just curious your take on, what do you think is going to be the trigger? What is going to finally wake the health care community up that this is something that needs to be addressed to reduce health care costs. I mean that seems to be a big as we enter the election cycle, that is a big issue - is reducing health care costs. Well here is, in my opinion, a slam-dunk opportunity, yet, it doesn't seem that the gears are moving quite as fast. What are your thoughts and what do you think it's going to take? Todd Newton : Yes, that is a great question, Matt, and one that I probably will not have a really perfect answer for this afternoon. It's obviously an area where health economic data is critical. We know on the clinician side, we know on the patient's side. For example, there has a great deal of interest on ESG but payers still need to see data that they need to see and they need to see it in a fashion that helps them understand that there is a cost benefit to offering a procedure like the ESG. And I think that is common for any type of area within medicine today. There needs to be a cost benefit because it is with the rising cost of health care, it oftentimes appears to be a zero-sum game as to how many dollars do payers have to, let's call it, cover different procedures with. So you do need to be able to demonstrate that by addressing any disease that it actually is cost beneficial to do so. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of JP McKim with Piper Jaffray. Andrew Stafford : This is Drew on for JP. And congrats on the nice quarter. I want to say on Sx here, too, and thanks for providing that early feedback. It sounds like the U.S. is starting really nice. They are obviously, pretty early in your launch here. Kind of as we try to get a feel for the rollout. We are just curious though, what mix are you seeing between Sx and Gen 1 today. And kind of how do you see that trending throughout the year? And then sort of to piggyback on that as well. Does that have a margin impact for the company given where Q1 took out? Todd Newton : Yes. Good question. So first of all on the mix here in Q1. Keep in mind, I think it's important to remember that the Sx launch began in February. So in relation to the quarter that we are talking about, even though it's now, 1st - 2nd May, I should say, that is still relatively short period of time that Sx was in the market as it relates to Q1. With respect to Q1, most of our OverStitch sales or ESS sales were still the dual-channel version of OverStitch by far. So we did have sales of Sx in the first quarter, but I would not say that Sx was a big contributor to our growth rates in Q1, that was still the traditional OverStitch product. And when it comes to the, If you will, the rollout later this year, we expect that to, obviously, change. And as we get through value-analysis committees, we have every expectation that we will begin to see orders for product and then with our training, which we feel very good about, our training skills, medical education skills. We are going to turn a lot of those accounts into very proficient users of OverStitch, and so we are excited about that. But it's going to be one of those rollouts that simply is an execution story where we do in fact have to execute. And now on the margin side, I think I will turn that over to Stef to talk about. Stefanie Cavanaugh : Well, I think the question was, is there a margin impact between dual-channel and single-channel OverStitch? And the answer to that is, it's basically the same. There has a slight difference but the bigger issue to our margin is that OverStitch as a whole, both dual-channel and single-channel is lower margin than our other products. And therefore, we have our gross margin improvement projects that we are working on to improve that process or that profile, regardless of whether it's single-channel or dual-channel. Andrew Stafford : Okay, that is very helpful. And I just want to follow-up one more. I guess, you just mentioned right there in your opening remarks about your progress with your value-analysis committees. I'm like, how long is that process kind of taking from start to finish? And sort of what are they pushing back on the most? Todd Newton : Yes. And just to take the second part, I'm not aware of really a lot of push back that I'm hearing about. The value-analysis committee efforts depend a lot upon the specific hospital, depend a lot on the specific ASC. Yes, it depends a lot upon just when they can get those people together and also depends a little bit about the sponsoring department and how that sponsoring department - how hard that sponsoring department, I should say, wants to push. So the factors are probably just site specific and hard to really give you a feel for. In some cases, it goes really fast and in other cases, they can just simply drag on for a variety of reasons, including just peer scheduling reasons. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back to our presenters. Todd Newton : Well, thank you, Kenzie. In closing, we just want to thank you for your interest in Apollo Endosurgery today. And if you do have any questions for follow-up, please feel free to contact John Gillings, our Investor Relations Manager. Tap the numbers that were listed on our press release earlier today.

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Newton : Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call to discuss our second quarter 2019 results. This quarter is only our second quarterly report since the sale of our surgical product line in December of last year, which was done to focus the company on the opportunities for our therapeutic endoscopy products, while also monetizing a nonstrategic asset. The second quarter was a great quarter for OverStitch, or ESS, on many levels. OverStitch sales increased in constant currency by 43%. Digestive Disease Week, which is the most significant GI conference of the year, was an incredible event for Apollo, with more than 40% clinical presentations that described the results for the use of our endo products, including over 30 papers related to procedures that relied on the use of our OverStitch endoscopic suturing system and other presentations providing clinical updates regarding Orbera experiences. Further, DDW represented a significant training event for physicians from various geographies around the world, who have heard about OverStitch and wanted to learn more. DDW itself offered four training events that included endoscopic suturing and, of course, since OverStitch is the only full-thickness endoscopic suturing system available, these sessions featured the OverStitch device. In addition, we had our mobile learning center on site to allow physicians to spend individual lab time to be introduced to our endo products or further develop their experience with our devices. As could be seen at DDW, there is tremendous physician interest to develop and adopt endoluminal approaches to treat a broad range of gastrointestinal disease and defects. Our previous product sales guidance for our endo products for 2019 was to grow around 15%. At this time, we are maintaining this stated guidance. I'll turn the call over to Stefanie now to cover our financial results in greater detail. And then, I'll come back with an operational update afterwards. Stef? Stefanie Cavanaugh : Thank you, Todd, and good afternoon, everyone. ESS sales increased 40% to $7.7 million in the second quarter of 2019, versus $5.5 million in the second quarter of 2018. On a constant currency basis, total ESS sales increased 43%. Sales in the United States increased 42% and outside the U.S. ESS sales increased 38% on an as-reported basis. In constant currency terms, OUS ESS sales increased 44%. ESS growth resulted from expanded procedure use by existing customers and the addition of new users. Sales from OverStitch Sx contributed, but the dual-channel device was the primary contributor to second quarter growth. Intragastric Balloon, or IGB, sales were $4.5 million in the second quarter versus $5.3 million in the second quarter of last year. Sales in OUS markets were roughly two-third of our total IGB revenue in the second quarter and declined 15% on an as-reported basis and 12% on a constant currency basis compared to the second quarter of 2018. We continue to see stable sales in OUS markets where Orbera365 is available being offset by lower sales in markets selling our six months balloon and thus we remain active with efforts to gain clearance for Orbera365 in these markets. On a constant currency basis, IGB sales in our direct markets were essentially flat in Q2 compared to the prior year, while distributor sales were down, primarily due to lower orders from our Middle East distributor this quarter, which we believe is a timing effect. In the United States, IGB sales were down approximately $200,000 versus the second quarter of last year due to weakness in the cash pay market for intragastric balloon treatment in the U.S. In total, our second quarter 2019 continuing product revenue defined as our Endo-bariatric product sales following the divestment of our surgical products in the fourth quarter of 2019 increased 13% as reported to $12.2 million or 16% on a constant currency basis compared to the second quarter of 2018. Total GAAP revenues in the second quarter of 2019 were $14.3 million, which included $1.3 million of surgical product sales and $0.6 million of surgical transition charges compared to $15.8 million in the second quarter 2018, which included $4.7 million of surgical product sales for a decrease of 10% or $1.5 million. Gross margins for the second quarter 2019 was 50.3% compared to 58.2% in the prior-year period. The decline in gross margin was due largely to the shift of revenue to ESS sales, which carries a lower margin than our other products, partially offset by the positive impact of the two gross margin improvement projects we completed last fall. Gross margin for our Endo-bariatric products was 50% for the second quarters of both 2019 and 2018. In addition to the impact of increasing mix to greater ESS sales, the reduction in gross margin from the first quarter to the second quarter of 2019 was due to completing the transition of surgical product sales to ReShape in certain OUS markets during the quarter, and a greater proportion of OUS surgical product sales are at a distributor sales price that previously would have been sold at end-user price. Our guidance for 2019 has been that our consolidated gross margin will be in the low to mid-50% range and at this time, we are maintaining this stated guidance. Margin improvement continues to be a focus for us as we have several projects underway. We will continue to update you on our progress. Total operating expenses were $14.4 million for the second quarter 2019 compared to $16.7 million in the second quarter 2018. This decrease was mainly due to lower amortization of intangibles related to the sale of surgical business last December of $1.3 million along with reduced sales and marketing expense of $700,000, primarily due to lower advertising spend related to U.S. IGB sales. Our net loss for the second quarter of 2019 was $8.8 million compared to $9.5 million for the second quarter of 2018 and we ended the second quarter with $23.9 million of cash, restricted cash and cash equivalents. I will now turn it back to Todd. Todd Newton : Thank you, Stefanie. To start, we're feeling very good about the health and opportunity in front of us for our ESS products. In the second quarter, the majority of our sales growth came from our dual-channel product where we have a solid and experienced user group who have invested in dual-channel scopes and continue to expand their suturing use across a number of critical applications. For the second quarter, 90% of OverStitch handle sales were dual channel and 10% were the Sx. The second quarter was the first full quarter of the Sx introduction and we are taking a deliberate and measured approach in its launch. There are many variables related to Sx including the best way to mount the product on the variety of single-channel scope platforms in the market all of which have something unique about them. There are technique pearls to learn and then share related to use of the device optimally in its various clinical settings which range from esophageal stent fixation to gastroplasty. There are various angles of scope retroflexion to address in various tissue types. And of course we are constantly finding tweaks to technique and product that can further improve the user experience. Because of this variety Sx has additional technical needs compared to the dual-channel OverStitch. And as we have mentioned many times to investors, OverStitch adoption is the result of good medical education execution and repetition to build up a physician's confidence. But once this confidence is built, as our experience with the dual-channel OverStitch shows and as DDW this year shows, it is a sticky product and those users find more and more clinical needs for the device in their practice. So our plan for Sx will continue to be a deliberate and measured rollout, which means moving physicians through our medical education program at the right pace for each individual. Basically this is the same playbook we have used the past for the dual-channel device's introduction and adoption and we expect to see solid growth throughout the balance of 2019 from both the dual and single-channel OverStitch devices. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, DDW, which took place in May, was a very positive meeting. The level of enthusiasm from physicians for the adoption of endoluminal techniques which are enabled by OverStitch to address a wide range of patient needs was evidenced by more than 30 abstracts at DDW related to procedures involving the product. This is an impressive showing for a single company in this type of setting, much less a single product. The uses described include applications in both the upper and lower GI tract, revisions of failing bariatric surgeries, suture-based endoluminal surgical treatment for reflux patients, and papers on the ESG procedure including one that presented one center's five-year patient follow-up data. In summary, it was just a stellar event. As for our press release to investors on June 24th, this quarter the MERIT trial's principal investigators informed us that enrollment in the MERIT trial was completed. As a reminder, this is the first prospective randomized controlled trial involving the ESG procedure. The 80-patient initial treatment arm is to be followed for two years and the 120 patient control group can potentially cross over for ESG treatment after one year. Since that time, the study's principal investigators have informed us of communications from the FDA that the MERIT trial needs some investigational device exemption, or IDE. The co-principal investigators continue to believe an IDE is not necessary, but have decided submitting for an IDE is the quickest path forward. And while it is pending approval MERIT procedures which are mostly crossovers at this point will be delayed. The PIs or principal investigators believe this is an administrative matter and not related to any patient safety issues in the study and do not expect a long delay. In the meantime, patient follow-up is continuing at all sites in accordance with the study's protocol. In other key ESS clinical programs, the AGA registry which is intended to capture data on core GI procedures and bariatric revisions using suturing now have over nine sites contracted and 77 patients enrolled. In Europe, the bariatric registry that began in May of last year to capture data on ESG and bariatric surgery revisions has over 240 patients enrolled. And the European GI registry we announced last September to build awareness in data of core GI users of OverStitch in Europe where core GI experience is lower than it is here in the U.S. now has more than 110 cases recorded. In addition, last quarter, we discussed ongoing ESG reimbursement efforts in important markets outside the United States and we continue to expect news from these prior to year-end. On our Intragastric Balloon activity, Stef discussed sales in the second quarter in her comments and I have a couple of additional comments to add. The way we break down our revenue in periodic reporting, which is by product and by geography, can at times put the wrong emphasis on our results. This quarter this happens to be the case because of the timing of Intragastric Balloon sales to our Middle East distributor. But to be very clear we are very pleased with our distributor market sales performance in the quarter as Endo product sales grew 42% over the prior year. We are delighted to have launched Sx in Hong Kong and to have gained Orbera365 approval in Kuwait. We have built a very strong user base with our OverStitch platform in the Middle East where we have quadrupled our sales over the prior year. But there are challenges in some of these markets from low-cost Intragastric Balloon competitors and in some these cash pay markets there is physician and patient preference or ESG over a balloon treatment, which can also lower IGB demand. As we gain get approvals for Orbera365 though, we are confident that it can offer a good value proposition to patients to help them lose and continue to maintain weight loss. Another highlight from our distributor markets this quarter is the start of normal OverStitch distribution in India, a country with a population of roughly 1.3 billion. We already have three centers of excellence in Indore, Mumbai and Hyderabad and many more accounts using our technology in this promising market. So, getting back to our IGB progress this quarter. Strategically, we believe and have a stated for some time that we believe there are two markets for ORBERA : first, the aesthetic weight loss market, which is the market we have today, especially here in the United States; and second, a medical market, which is very attractive, but needs some market development effort. Sometimes our medical use market development efforts are hard to see, especially from the outside and we often talk about our efforts and objectives, but it is difficult sometimes to see the tangible evidence of progress. During the second quarter, there were some very tangible developments that we wanted to share on this call. In June, we announced a U.S. labeling update on ORBERA that clarifies the contraindication that was previously very loosely referenced as hepatic insufficiency or cirrhosis. The new updated labeling is much more specific and clarifies that the contraindication does not apply to the pre-cirrhotic NASH patient with fibrosis. Still it is important for you to know that ORBERA is not that indicated for the treatment of NASH either. However, ORBERA is of course indicated for weight loss and weight loss is identified by the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease or the AASLD in their patient treatment guidelines as one of the most effective treatments to stop and potentially reverse the progression of fatty liver disease. Second, we were notified that an application for a level one CPT code for intragastric balloons was submitted under the joint sponsorship of the American Gastroenterology Association or AGA; American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy or ASGE; American College of Gastroenterology or ACG; the American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery; and the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons or SAGES. This joint filing for a level one CPT code reflects a remarkable consensus between the GI and surgeon communities in support of IGB therapy and the strength of our clinical data. It is our hope that the IGB application will be on the agenda for the CPT editorial panel that is scheduled to meet in late September. We understand that the agenda for this meeting should be posted on the American Medical Association's website by the end of this week. Third, CMS or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has had a national non-coverage decision related to intragastric balloon therapy that dates all the way back to the 1980s and the Garren-Edwards Gastric Bubble which was later pulled from the U.S. market. We recently met with CMS and have a mutually agreed on a plan for reevaluating this long-standing national non-coverage decision. Lastly, two separate the investigator-initiated studies began enrolling in the second quarter here in the United States for the use of ORBERA for medical purposes. Within Kaiser at the Downey location a pilot study underway to compare patients treated with ORBERA to patients in their medically-managed weight loss program. The specific idea being to understand whether ORBERA would be a better pre-op treatment for obese patients who need to lose weight to better prepare them for success from another general surgery that they are in need of. At the VA in San Diego, they were also studying the pre-op impact of ORBERA on patients who are in need of a total knee replacement, but have too high of a BMI to otherwise be considered high-success candidates for a knee replacement. Each of these developments are very important building blocks, or examples of our medical market efforts for ORBERA. To recap, it was a very good commercial quarter for endo products and in particular for OverStitch and highly productive for our market development efforts and other activity streams to build out critical clinical data and drive greater market access for our products. And with that, we'll now open the line for questions. Operator, please proceed. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Matt Hewitt from Craig-Hallum Capital. Your line is open. Matt Hewitt : Thank you for taking the questions and for the update. The first one a very strong quarter for OverStitch, and I'm curious how much of that can you attribute to just the growth that you've been seeing versus how much of that could you attribute to maybe the strong training experience that you had at DDW, or do you see DDW as kind of a springboard for Q3 in the second half of the year? Todd Newton : All right, Matt. Good to talk to you. So I think most of our growth this quarter really relates to people, who have been using OverStitch and had been introduced to OverStitch for some time. As I was mentioning in my prepared remarks, we have found and we found this over now several quarters that the medical education execution just requires that we continue to bring users along at their pace. But once they do reach that point, where they feel comfortable and confident in the product. They'd see all the different uses that they can \u2013 that have for the product within their practice. So, I do think we would attribute really very much of the OverStitch growth here in Q2 to training events at DDW itself. I think we would view this as being a reflection of things that have been work in medical education in particular that we been executing on now for the last many quarters. Matt Hewitt : That's great. And then \u2013 so the doctors and the physicians that you are training and were training at DDW and since then with the Mobile Learning Center. Maybe walk through what is the process? Do they go back talk to their hospital the purchasing groups within the hospital need to reach out to you? What is that process? How quickly does that move? And how can that be a driver over the remainder of this year and going forward? Todd Newton : Yeah. So, basically, I would \u2013 I guess characterize or walk you through it this way. Typically, we would want to see that a physician has had some level of conversation with their hospital prior to the medical education that they receive for OverStitch. DDW is somewhat unique, because it's a big GI congress and they're going to have their own programs that will include suturing. So that's a little bit unique in that regard. But in a typical Apollo-sponsored training course, we would for example want there to have already been some level of engagement at the hospital level so that we know that that particular trainee is a near-term viable user for OverStitch. So that would \u2013 that makes DDW a little bit unusual in that regard. And then, it's just a matter of taking them through the steps and getting them comfortable with how to attach it to the scope and of course use the device in a variety of different ways. Matt Hewitt : Okay. Maybe a couple of questions about ORBERA and then I'll hop back in the queue. Regarding the 365 approval you mentioned that you do anticipate possibly some more approvals by the end of the year. Are these \u2013 maybe if you could describe some of the markets where you see that as a possibility are those decent-sized markets? And how quickly once you have that 365 approved there do you anticipate that product ramping? And then, I guess, the last question on ORBERA, you just provided some details on the Kaiser and VA studies. Maybe a little bit more color as far as number of patients and when we might expect to see some data out of those two studies? Thank you. Todd Newton : Yes. And just on the first one first Matt. ORBERA365. We don't really have any specific country that we want to talk about so much today. But in general, we have a goal in markets, which do not have ORBERA365, but do have Orbera to expand the access for the 365 products. So it's just an ongoing goal that we're working on all the time. And each market has a different pace, at which those things proceed. Stefanie Cavanaugh : Kaiser and VA and when can I get some report. Todd Newton : I'm not sure that the -- I would not characterize these as big studies. I think they are more rightfully characterized as pilot studies that both institutions are interested to evaluate how Orbera works within their patient population. But I don't think they are big studies. Certainly based upon the grant request that the two institutions have sent to us, no indication that they are big studies. And I don't have any information as to what they're publishing strategy per se might be or whether they will just use the information purely internally. Operator : Your next question comes from JP McKim from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. JP McKim : Hi, good afternoon. Congratulations on the good quarter. I was -- the OverStitch growth was great. I wanted to touch on that. To think I was most surprised by how much was just the legacy OverStitch and the Sx being normally 10% of that growth, so maybe or 10% of that business. So can you just touch on that? Like are the sales reps still focusing on accounts that have the dual-channel scopes, or I don't know maybe just talk about that because that really jumped out to me. Todd Newton : Yeah, there's definitely a focus on the Sx from the standpoint of introducing it in new accounts. With that said, we've been now continuing to see really good OverStitch sales results over the course of the last several quarters and this quarter was a continuation of that, which is all about the user continuing to see the product is adding value to their practice and finding more and more applications for its use. And I think that has been what we've always seen with OverStitch. As the doctor gets comfortable with it they run into situations in their clinical practice where suturing makes sense and so we just see that evolve. And that's really also a reflection of what we saw in the abstracts from DDW. There was just very broad range of procedures that were being addressed in those abstracts and it's just very satisfying for us. Of course, OverStitch is a general use tool and we would like to see it being used generally and that's exactly what we saw this quarter as well. But the emphasis at the sales level is always going to be continue to support old customers but also, of course, try to drive new introduction at those locations where they have not made the investment in the dual-channel endoscope. And of course that's the whole purpose of Sx. JP McKim : Is it fair to say, I mean the bulk of the growth in OverStitch came from existing customers and to your point they're learning where they can use the suture technology on more and more procedures as they get comfortable with it? Todd Newton : Yeah. I think that's exactly right JP. JP McKim : Okay. And then just on Sx. It's definitely still from your comment still a measured rollout and you're learning a ton as you do so. When do you feel like you'll have the confidence you need to do a more just aggressive broader push on that product, given all the learning that you have thus far and you're getting the training perfected? Todd Newton : Yeah, I think it really is a function of confidence and building confidence and for different people and sometimes this isn't really at all tied to the individual from a skill perspective, just what kind of time that they have to dedicate to learning about new product variants. So we just continue to try to be persistent with our training and persistent with assisting the physician to get -- to gaining confidence and getting comfortable. Sometimes that involves making available for the doctors some kind of proctoring, so he can learn from another physician who is actually very experienced with the device and that's a scheduling issue. Sometimes it's something that our sales rep can just bring along themselves. So it just varies case-by-case. And that's why we emphasize that the roll-out will continue to be deliberate because that's just our reality. It will be deliberate because of the nature of the physician community that we're targeting. JP McKim : Got it. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities. Your line is open. Suraj Kalia : Good afternoon, everyone. Can you hear me all right? Todd Newton : Yes, we can hear you just fine, Suraj. Suraj Kalia : Great. So Todd, a bunch of questions. Maybe you can help clarify this. If today, obviously OverStitch growth looked very good in the quarter. If I were to draw a pie chart today for OverStitch, what would the usage look like in terms of different categories? And primarily, I'm talking about the U.S. Todd Newton : If in the U.S., I think what you would see is you'd see primarily a 50-50 to 60-40 usage split between core GI use, which would be the larger proportion and bariatric use. And the bariatric use would be both for gastroplasty or ESG and it would be for bariatric revisions and endoscopic bariatric revisions. And so within that bariatric category it would be mostly split 50-50. So hopefully that's instructive. Somewhere between 50% to 60% what we call core GI uses and somewhere between 40% and 50% which would be the broad category of bariatric use. Suraj Kalia : Got it. And was price a component of growth? I presume it would be a minuscule portion. But nonetheless how does OverStitch stand on pricing? And at the same time Todd can you give us some color on account utilization metrics in the U.S.? How should we think about it? The last I remember at least we had in our models like close to 300 -- a little over 300 accounts. But I confess it seems stale right now that number. Any color to help us better model OverStitch especially the U.S. would be greatly appreciated. Todd Newton : Yes. Just taking your first question on pricing, Suraj. This year, we did not have a price increase per se for OverStitch. We are rolling out the Sx at a price premium compared to the dual-channel version. But I think our economic rationale for doing that is that new accounts who want to adopt OverStitch are not required with Sx to purchase the piece of capital equipment i.e. the dual-channel scope, and therefore there's a justification for a slight pricing premium on Sx. But, this year was not a price increase year across the board from our stated pricing tables. And as it relates to utilization metrics, we're about the same as where we have been in terms of those metrics. We have roughly 300 accounts that we would consider to be our most active accounts. They are probably growing in two ways both in terms of their utilization but also in terms of their user base, because if we take a given hospital or we take a given clinic, it's typically not just a single physician within that clinic that is in the clinical practice. And what our experience has been is that even though OverStitch may come into a clinic or come into a hospital because of a particular physician's interests, it soon begins to become a part of the practice more generally and there's more users within that hospital setting that begin to be OverStitch users. So, the account metric is probably roughly about the same, a little bit maybe different from when we last talked about it, but let's say roughly these 300 accounts. But definitely we think that within those accounts we're seeing more physicians and of course more utilization. Suraj Kalia : Two quick questions Todd, then I'll jump back in queue. First, I'd love to get your high-level thoughts on the IGB space, and especially one of your competitors going down a brick-and-mortar route. I'd love to get that. Also, if there was any pull-through from the ReShape client base. And more specifically on OverStitch, I know Stefanie mentioned about some internal programs for improving manufacturing efficiencies. The math seems to suggest OverStitch gross margins are give or -- on a standalone basis give or take 45%, 46%. Where can that eventually land up? Just kind of walk us through in how we can get some OpEx leverage in the model. Thank you for taking my questions. Todd Newton : Yeah, you bet. So I'm going to let Stef here in a second address the gross margin and OpEx question. But as it relates to competitors, I'll just be very quick and just say, I appreciate the invite to speak about competitor strategies, but I'm going to elect not to do so today. So with that, I'm going to transfer to you Stef. Stefanie Cavanaugh : Okay. Very good. So for OverStitch gross margin, as we have shared, we completed a couple of projects in late 2018 that are helping improve our margin, actually for both the balloon and for OverStitch each -- one project each. We have several projects that we're working on now that are in various stages of completion and will complete over the next several quarters that are primarily focused on OverStitch, that will continue to get at improving the margin for that project or that product in particular. And I think, we have shared that once completed, we expect the annual benefit from all of these projects to improve our cost by $3.5 million on an annual basis using 2018 sales level, volumes, if that helps you get at that. And then on operating expense leverage, we think that we're in a pretty good position where we are with the size of our own operation and with our operating expenses to support our growth for the foreseeable future. Suraj Kalia : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have no further questions. I'll turn the call back over to Todd Newton, CEO for closing remarks. Todd Newton : Well, thank you, operator. And in closing, we just want to thank you for your interest in Apollo Endosurgery today. Should you have any questions or need for a follow-up, please contact John Gillings, our Investor Relations Manager who is listed on our press release today. Thank you again. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Matt Kreps, Investor Relations, Darrow Associates. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. Matt Kreps : Thanks, operator, and thanks, everyone, for participating in today's call to discuss Apollo's third quarter financial and operating results. Joining me on the call are Todd Newton, Chief Executive Officer; and Stefanie Cavanaugh, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including Apollo's financial outlook and Apollo's plans and timing for product development and sales. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties, and Apollo's actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the 3-month period ending September 30, 2019, filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information and is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, October 30, 2019. Except as required by law, Apollo undertakes no obligation to revise or update any statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. During this call, we will interchangeably use the term ESS for OverStitch and the term IGB for Orbera and vice versa. In this call, we'll also refer to the term continuing product revenue, which excludes the revenues associated with our surgical products, which we divested on December 17, 2018. Continuing product revenue will differ from our GAAP revenue as we'll still report historical and traditional surgical product sales as a part of our GAAP revenues. A reconciliation of this and any other adjustments to the company's GAAP operating results can be found in our Form 10-Q filed today. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Newton : Thank you, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call to discuss our third quarter 2019 results. The third quarter continued our trend of year-over-year sales growth in our continuing endoscopy product lines that are focused on the high-growth opportunities represented by the expanding field of therapeutic endoscopy. We also made progress on our programs to improve our gross -- our future gross margins and strengthen our balance sheet with the support of investors who share our belief that endoluminal surgery represents a promising and expanding new med tech market. The third quarter was another great quarter for OverStitch, our Endoscopic Suturing System or ESS. Total sales for this product line increased in constant currency terms by 30%. U.S. sales increased at an accelerated rate of 48%. In medical education, which has been core to our OverStitch commercial success, we were very busy this quarter. We supported major physician society request in connection with the world, if so, Congress held in Madrid and the ASGE's Star Certification program. And through these third-party sponsored events and our own activities, we supported introductory or advanced OverStitch training to approximately 300 positions in the third quarter. Solid progress also continued to be made on the various clinical studies we are supporting, such as the MERIT trial, our various suture registry programs and other investigator-led research. These and other activities continued to document the tremendous physician interest to develop and adopt endoluminal approaches to treat a broad range of gastrointestinal disease and defects, including, of course, obesity. I'll turn the call over to Stefanie now to cover our financial results in greater detail and then come back with an operational update. Stef? Stefanie Cavanaugh : Thank you, Todd, and good afternoon, everyone. As Todd mentioned, our business is now focused on therapeutic endoscopy, where we have 2 key product lines, ESS and IGB. Beginning with ESS, our sales increased 28% on a consolidated basis to $6.7 million in the third quarter of 2019 versus $5.2 million in the third quarter of 2018. On a constant currency basis, total ESS sales increased 30%. Sales in the United States increased 48%, and outside the U.S., ESS sales increased 9% on an as-reported basis and 12% on a constant currency basis. The ESS growth continues to be driven by expanded procedure used by existing customers and the addition of new users. Sales from OverStitch Sx contributed to the quarter, but our dual-channel device remained the primary contributor to ESS sales in the quarter. Intragastric Balloon or IGB sales were $3.7 million in the third quarter versus $4.1 million in the third quarter of last year, a decline of 9%. Though U.S. markets remain the source of the majority of our total IGB revenue in the third quarter, and OUS sales declined 9% on an as-reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis compared to the third quarter of 2018. OUS IGB sales were primarily affected by lower sales in Brazil and Spain, two markets that are primarily focused on cash pay aesthetic-focused procedures. In the United States, IGB sales were down less than $100,000 versus the third quarter of last year, reflecting ongoing weakness of the Intragastric Balloon market in the United States. In total, our third quarter 2019 continuing product revenues increased $1.1 million or 12% as reported and 14% in constant currency compared to the third quarter of 2018. Total GAAP revenues in the third quarter of 2019 were $4 million lower compared to the third quarter of 2018 as a result of divestiture of our surgical product line that occurred in December of last year. This comparability issue will continue to affect our reporting in the fourth quarter. Gross margin for the third quarter 2019 was 48.3% compared to 54.7% in the prior year period. The declining gross margin between years was due largely to the shift in our revenue to ESS sales, which carries a lower margin than our other products, partially offset by the positive impact of the 2 gross margin projects we completed last fall. We are actively working on several gross margin improvement projects that will lower our ESS unit costs. One such project that we recently completed was represented by the 510(k) clearance of our future anchor assembly. Todd will cover the estimated impact of that development shortly in more detail. Total operating expenses were $12.3 million for the third quarter 2019 compared to $15.8 million in the third quarter of 2018. This decrease of $3.6 million was due to 3 primary factors. First, research and development expense was $1.5 million lower as a result of the higher MERIT ESG enrollment in the third quarter of last year. Second, intangible amortization was $1.3 million lower, following the divestiture of our surgical products last December. And third, U.S. sales and marketing costs were lower on lower consumer advertising costs. Our net loss for the third quarter of 2019 was $8.7 million compared to $9.8 million for the third quarter 2018. Cash at the end of the third quarter was $36 million. And as Todd mentioned in his opening remarks, we issued $20 million of convertible notes to existing investors during the third quarter. As to fourth quarter sales, we expect to achieve continuing product sales growth consistent with our year-to-date performance. And then with respect to consolidated gross margin, we expect our year-to-date 2019 gross margin or full year '19 gross margin to be in the range of 48% to 52%, given the higher mix of OverStitch product sales. With that, I'll now turn it back to Todd. Todd Newton : Thank you, Stephanie. As you know by now, the third quarter was another strong growth period for our OverStitch or ESS products as our U.S. commercial organization delivered an impressive 48% increase year-over-year in U.S. ESS sales in the quarter, which amounts to 37% year to date. Outside the United States, in constant currency, sales of our ESS products were up 12% in the quarter and a solid 23% year to date. Our success, in my opinion, continues to be our ability to deliver excellent medical education to our user base. Our experience continues to be that once a physician has built his or her initial level of technical proficiency that OverStitch then becomes a very sticky product. And these users then find an ever-growing number of ways to use the OverStitch device in their clinical practice. As I mentioned last quarter, we continue to work closely with customers to identify and share various tweaks to technique that can further improve the overall user experience. At the opening of this call, I hit some highlights of this quarter's medical education activity. The American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy's STAR Program is particularly noteworthy as one of the highest-quality training events we are associated with. The STAR acronym stands for Skills, Training, Assessment and Reinforcement, and the ASGE offers four such programs of which one of the four is dedicated to suturing. The curriculum is highly structured, consisting of 3 components that must be completed sequentially. Those being an online course, a live course with hands-on training and a post-course skills assessment and test. And upon successful completion, participants receive a certificate from the ASGE. This is a great program conducted at ASGE's facilities outside of Chicago with ASGE contracted faculty. This time, the course featured both the single-channel and dual-channel OverStitch device at every station. On the clinical side, the MERIT trial is the first randomized controlled trial of the ESG procedure, which uses OverStitch. And as most investors know, this trial is the linchpin of our ESG reimbursement strategy. As previously announced, the principal investigators in the MERIT trial completed patient enrollment in June and submitted an Investigational Device Exemption or IDE for the trial, which was approved by the FDA in August. We understand that all of the MERIT patients in the initial treatment arm have now received the procedure, and all study patients are in various stages of their follow-up period. The 80-patient initial treatment arm is to be followed for two years, and the 120-patient control group can potentially cross over to four ESG treatment after one year, and a number of these crossover procedures have already taken place. On other key ESS clinical programs, the AGA registry, which is intended to capture core GI uses and bariatric revisions using suturing, here in the United States now has over 9 sites contracted with more than 125 patient cases recorded. In Europe, the bariatric registry that began in May of last year to capture data on ESG and bariatric surgery revisions has over 340 patient cases reported. Additionally, the European GI registry to build data and awareness of core GI uses of OverStitch in Europe, where core GI experience is lower than it is here in the United States, but still represents a great area for upside in our view now has more than 140 cases recorded. This quarter, there continued to be a steady flow of new papers published in various peer-reviewed literature by clinicians about OverStitch results. 12 new papers were published describing the use of endoscopic suturing for a variety of gastrointestinal conditions other than primary obesity. And then in addition, there were another 13 new papers published this quarter to further describe clinical results from the ESG procedure, including 2 meta-analysis and the first published results of the ESG procedure by clinicians in India. Finally, we have discussed for many quarters, our ongoing gross margin improvement initiative. This overall effort involves multiple projects over multiple quarters. The latest project culminated with the receipt in September of FDA's clearance for our polypropylene suture anchor assembly. This assembly is the implant component of the OverStitch system. It passes an anchor suture within the gastrointestinal track. Obtaining 510(k) clearance for our own proprietary suture anchor is expected to reduce our product costs by approximately $1 million annually once fully implemented, which we expect to occur in 2020. This approval also facilitates our access to new global markets. We expect solid growth throughout the remainder of 2019 from both the dual and single-channel OverStitch devices, giving us good momentum going into 2020. With respect to our IGB products, strategically, we are pursuing development of the medical market, where we think there is a strong value proposition. Our medical market development efforts are concentrated on selected conditions where short-term weight loss can provide meaningful benefit to the treatment of comorbidities associated with obesity and where we believe reimbursement efforts have potential for success. We've discussed these in the past, and they include NASH or fatty liver disease, weight loss in advance of a solid organ transplant, the weight loss prior to either a joint replacement or general surgery. In the future, we should be able to provide more details of these activities as they progress. Last quarter, we disclosed an application for Level 1 CPT code for intragastric balloons were submitted under the sponsorship of five medical societies. We've since learned consideration of this application has been postponed. Lastly, in Brazil, in July, the National Health Agency issued its 2020 private health plan reimbursement guidelines, which will require private health insurance in Brazil to include Intragastric Balloon treatment as part of their bariatric coverage next year. We are still assessing this policy decision, but I think it is directionally a very encouraging development for this market. Private health plans cover approximately 45 million people in Brazil. Currently, the Intragastric Balloon business in Brazil is a cash pay cosmetically focused marketplace. To recap, it was a very good sales quarter for OverStitch and a highly productive quarter for our market and clinical development efforts. Additionally, we further solidified our balance sheet with new capital from a set of loyal and supportive investors. And with that, we'll now open the lines for questions. Operator, if you will? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum Capital. Matt Hewitt : First off, it's a very strong quarter for OverStitch. And I'm just wondering, if you could provide maybe a little bit of color as to where you're seeing the growth? Or is it pretty evenly spread out? Meaning, is it ESG? Or are you seeing it in some of these other opportunities like GERD and colorectal? Just any color along those lines. Todd Newton : Yes, Matt. The growth appears to us to be coming from all uses of OverStitch. The core GI area is really going well. We continue to see great growth in just core GI applications, whether it's upper GI or lower GI. Most of that will be upper GI. The treatment of obesity continues to be also area of big interest for OverStitch from the standpoint of new users, but also, we're seeing that those who are offering the ESG procedure continued to do very well with it. They have good patient experiences. And of course, good patient experience begets new patient experience. So it's coming from all over the board, and we're very, very happy about that. We really feel like the promise of OverStitch is that it drives more endoluminal surgeries as broadly as you'd like to define it. And that was always the intent with OverStitch, and it's satisfying to see that, that is the case in the market today. Matt Hewitt : That's great. And then, I guess, recently, the American Academy of Pediatrics came out with a paper, encouraging more the option of bariatric and metabolic surgeries for adolescents and kids. How does that kind of factor into the opportunity for you? I would think it's more geared towards OverStitch, but possibly Orbera. But how are you -- and I realize this is recent, but how are you -- what are your thoughts on that? Todd Newton : Really, at this point, Matt, I would say that we don't have a defined strategy to pursue per se, the pediatric area. Our focus right now when it comes to the weight loss procedure using OverStitch and ESG is to support its reimbursement among the adult population. That's where the bariatric coverage exists today. And so we're going to remain focused on that opportunity. We do know that there is an addressable market in pediatrics. But that's not a core part of our current strategy at this time. Matt Hewitt : Okay. Maybe one last one from me and then I'll hop back in the queue. Regarding the -- obviously, it sounds like a very strong quarter of getting new doctors trained and up and running on OverStitch. Is there -- do you have any ability to break down your revenues in the quarter between existing or those doctors and surgeons that had previously been trained versus new for us? Todd Newton : Well, thank you, Matt. We, at this point, have not made that disclosure, but we will consider that in future reporting. Operator : Your next question is from the line of JP McKim with Piper Jaffray. Jonathan McKim : I wanted to just ask on OverStitch and ESS and then -- like, internationally, it looks like it was down about $1 million, it's flat in the U.S. But it sounds like you're training a lot of doctors. So I'm just trying to figure out, when a lot of those trains will contribute to sort of revenue growth going forward? And just maybe could you help me understand what happened internationally on that front? Todd Newton : Yes. I think what you -- we've basically been disclosing now in our investor deck and talking about this for quite some time. We have a very robust and healthy mix of procedure use here in the United States, whereas outside the United States, there is far more weight-loss application for OverStitch. And another way to say that is far less core GI use of OverStitch in the markets outside the United States. And as a result, it does make our -- outside the United States business a little bit more dependent on cash pay dynamics than we have in the U.S. And in the third quarter, we had a couple of the cash pay markets for OverStitch, where the economics just created headwinds for that procedure. That's one of the reasons why we're so focused on the core GI area, especially through programs like our core GI registry in Europe to really start to identify the uses in that marketplace for OverStitch that is not related to weight loss because we think that ultimately builds us a more solid, predictable business like we have established now or would appear in the U.S. Jonathan McKim : Okay. And then I think -- was there an update to the total window guidance? I think you guided to 15%. I didn't -- is there an update to that number? And then, I assume that's sort of how we should think about the go-forward business next year. And so I guess, do you feel comfortable with the go-forward business growing in the teens here when you look out to 2020? Stefanie Cavanaugh : So we did provide an update. Given that we have 9 months in our year-to-date actuals, we would guide you to expect Q4 results to be similar too on the first 9 months of the year. And so that's a little bit less than the 15% growth we have provided in the past. And then we would expect OverStitch to continue to perform at the very high rates that we've been getting and for bariatric to continue the trends that we've had this year as well. Jonathan McKim : Okay. Then I'll just ask, on the 300 positions, could you maybe -- like are a lot of those getting trained on the FX? Or are they getting trained on the dual channel? And then could you maybe give us a base of reference for Q1 and Q2? Like, if you trained 300 in Q3, what was that level of training like in previous quarters? Todd Newton : Yes, thanks, JP. And so for Q3, we had a really busy quarter, as I was mentioning in the prepared remarks. We had a couple of major doctor meetings, where we supported training that they wanted to conduct with both product and also staffing. And so that probably makes Q3 somewhat busier than what we would have done in Q3 in the past. Just it falls under the timing of the calendar for some of these events. And oftentimes, a doctor will come in with a preference for one device versus the other. But we have, since the introduction of Sx, continued to make both products available in front and center in our training effort. Operator : And there are no other questions at this time. Todd Newton : Well, great. Then with that, operator, thank you. And in closing, we just want to thank you for your interest in Apollo Endosurgery today. And should you have any questions or need for follow-up, please contact Matt Kreps at Darrow Associates, whose contact details are listed in our press release today, and we look forward to opportunities to meet with you at a number of upcoming investor events, including the Craig-Hallum Alpha Select Conference in November and the Piper Jaffray Healthcare and the LD Micro Main Event conferences that occur in December. Thank you, again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Susie Lisa. Please go ahead. Susan Lisa : Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Michael Mahoney : Good morning. Thank you, Susie. Good morning, everyone. Boston Scientific finished up a strong 2019 as we significantly strengthened our portfolio and capabilities for the future by delivering strong revenue and EPS growth. Consistent with preliminary results we announced on January 14th, we delivered 14.1% operational revenue growth and 7.3% organic revenue growth for the fourth quarter of '19. This represents excellent growth, yet was below our organic revenue guidance of 8% to 9% due primarily to our US high-voltage and US EP businesses. Importantly, operational growth outside of the US in both CRM and EP were solid as were worldwide result in five of our other divisions, which all grew at or above market and three posted double-digit growth, Interventional Cardiology, Urology, Pelvic Health and Endoscopy. Daniel Brennan : Thanks, Mike. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue of $2.905 billion, represents 13.4% reported revenue growth and reflects an $18 million headwind from foreign exchange, slightly less than the $20 million to $25 million headwind expected at the time of the guidance. On an operational basis, revenue growth was 14.1% in the quarter. Sales from the Vertiflex and BTG acquisitions, partially offset by the divestiture of our legacy embolic beads portfolio contributed a net 680 basis points of growth at the high end of our acquisition contribution guidance range. Of the 680 basis points, BTG contributed 610 basis points split between Interventional Medicine contributing 380 basis points and Specialty Pharmaceuticals, 230 basis points. The resulting 7.3% organic revenue growth in the quarter was below our organic guidance range of 8% to 9%, as Mike detailed. Despite the mix, we delivered Q4 adjusted earnings per share of $0.46, above our guidance range of $0.42 to $0.45, representing 16% year-over-year growth and 19% growth excluding the $0.01 net tax benefit in Q4 2018. Earnings were driven by healthy P&L metrics across the Board, as well as an approximate $0.03 tax benefit, higher than expected at the time of our preliminary fourth quarter and full year results announcement. The tax benefit is related to both discrete tax items within the quarter, as well as the lower full year operational tax rate, which I will detail shortly. The FX impact on adjusted earnings per share was immaterial as expected at the time of guidance. Our full year 2019 consolidated revenue of $10.735 billion grew 9.3% on a reported basis and 11.1% on an operational basis, which includes 380 basis points of growth related to the acquisitions of NxThera, Claret, Augmenix, Vertiflex and BTG, net the divestiture of the beads portfolio. Operational growth was in line with our guidance as the contribution from acquisitions was slightly higher than our expectations and organic growth of 7.3% was slightly below our guidance of approximately 7.5%. Full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share of $1.58 represents 8% growth or 13% excluding the 2018 net tax benefit of $0.07 in the base. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 73.1% just above the midpoint of our guidance range and an improvement of 30 basis points over the prior year due to manufacturing improvements, favorable FX and mix driven primarily by strong sales in our WATCHMAN franchise. For the full year 2019, adjusted gross margin was 72.4% within our guidance range and represents a 10 basis points improvement over 2018. The full year impact of FX to adjusted gross margin was a positive 70 basis points in line with our expectations and along with manufacturing improvements was offset by price erosion, primarily in coronary drug-eluting stents and pacers. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $1,026 million  or 35.3% of sales in Q4 above our guidance range, primarily due to the lower sales, but an improvement of 40 basis points over the prior year period. Throughout the year, we balanced the need to fund initiatives related to key commercial launches and recent acquisitions, with our commitment to operating expense control and optimization. As a result, we were able to achieve our full year 2019 guidance and decreased adjusted SG&A spending by 30 basis points year-over-year to 35.1%. Adjusted research and development expenses were $297 million in the fourth quarter or 10.2% of sales, which is down 60 basis points from Q4 2018, primarily due to the timing of certain investments and we're also gaining traction within our R&D efficiency efforts. For the full year 2019, adjusted R&D expenses were $1,138 million or 10.6% of sales, compared to 10.7% in 2018. Royalty expense was 0.6% of sales in Q4 and the full year 2019, which was roughly flat year-over-year for both periods. As a result, Q4 2019 adjusted operating margin of 27% improved 150 basis points year-over-year and is within our guidance range of 27% to 28%. We also met our full year 2019 adjusted operating margin commitment with a rate of 26.1%, representing an improvement of 60 basis points over the full year 2018. I'll now move below the line to interest and other expense. Adjusted interest expense for the quarter was $93 million, compared to $62 million in Q4 of 2018. Our average interest rate expense was 6.6% in Q4 2019 or 3.4% excluding the bond repurchase costs related to our Eurobond offering, compared to 3.5% in Q4 of 2018. Adjusted other expense for the quarter was $17 million, compared to adjusted other income of $4 million a year ago, primarily due to a net gain on certain of our available for sale investments in Q4 2018 and both periods include expenses related to our foreign exchange hedging program. For the full year 2019, adjusted interest expense and adjusted other expenses were $325 million and $65 million, respectively, resulting in total below the line expenses of $390 million. This is in line with guidance and an increase from 2018 largely due to the acquisition of BTG, as well as the make-whole call exercised in Q1 of 2019 to execute the early retirement of our 2020 notes. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 4.5% on an adjusted basis below our guidance of approximately 11% due to discrete tax benefits within the quarter, as well as a lower full year operational tax rate. Our full year tax rate was 7.3% on an adjusted basis also below our guidance of approximately 9% due to the lower operational tax rate. On a GAAP basis our tax rate for the fourth quarter and full year included a deferred tax benefit of $4.1 billion related to transfers of certain intellectual property rights among our various wholly-owned subsidiaries. These transactions more closely align the global economic ownership of our intellectual property rights with our current and future business operations. We ended Q4 2019 with $1.413 billion and full year 2019 with 1.411 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $638 million, compared to $659 million in Q4 2018. In the quarter, we used cash primarily to pay down $900 million of BTG-related debt, executing on our plan to achieve a debt leverage ratio of approximately 2.6 times EBITDA by the end of 2020. As of December 31, 2019 we had cash on hand of $217 million. Our full year 2019 adjusted free cash flow of $2 billion is lower than guidance and down slightly year-over-year as a result of the timing of capital expenditures and increased working capital requirements, mainly in inventory to support upcoming new product launches. We continue to target double-digit adjusted free cash flow growth for the future and our goal for full year 2020 adjusted free cash flow is $2.3 billion, which would represent 15% growth over 2019. On a GAAP basis, we recorded a net litigation-related charge of $223 million in the fourth quarter, primarily related to litigation with Channel Medsystems. This drove $129 million sequential increase in our total legal reserve to $697 million as of December 31, 2019, which otherwise would have decreased sequentially as we continue to work to fully resolve the mesh litigation. Over 95% of all known claims are settled or in the final stages of settlement and we expect to pay the remaining $115 million of anticipated payments into the qualified settlement funds in 2020, which will then resolve all significant existing contingencies related to mesh. As a reminder, this liability is released from our balance sheet as payments are made out of the qualified settlement funds to plan. Capital expenditures for the full year 2019 totaled $461 million above the high end of our range of $375 million to $400 million, primarily due to timing and some pull-forward from 2020 in manufacturing capacity in anticipation of certain 2020 product launches. We expect capital expenditures to be in a range of $450 million to $475 million for 2020, as we continue to build capacity, integrate acquisitions and position the company for growth. I'll now walk through guidance for Q1 and the full year 2020. For the full year, we expect 2020 reported revenue growth to be in a range of approximately 10% to 12%, which corresponds to 6.5% to 8.5% on an organic basis, with an approximate 350-basis-point contribution from the Vertiflex and BTG acquisitions net the divestiture of the beads portfolio. As a reminder, Vertiflex is included in organic guidance for 2020 as of June and BTG as of August, at which time the divested beads portfolio will also no longer have an operational impact. We expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $30 million to $40 million for the full year 2020. However, as I'll detail shortly, due to our hedging program, we expect the FX impact to EPS to be neutral for the year. We expect our adjusted gross margin for the year as a percentage of sales to be approximately 72% for the full year with no FX impact. We do not anticipate material improvement over full year 2019, as manufacturing improvements will be offset by pricing declines, which are expected to be slightly higher than usual due to biannual Japan price cuts and China tenders, in addition to mixed challenges from our new high-growth products that are initially dilutive to total company gross margin such as Exalt-D, POLARx and LOTUS Edge. We expect full year adjusted SG&A to be in the range of 34.5% to 35%. This assumes, up to 60 basis points of improvement over 2019, as we continue to execute on our cost optimization initiatives and also recognize the benefits of programs currently underway. Full year adjusted R&D is expected to be in a range of 10% to 10.5% and we expect our royalty rate to remain at less than 1% of sales for 2020. This implies a full year 2020 adjusted operating margin of approximately 26.7%, which represents 60 basis points of improvement over 2019, consistent with our previously outlined goal of 50 basis points to 100 basis points of annual improvement. We continue to make progress towards our long-term goal of 30% adjusted operating margin. We forecast our full year 2020 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 10%, consistent with our disclosure in January. This assumes an operational tax rate of approximately 11% with an approximately 100 basis points of benefit from the accounting standard for stock compensation. We expect adjusted below the line expenses which include interest payments, dilution from our VC portfolio and costs associated with our hedging program to be approximately $400 million to $425 million for the year. And we expect fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.417 billion shares for Q1 2020 and 1.421 billion shares for full year 2020. As a result, we expect full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.74 to $1.79, representing 10% to 13% adjusted earnings growth and we expect FX to be neutral for the year if rates hold constant. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share to be in a range of $0.95 to $1. Now turning to Q1 2020, we anticipate reported revenue growth to be in a range of approximately 10% to 12%, which represents 11% to 13% operational growth and an approximately 600-basis-point contribution from the Vertaflex and BTG acquisitions, net the divestiture of the beads portfolio. On an organic basis, we believe our business without the impact of the Coronavirus would be in a range of 6% to 7.5% growth year-over-year. However, while we're still in the very early stages of assessing the impact and highly focused on supporting our patients and employees in China, we believe it is prudent to include a potential impact to our Q1 revenue related to the Coronavirus. Our best estimate at this time is a preliminary $10 million to $40 million potential negative impact to revenue as a result of deferred procedures, supply chain and other disruptions. Although, it is early, the Chinese healthcare system is highly focused on containing the spread of the virus, and thus, we expect to see a reduction in volume for all non-emergency medical device procedures as it will not be business as usual in China, in February and March. This $10 million to $40 million potential negative impact results in Q1 2020 organic growth guidance of 5% to 7%. Full year organic growth of 6.5% to 8.5% contemplates our ability to recapture some of the lost procedure volume in China during the year, as well as other offsets throughout the remainder of the year. Note that given the leap year, Q1 includes an extra selling day over prior year, but this equates to roughly one-half of a day sequentially based on the weighted average of selling days globally. We expect the foreign exchange impact on Q1 revenue to be an approximate $25 million to $30 million headwind. For the first quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.37 per share to $0.40 per share, representing 6% to 15% growth and GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.16 per share to $0.19 per share. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2019 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q4 and full year results, as well as Q1 and full year 2020 guidance including P&L line item guidance. So with that, I'll turn it back to Susan, who will moderate the Q&A. Susan Lisa : Thanks, Dan. Greg, let's open it up to questions for the next 25 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Greg, please go ahead. Operator : Thank you.  Your first question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Michael Mahoney : Robbie, can you hear us? Robert Marcus : I can hear you. Can you hear me? Michael Mahoney : We hear you now. Daniel Brennan : We can hear you. Robert Marcus : Great. Maybe you could just start with the top-line guidance for 2020. The range is a little wider than we've seen from you historically. You have a lot of new product launches into new markets in 2020. Maybe just walk through the rationale for the wider guidance range and any important cadence issues to pay attention to? Michael Mahoney : Sure, yes. So, the full year guidance organic. You heard in the script there 6.5 to 8.5. We think 200 basis points wide range isn't crazy for a company our size. So we think that makes sense. Similar to '19, in '19 we saw 6.3% organic in the first half, 8.3% organic the second half. And so we expect a similar trend in 2020. As I mentioned, you'll see second half acceleration as mentioned due to the product cadence and we can talk about the various products, if you'd like, as well as the M&A train organic. And also we expect hopefully, we aim for a resolution of the potential impact in China as we enter the second quarter. So we'll see second half acceleration and we expect many of our businesses to grow double-digit. We expect UroPH and Endo, as well as EP all to accelerate in 2020. We expect PI to put up a first quarter similar to fourth quarter. We expect nice acceleration due to important product launches in PI, as well as the integration going on plan. And we've also given the Structural Heart guidance $900 million to $1 billion, which is a significant increase over 2019. So we're very confident in the product launches that we have across all the divisions. And the execution, our aim will be to accelerate organic revenue growth in '20 faster than we did in '19. Robert Marcus : Great. And maybe just the follow-up on CRM at the JP Morgan Conference when you pre-announced, you thought that some of the softness in fourth quarter was due to replacements and high power. Have you been able to dig into that any further and come up with why maybe replacements were softer in December versus expectations? Michael Mahoney : Yes. So we don't have all the market data yet. It's still too early to receive kind of unit volume across the industry. Similar to what I mentioned before, we think primarily the impact in Q4 was due to our comps. We had mid-single-digit positive comps. Our competitors had negative comps and so we don't see a -- we don't believe that we lost market share in defib in fourth quarter. We think we faced a tougher comp than our competitors did. And also we don't have the ICM loop recorder yet and some competitors include that in their sales. So in a pure like-for-like basis, we think we held share and we do think the market is a bit softer though. We think the market in 2020, we project global CRM to be flat to declining low single-digit. And we expect -- we obviously aim to continue to grow faster than the market, like, we have for many years in defib, but we think the market growth is probably zero to negative 2% for the full year. Robert Marcus : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Robert Hopkins : Thank you and good morning. So first question just wanted to ask about the guidance you're providing for the first quarter that 5% to 7% and if you use the midpoint of your assumptions on Coronavirus maybe 6% to 8% excluding that. My question is that, even excluding the slower China growth in Q1, it does feel like a deceleration from what you've been experiencing over the last couple of quarters, given the selling day and an easier comp in the first quarter. So what do you assume slows in Q1 relative to the last couple of quarters or is this just you guys being conservative? Michael Mahoney : Sure. Good morning, Bob. So, again, we're very comfortable in the quarterly guidance we provided as well as the full year and we aim to accelerate in '20 over '19 organic growth, which I think is the most important piece here. We look at first quarter there is an extra what Dan calls a half day, when we look at all the global selling days and so forth. So there's a slight benefit there. But as mentioned in the script in a few areas, we do expect to see in first quarter Endo decelerate a little bit from first -- from fourth quarter, as well as PI being soft again in first quarter similar to fourth quarter. So those kind of are in line. And we also see some challenges in drug eluting stents with Japan price cuts, as well as the overall pricing environment in drug-eluting stents. So we anticipate that in the first quarter and we talked about the CRM market kind of zero to negative 2% range. But importantly, we have some nice mixed launches in DBS to support the full year and we expect to see continued complex coronary growth do well. And then all the other businesses across the company should do extremely well with Structural Heart . But in first quarter the combination of some of those pricing pressures we're seeing in DBS combined with the Coronavirus issue that Dan outlined and really moving through that BTG integration that was the guidance of the 6 to 7.5 pre-Coronavirus and we estimate the impact, as I mentioned, 10 to 40 from China which brings our first quarter guidance down to 5 to 7. Robert Hopkins : Okay. And then maybe as just a sort of an obvious follow-up on that. What do you assume in Endo slows a little bit in Q1? And then also I'd love to see hear your comments on Exalt-D in terms of what you're expecting for the year out of that product? Thank you. Michael Mahoney : Yes. So Endo is one of our more predictable businesses, I would say, in the company. Very good execution against our plans. And it's not uncommon for them to have a slightly softer first quarter. So slightly soft is going to be above the BSC average and likely above market. So their definition of soft there is probably not fair. But as we see -- as we look at the full year, they have a nice set of product launches with new hemostasis clip, improvements to digital SpyGlass and the big one the Exalt-D. And we've had our first few cases take place over the past week and they want -- they're very, very encouraging. And so you're going to see a kind of more of a controlled launch in the first quarter to make sure things are going well. A lot of the contracting in terms of the capital placements are being organized now and we're very confident in acceleration really each month in Exalt with a much bigger impact in second quarter and a significant impact in the second half of the year, and then the surgical scope coming. So I think we're really on track with Exalt-D launch and couldn't be more excited about the early results. Robert Hopkins : Great. Thank you. Daniel Brennan : And then just to give you a little bit of the math on the ranges. So the 6% to 7.5% is the range without Coronavirus for Q1 in terms of organic revenue growth. Just to let you know how we got to the 5 to 7. So the low end of 5 is basically the midpoint of 6.75 and we took the high end of the risk of 10 to 40 for the Coronavirus and took that off to get to the 5. And then, saying, similarly for the high end of 7 it's the 7.5 high end less the low end of the Coronavirus of 10 million, which brings you to the 7%. So just to give you a little bit of that math as to how it came to 5 to 7 from the 6 to 7.5. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Lewis : Good morning. Just two questions for me. Dan I want to come back to Coronavirus just to sort of set expectations. So by our quick math, China is kind of 5% of the company. Maybe it was a point of growth to 2019. I appreciate the focus in the first quarter. But picking those numbers, it seems like you're implying for first quarter that China business is either a 10% grower kind of half what you grew last year 20% or maybe slightly declined. Is that kind of roughly accurate? And what's actually in the annual guidance for impact from China given it drove a point of growth from last year? Then I had a quick follow-up. Michael Mahoney : Sure. I mean, as we talked about at our Investor Day, China was about a $500 million business growing 20%. That would imply about a $600 million business in 2020. So rough math $50 million a month. The 10 and the 40 are simply the impacts our China team that's obviously very close to the issues in China on the ground. That's how they size it today and so that's why we included that in the Q1 guide. For the full year, as you saw, the 6.5 to 8.5, we assume that we can get some of those procedural volumes back and that other parts of the company could kick in and keep that 6.5% to 8.5% organic revenue growth range intact. But it's just the ability to react within Q1 with the acute nature of what we see as the potential in China that's why we raised it. David Lewis : Okay. And then you are seeing that impact. You have seen that impact here in the early part of January into February? Michael Mahoney : As you look at China, I mean, everybody sees it on the news and such. There just -- the number of procedures for medical device procedures in Q1 is not going to be what was expected 90 days or 180 days ago. So, certainly, we are planning to see an impact in that business in Q1. David Lewis : Okay. And then just for the guidance for the year, just two things maybe for Dan or for Mike. One, obviously, you talked about second half acceleration. Maybe just help us understand the key drivers of that second half acceleration from a product perspective? And kind of related to that, your two big products from a revenue perspective absolute dollar contribution are Augmenix and LOTUS maybe just sort of talk to your confidence in those two products and what drives that back half acceleration? Thanks so much. Michael Mahoney : Sure. We have a number of things we could talk about. But just to hit on the biggest -- the bigger ones. The biggest growth driver contributor is going to be Structural Heart that $900 million to $1 billion. And the big impacts there are excited about led by WATCHMAN, with the new WATCHMAN FLX launch will happen in the US in the second half of the year and that's doing extremely well in Europe and we have a number of big clinical trials. So we expect very strong growth on a WATCHMAN. LOTUS is doing very well in the market. It's kind of on plan for 150 accounts. So you'll see a full year impact of LOTUS and we expect to see each quarter greater impact there. Our Symetis valve, ACURATE is doing well. It grew above the company average and grew about mid-teens in the fourth quarter and we expect to see neo2 launching in the second half. So the whole basket of Structural Heart will be big. EXALT will be a meaningful new incremental revenue driver with stronger second half impact. And then in PI, I would say, we're confident in quarterly improvements as we settled in on the BTG integration and you have new products being launched from legacy BTG, as well as potentially Ranger in the second half of 2020, which will put our position there. And EP, I mentioned, POLARx, you'll see a nice impact from that particularly in the second half of the year as we ramp that up. And Neuro continues to do well with, as you mentioned, Augmenix which did over $100 million and is growing very, very well, as well as NxThera, which also is doing well and we'll expect five-year data shortly, and new reimbursement approvals from Cigna and Blue Cross. So this is really across the portfolio. There's a number of exciting things. That's why to reinforce Dan's comment, despite some of the near-term issues in China we're very comfortable with 6.5% to 8.5% full year range. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel. Please go ahead. Frederick Wise : Hi. Good morning, Mike. If we could focus -- if I can focus on Exalt-D. Obviously, you're excited, we've had a bunch of in-depth doctor conversations lately. Happily, all of them want to try it and we're interested, some very interested. But they highlighted usability and sort of comparability to their current reusable technology. And they were all seemed uncertain about pricing and cost. Can you talk to us about your confidence that Exalt-D equals current reusable technology? Talk to us about pricing and how you're going to go at making the economic case to the docs and the hospitals? And maybe last just talk about the manufacturing ramp and how that ties into the acceleration as you move toward full launch? Thanks so much. Michael Mahoney : Thanks, Rick. So the teams have -- as you know this has been a multi-year program built off of the capabilities we've learned with LithoVue in digital SpyGlass. Those capabilities leveraged for Exalt-D and you hit the key criteria. The number one criteria, if this is to be a blockbuster product, which we think it will be -- it will -- to be -- have comparable, usability and functionality as existing scopes that require the sterilization expense of processes. And so that is the spec that the team has been focused on over the past three years or four years. And so the good news is, we've had done a number of procedures. We've had a number of key positions around the globe involved with the product for multiple years and we're quite confident in the design elements and the visualization capabilities of the product. Also, I think what's important with this with the FDA-approved device and the capabilities of the team, we'll be able to make improvements to the platform within each year. And so just like we've done with digital and with LithoVue, expect to see probably a once-a-year enhancements upgrade, if you will, to the platform. And so it's not as if this is a stagnant product and which sometimes you get with the reusables for many years. This is a product that we'll be able to enhance at least once per year throughout the next year period whether it be smaller handles, left-handed, right-handed, different user features that the competition doesn't have. So I think that cadence will allow us to please physicians and the spec is to make it as good. On the manufacturing side, we have a lot of experience with this. We've been investing ahead of it. That's one reason why you saw the increase in our capital investment in '19 and '20 as to manage the volume that we expect. So we're comfortable with the ramp that we have laid out with acceleration in the second quarter and beyond. On the economics of it, it's a complicated topic. We do believe there's ample room in the existing reimbursement within patient at roughly $4,000 to $12 -- to $11,500 and outpatient $3000 to call it $5000. And we're also, as you know, we did receive FDA kind of the breakthrough status, which potentially could help with additional potential reimbursement tailwinds. In terms of the pricing itself, we have lots of flexibility within our Endo business to price it on its own and potentially look at contracting capabilities leveraging our portfolio across the business there. Frederick Wise : Thanks so much for all that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Thanks for taking my question. So Mike maybe one follow-up on the guidance and then I had one for Dan. On the guidance the comments around the cadence first half versus second half. If I recollect last year you had the days impact in second half. I mean, I appreciate all the comments on Structural Heart but shouldn't Structural Heart cadence to be similar to last year? So the real incremental for our new products, which should step up in second half. Is that the right way to think about that ? And just on the range itself 6.5% to 8.5%, are you comfortable at the midpoint of the range or -- and I appreciate the wider range just given Q4 and market factors, but just want to get a sense whether you're comfortable at the midpoint? Daniel Brennan : Sure. This is Dan, Vijay. So on the Structural Heart piece, I think, that's fair that as you look at the LOTUS launch that's obviously a very controlled rollout that we've had and that should gain momentum over time as should Sentinel. Mike mentioned that neo2 comes out in the second half. So I think that's fair relative to Structural Heart. We obviously wouldn't give a specific number within the guidance range of 6.5% to 8.5% organic for the full year. But then you heard in Mike's commentary that our goal is to accelerate in 2020 off 2019. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful Dan. And then one on the margins here, Dan, I think, I heard you mention in a China tender, Japan biannual price cuts. What specifically is the impact from those factors on gross margin? And on the operating line, does it have any impact on the mix just given BTG is coming in because it looks like you're implying 50 basis points margin expansion? Thank you. Daniel Brennan : Yes. Actually on that prior question from my WATCHMAN team friends here. I want to make sure I include WATCHMAN FLX in the US as well, because that's a huge launch for the WATCHMAN team, who has done a fantastic job since inception. On the price impact, as I look at it, the summary would be, we just have a little bit more price across the enterprise this year in a couple of those areas, as we mentioned, the biannual Japan price cut and the China that will not allow the normal manufacturing cost improvements to poke their head above that and have gross margin go north. The normal equation is you have your manufacturing cost improvements then you have pricing and mix, and the net of those three normally has gross margin increasing. This year the pricing is a little bit higher with China and Japan, and potentially some acceleration on the DES front there, as Mike mentioned. So that really just all netted out where margin -- gross margin should be in that approximately 72% range we set. That's not a surprise to us. It's what we've been saying all along for the last two years is that gross margin, which has paid a lot of the builds over the last five years or six years would slow in terms of its ability to contribute to operating margin improvement, and then SG&A and R&D would pick up that slack. You saw that in 2019 and you should see the same thing in 2020. Vijay Kumar : Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Lawrence Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions guys. One on complex PCI, one on Neuromodulation. So your complex PCI business continues to do really well. But that's a business that we don't have a lot of visibility on. So my question for you Mike or Dan is, how are you feeling about the sustainability of growth in that business in 2020 and what are the drivers? And I had one follow-up. Michael Mahoney : Sure. That business as we've mentioned is larger than DES and continues to do very well around the globe and it's really maybe our most important business in Asia-Pac. So that strategically is a very big business for us. It requires more clinical orientation, which is also helpful and more in our sweet spot and also it is under less pricing pressure, I would say, compared to drug-eluting stents. So the innovation there is really important. And you see a big focus on our Ivis and rural later platform, as well as WOLVERINE and maybe Ian can touch on some other key products. But it's really a key cadence of new products that we have, as well as a big focus on complex PCI training that we have around the globe and how our portfolio matches that. Ian Meredith : I think you've said most of it Mark. I think the thing I'd say, Larry, it's most important is the population is aging. And so the burden of disease is appearing later. And so we're seeing more patients with more complex due to the later age with more comorbidities, less suitable for surgery. So just the sheer demographic change is actually driving the burden of complex coronary disease in late age. So it requires more complex interventions. Lawrence Biegelsen : That's helpful. And just on Neuromodulation, Mike and Dan, you gave a lot of helpful color on the different businesses for 2020. But I wasn't sure if I heard your expectations for Neuromodulation for 2020 relative to 2019. So how do you see that business in 2020 relative to 2019 on an organic basis? Thanks for taking the questions guys. Michael Mahoney : Sure. Yes. We're hopeful that -- we aim for that business, I would say, to accelerate versus '19. If you look at '19 our SCS business was slow, the market was slow and we had extremely difficult comps the prior year. And so we would expect our global SCS business to improve over '19 and 2020. And also you heard at NANS, as well as detail out in some of the script, some of the clinical benefits we have with that portfolio. So, I think truly on a comp basis and expectations for the market to improve somewhat, we would expect that to improve. And in DBS we just have a lot of really good momentum there. Excellent share taking is taking place in Europe and in the US and you'll see some additional clinical studies being presented with that platform and we touched on some of the product differentiation there. So, and then you have Vertiflex, which will go organic in the second half of the year. So we think broadly speaking Neuromodulator will grow faster in '20 than '19. Lawrence Biegelsen : Thanks for taking the questions guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen. Please go ahead. Josh Jennings : Hi, good morning. Thanks. And just two questions, first on China, I understand you provided nice details around the 1Q potential headwind. But can you help us get a little bit more granular? And any help just in terms of your exposure in China by business unit? I mean, its Cardiovascular Interventional Cardiology most exposed or is it more broad-based? And then on the second question just WATCHMAN FLX. Many comments today just on it being a driver. Can you help us understand the boost that you'll get from WATCHMAN FLX launch? Is that premium pricing are there accounts out there that are waiting for WATCHMAN FLX to get over the hump to start a WATCHMAN program or is it just deeper penetration to current accounts as WATCHMAN FLX will open up kind of more procedures in different risk categories of patients? Thanks for taking the questions. Daniel Brennan : Sure, Josh. I can start on the first one, and I think, Mike, can take the second one. The good news is we do have, as you mentioned, a very well-diversified portfolio in our China business. It's not reliant on one particular business within the mix. But as our team reflects on all of what's going on there. It's pretty clear that a vast majority of the healthcare resources in China are focused on diagnosing, treating and preventing the spread of the Coronavirus and that all of the procedures are at risk of being delayed. So as we look at it, we don't say its particular division or another and that 10 to 40 contemplates the whole market basket of Boston Scientific business and the impact that we could see here in the first quarter. Michael Mahoney : Yes. And on WATCHMAN FLX, Ian or Dr. Stein can comment on it as well. But I think in terms of what we've seen in Europe, it's been more of a share taking capability that we have in Europe. And in the US, we haven't seen centers not opening, because we don't have WATCHMAN FLX. So we don't think it's going to drive the sort of new center openings that we wouldn't already receive with current WATCHMAN. I think it's -- and they can speak to the safety profile and the confidence that physicians have with FLX, which will give them more confidence to continue to increase our utilization rates, which are -- so our key metric for WATCHMAN broadly is utilization rates. We'll continue to open more centers in the US. We're expanding in Japan. We're expanding in other countries. But in the US it's all about turning on and continue to ramp up utilization, which we're seeing or we believe WATCHMAN FLX will further enhance that. Ian Meredith : I'd just add to that. I'd say the key drivers to utilization or our awareness and we're driving that through education strategies and direct to patient, direct to physician education strategies, which is highly effective. And then procedural enhancements actually increased utilization and WATCHMAN FLX is a substantial procedural enhancement in terms of being simpler to use, easier to recapture and physicians immediately recognize the some of the valuable procedural enhancements. And the third part of increasing utilization is building evidence. And I think the mere fact that we've let -- announced the CHAMPION trial a major doc  versus WATCHMAN FLX trial helps to build the awareness and therefore the utilization. So I think things will be very positive. Susan Lisa : Great. With that we'd like to conclude the call. Thanks for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in BSX.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to your Apollo Endosurgery First Quarter 2020 Results Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the floor over to Matt Kreps. Sir, the floor is yours. Matt Kreps : Thank you, and thanks everyone for participating in today's call to discuss Apollo's first quarter 2020 financial and operating results. Joining me on the call are Todd Newton, Chief Executive Officer; and Stefanie Cavanaugh, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including Apollo's financial outlook and Apollo's plans and timing for product development and sales. In addition there is uncertainty about the spread of the COVID-19 virus and the ultimate impact it may have on our operations, the demand for our products, global supply chains and economic activity in general. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties and Apollo's actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2019, as well as our most recent Form 10-Q filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast May 4, 2020. Except as required by law, Apollo undertakes no obligation to revise or update any statements reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. During this call, we will interchangeably use the term ESS for OverStitch and the term IGB for Orbera and vice-versa. With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Todd. Todd Newton : Thank you, Matt. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining today's call to discuss our first quarter 2020 results. I hope all of you joining us today and your families are safe, healthy and adapting well wherever you are. In hindsight, the first quarter of 2020 had the makings of a true breakout quarter, particularly for OverStitch in our direct markets. We had very good demand through the start of March when the COVID-19 macro disruption began. Even with the COVID-19 disruption, first quarter OverStitch sales increased 25% in the United States, and 15% in direct markets outside the United States as measured in constant currency. For Intragastric Balloons are direct market sales outside the United States, we are also trending very well in Q1, prior to the COVID-19 disruption. In the U.S., IGB sales were trending to decline by a single, - high single-digit rate before the disruption, and Stef will go further into detail on our first quarter sales shortly. As this well known to everyone on this call, in March, a number of countries, particularly countries in Europe that comprised our most important international markets and the United States implemented several public health interventions to reduce the risk of COVID-19 disease transmission and conserve healthcare resources for the anticipated community health needs from COVID-19. This resulted in an unprecedented decline in global healthcare resources available for elective or deferrable procedures including those that use our products. Patient access to treatments was also interrupted due to shelter in place and social distancing protocols resulting in cancellation or postponement of procedures. In order to preserve our balance sheet and withstand the severe disruption, the COVID-19 began to have on our business in late March and on into the second quarter, we took several aggressive cost reduction steps that have already been publicly disclosed. The initial steps we took to reduce expenses can be found in item 9B of our 10-K which was filed on March 26, subsequent actions which include a number of personnel furloughs in additional salary reduction measures were disclosed in an 8-K that we filed on April 20. One thing that is certain though, the pre COVID-19 benefits and desire to perform procedures less invasively will survive this temporary disruption to our markets. For the medical conditions impacting the gastrointestinal tract, this next level of less invasiveness is endoluminal. Whether due to gastrointestinal complications, there were no obese patients need for more palatable interventional weight loss solutions, our products and our company intend to contribute tremendously to this post COVID-19 future. I will pause with that, and turn the call over to Stefanie now to cover the first quarter financial results in greater detail. Stef? Stefanie Cavanaugh : Thank you, Todd, and good afternoon, everyone. Beginning with ESS, worldwide ESS product sales increased 5% as reported and 8% in constant currency. U.S. ESS product sales increased 25% to $3.8 million in the first quarter of 2020. Outside the U.S., ESS product sales decreased 12% as reported and 8% in constant currency to $3.1 million. While OUS direct market sales increased by close to 15% in constant currency, overall OUS, ESS sales declined due to lower sales to distributors. Certain OUS distributor orders that have been received and scheduled for shipment in March were deferred due to the distributors concern that COVID-19 would reduce second quarter procedure demand in that market. Intragastric Balloon or IGB worldwide decreased 18% as reported and 16% on a constant currency basis for the quarter reflecting soft demand in the U.S. and a $200,000 reduction OUS both of which were impacted by COVID-19 concerns. As a result, total endoscopy product sales decreased $500,000 to $10.4 million, which is a 4% reduction as reported and 2% in constant currency. ESS product sales are now 66% of total endoscopy sales in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 60% in the first quarter of 2019. Total revenues in the first quarter of last year included $2.3 million related to our former surgical product line that we sold in December of 2018. Today, our sole remaining obligation is to continue to manufacture products and this obligation will expire by the end of 2020. Gross margin for the first quarter was 53% for 2020 compared with 55% for 2019. The decline in gross margin is primarily due to the absence of surgical product sales in Q1 of 2020. Gross margin for our endoscopy products was 52% for the three months ended 31, 2020 compared to 51% for the same period of 2019. Total operating expenses in the first quarter of last year included a $5.6 million settlement gain that reduced operating expenses on a one-time basis. Excluding last year's settlement gain, total operating expenses in the first quarter of 2020 decreased $3.1 million due to reduced consumer advertising and clinical trial expenses. Similarly, after adjustment for the one-time gain in last year's first quarter results, our operating loss in the first quarter 2020 contracted by $1.5 million, or 18% to $6.7 million. Our net loss for the first quarter of 2020 was $10.3 million compared to $2.8 million for the first quarter 2019, which again benefited from the $5.6 million settlement gain. In addition, currency rate fluctuations in late March of 2020 increased net loss by $3 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to unrealized currency losses on inter-company payables. Cash at the end of the first quarter was $24 million. As Todd indicated, we have undertaken a number of aggressive actions on multiple fronts toward preserving cash. Our goal is to complete the second quarter with the same cash balance we expected before the COVID crisis. These actions included suspension of all advertising, medical education and conference activity, salary reductions across the company, productions or deferrals of our inventory purchase commitments, consolidation of our California and Australia offices into existing facilities, and the transition of our Brazilian business to a third-party distributor. In addition, in mid-April we furloughed approximately 90 of our 200 worldwide employees. From these actions, we estimate the overall cash savings in the second quarter to exceed $7 million. In closing, our Form 10-Q filed this afternoon also indicates that we were approved for an SBA loan in the amount of $2.8 million under the CARES Act. This two-year loan defers interest and principal payments until November of this year and bears interest at a rate of 1% annually. Also we disclosed an amendment to our credit agreement, which provides a waiver on minimum revenue covenants for the second and third quarter and permits the SBA loans. Together the SBA loan and the credit agreement waiver further improve liquidity and relief as we work through the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and charter pass back to normal operations as the pandemic awaits. I will now turn it back to Todd. Todd Newton : Thank you, Stefanie. Like most in our industry, we are expecting a substantial reduction procedure volumes during the second quarter. This has been our experience for April, which was very quiet but the push within our customer base to restart suggests to us that we might see sequential monthly improvement here in May and more still in June. The third quarter will likely also be down compared to the third quarter of last year and perhaps by the fourth quarter, we will see a more normal level of procedure activity. As we took the aggressive cost reduction measures step outlined to preserve capital, we have also retained flexibility to monitor the demand signals in any initial emerging customer support needs. Additionally, we are continuing to make key investments to position the Company to thrive again when the market returns to normal. I'm going to take the next couple of minutes to update you on some of these continuing efforts. First the MERIT trial continues to make progress. This nine-center prospective randomized trial comparing the Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty or ESG procedure to medically managed lifestyle management is a key piece of our reimbursement strategy for the ESG procedure and also supports label expansion. In late 2019, the investigator sites completed all level one procedures. As of this past week, more than 60% of the crossover procedures are completed. With the remaining crossovers being primarily patients resident in U.S. cities, they were hardest hit by COVID-19. In the first quarter in order to adapt to the COVID-19 situation, all MERIT trial investigator sites began to use our Apollo Care telehealth platform to support their recurring MERIT patient follow up needs. Apollo Care is our interactive telehealth tool that enables physician practices to engage with and follow the progress of their patients and the MERIT investigators determine this could be very helpful and ideal for patient follow-up, while current stay at home and shelter in place guidelines are in place and potentially beyond. Second, in 2019, Apollo provided an educational grant to the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, or the ASGE, to collaborate on the development of an Endoscopic suturing channel. This channel was launched in the first quarter and is now offered as part of the ASGE's GI Leap online learning portal. ASGE's GI Leap online learning platform is the home to all of ASGE's online educational offerings. The advanced technological features of GI Leap give the learner a modern optimal online learning experience delays the foundation for the future of GI learning. The Endoscopic suturing channel and GI Leap includes 20 procedural videos that highlight endoscopic suturing techniques across a wide variety of clinical applications in advanced GI closure, as well as revisional and primary bariatric suturing applications. In the three months this channel has been available more than 80 U.S. physicians have registered. Medical education has been a very, has been very important to our ESS success and this collaboration with the ASGE continues to advance our medical education mission. Moving forward, we see ASGE's GI Leap as an attractive virtual medical education platform to supplement our more traditional in-person medical education resources once in person training is again an option. We plan to work with ASGE to offer their endoscopic suturing content to physicians outside the United States and add robust continent to further develop the channel. Lastly, we are continuing to invest in new product development to bring the benefits of endoluminal suturing to the lower GI tract. Based on the preclinical work today, we think this offers - this will offer a meaningful advancement for better closure of complex to fix in the colon. There are two important elements of this project. First, we expect the new product will expand the addressable market for endoluminal suturing. As most of you will know our current OverStitch product portfolio is primarily used in upper GI procedures due to the length of our current product line. Within the broad GI endoscopic procedure market, upper endoscopy represents about 40% of the overall market, and thus the lower GI tract represents a significant market opportunity for us. In the U.S. alone, there are over 20 million colonoscopies performed per year and the need for the closure in the lower GI tract is as prevalent as it is in the upper GI tract. Second, it will address a very important technical need as most of you will also know our current ESS product portfolio requires that the device is attached externally to or over a flexible endoscope which is the reason the device was given the name OverStitch to begin with. For core GI applications, this requires either the physician to a planned to use suturing prior to scope insertion or it requires a physician to remove the endoscope, attach our ESS device and then re-unserved and reorient the scope, back to the area of the GI tract suturing this desire. Our new product offering is designed to provide the physician with the ability to suture through the lumen of the endoscope, and this will improve the efficiency of many core GI procedures when suturing is desired. There is always some uncertainty to a product development timeline, but we are currently of the belief that the new lower GI product has the potential to be available in the U.S. market late this year. And with that, we'll now open the lines for - to read questions-and-answer session. Christie, please proceed. Operator : Thank you. Our first group of questions comes from Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead. Matt Hewitt : I guess my first one is, when you look at the landscape today, obviously a lot has changed given from your fourth quarter earnings call. But where do things stand maybe internationally and domestically, separately, but where do those sit today versus maybe two weeks ago or a month ago. Are you starting to see some of those, particularly in international markets or some of those starting to relax their procedures and therefore you could start to see things pop back up? I know you mentioned it briefly in your prepared remarks, but where do we sit today and how do you see those opening up over the next couple of months to quarters. Todd Newton : Yes. Thanks, Matt. We are seeing, I would say, a more pragmatic approach to the return to normalcy in the U.S. market then what we're seeing at least in Europe. What we're seeing in Europe continues to be just very slow at this point. But in the U.S., we clearly are seeing a great desire especially among our physician base to give restarted. Now in some cases the reality of having new processes implemented for things like patient intake within a hospital or facility setting that those are still lagging a little bit behind the desire of the physicians to get going but that gap between the desire and the ability to get going is continuously closing over the last couple of weeks and so we are comfortable to say that in May, I think we're going to start to see some facilities again begin to do procedures. And that's particularly in the U.S. Like I said, outside the U.S., little bit slower at this point. Still, especially in Europe. Matt Hewitt : Okay, that's helpful. And then a second, one of the things that I guess as you look at the data on the coronavirus and this is globally, one of the key factors that has been shown to be - are shown to result in increased severity for the patients that receive it has been obesity and I'm curious if there is something that you're doing or that you see the potential to do from a marketing perspective, once things start to normalize. Is that something that you can, I hate to use the word capitalize on, but is that something that you can do to help before a second wave or to address the problem before next winter. Todd Newton : Well, it's a great macro question, Matt. It's a difficult one to answer, we have known for a long time and it's been demonstrated for a long time that probably the co-morbidities of obesity may drive higher cost in our health care system than any other identifiable factor that's been down for quite some time. I do hope that - if there is silver lining of the COVID-19 pandemic, it will be a - let's call it a clarifying the importance that addressing the obesity epidemic has on our total healthcare costs as a society. Matt Hewitt : Got it. And maybe one last one, then I'll hop back in the queue. Regarding the new R&D program, the new device and it's not the attachment. But what you're discussing at the end there. Is that a regular 510-K pathway or will that require PMA just help us understand, it sounds like it was the end of the year, then you're looking at just a simple 510-K, is that correct? Todd Newton : That is correct, We believe regular 510-K pathway is available for this new product. Operator : And our next set of questions comes from Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Adam Maeder : Was hoping to dig in a little bit more on Q1 just between January, February and March. Obviously with large kind of when COVID really started to impact the business, just wondering if you're able to quantify that to some degree. Just really, just hoping to get a better sense for what the impact was from COVID-19 in Q1. Todd Newton : Yes, we don't have quantitative monthly information to share with you. But what we've disclosed in our Q and we'll say again here on this call, Adam is that January and February were tracking very well to our expectations and March, we saw probably at the same time, the most of elective procedure markets saw the truncation, we saw that. That was probably around the second week of March that we started to feel that in earnest right around the time of the World Health Organization announcements and of course, the President's national declaration of the State Emergency here in the United States that tracks really well with when we started to see a pullback on elective procedures. So January, February were great. March really saw it begin to slow down and slowed down fast. Adam Maeder : Okay. I appreciate the color there. And then I guess as it relates to just the near-term cost-cutting efforts for Q2. I understand you want to be judicious with cash. But do you see any potential impact to your business from a competitive standpoint over the next three, six, 12 months from the lack of spend and then just put the furloughing of employees. Any more color there, is it manufacturing, is it sales force and just how quickly can you bring those folk back online and then I just had one more follow-up. Thanks. Todd Newton : Yes. Any need time that you go through a cost cutting exercise, you're weighing long-term and short-term goals sometimes against each other. Nonetheless, we felt like that the actions we need to take in order to maintain our liquidity were the right actions to take. We have a technology that we feel like is very unique and different in the marketplace, so we're not really competing against another endoluminal suturing device, and as a result as we've talked about I think in the past, Adam our customers are - customers who are - who like the technology, very much and like to use it in their practice. So we waive those things and felt like the right course of action was nonetheless the short-term actions that we took and we'll figure out the longer-term consequences as we go. In terms of the where the personnel reside, it was basically across the entire spectrum. Adam Maeder : Okay, got it. That's very clear and just for my last question, OUS Orbera sales were pretty solid, all things considered and ahead of our expectations. I'm just curious and sorry if I missed this in the prepared remarks, what drove the strength in that business outside the U.S. in Q1. And just I guess looking ahead, how do you think about the Balloon business in subsequent quarters just given that it is cash pay. Just any color there would be helpful. Thanks again. Todd Newton : Yes. And so our Orbera business outside the United States is a very well established solid business. We enjoy in various different markets, aspects of reimbursement for the Orbera device that we don't have in the U.S. or in the U.S. is probably be considered fully cash pay, it's not necessarily considered fully cash pay in Europe, especially in certain markets. So it's been a good franchise for us and continues to be stable and we would anticipate that coming out of this COVID-19 situation that the Orbera franchise outside the United States will continue to be a very stable business for us. Operator : And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I will turn it back over to management for any closing remarks. Todd Newton : Well, thank you, Christie. And thank you everyone for joining us today on the call. Stefanie is of course disappointed she didn't get chance to answer any question directly, but should you have any questions or would like to arrange a call with us, please contact Matt Kreps of Darrow Associates. Stay safe everyone, and thank you again. Operator : And that does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a great day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. I'd like to remind you that this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Matt Kreps, Managing Director at Darrow Associates Investor Relations. Mr. Kreps, you may begin. Matt Kreps : Thank you, Taren, and thanks, everyone, for participating in today's call to discuss Apollo's second quarter 2020 financial and operating results. Joining me on the call today are Todd Newton, Chief Executive Officer; and Stefanie Cavanaugh, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including Apollo's financial outlook and Apollo's plans and timing for product development and sales. In addition, there is uncertainty about the spread of the COVID-19 virus, and the ultimate impact it may have on our operations, the demand for our products, global supply chains and economic activity in general. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2019, as well as our most recent Form 10-Q filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, August 4, 2020. Except as required by law, Apollo undertakes no obligation to revise or update any statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. During this call, we will interchangeably use the term ESS for OverStitch and the term IGB for Orbera and vice versa. And with that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Newton : Thank you, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call to discuss our second quarter 2020 results. I hope all of you joining us today and your families are remaining safe and healthy. On July 20, we preannounced our second quarter revenue and highlights. And in just a moment, Stefanie Cavanaugh, our CFO, will take you through the details of the second quarter. Before she does, I will open with four key points that best describe for investors, the state of the company here at the midway point of 2020. One, the immediate liquidity preservation actions we took at the start of the COVID disruption were successful. These decisions were hard to make and hard to implement because of the impact on our team. But we knew that the actions were necessary to preserve the interest of our shareholders, and the Board of Directors fully supported management's plans. Two, we have made sacrifices to reduce spend, but we have continued to pursue shareholder value creation by investing in our most important development programs such as the X-Tack program. This took tremendous teamwork and adaptation due to stay-at-home directives and travel restrictions, but our team persevered. And as announced on July 7, the X-Tack 510k application was submitted to the FDA and now in the regulatory review process. Three, our business is coming back. The COVID pandemic had an immediate and significant impact on all health care procedures, and, of course, it impacted our sales in the second quarter. But since March and April initial shutdown of elective procedures, we have been on a positive recovery path. In June, U.S. product sales were close to 90% of June sales in 2019. Our recovery trends outside the United States are also encouraging, but tracking slower in June than the U.S. pace. Four, our liquidity has been shored up. While COVID-related market risk continues to cloud the immediate future with uncertainty, our recently completed equity financing and simultaneous credit amendment provides us the capital to accelerate our business recovery from this period of COVID market disruption and fund through the X-Tack launch. I will pause with that and turn the call over to Stephanie now to cover the second quarter financial results in greater detail. Stef? Stefanie Cavanaugh : Thank you, Todd, and good afternoon, everyone. As addressed in our press release from earlier today and the 10-Q filing, the dominant theme in the second quarter has been the COVID-19 disruption to health care resources and elective or deferrable procedure volumes worldwide, including procedures that use our products. As a result, our revenue decreased 60% in the second quarter of 2020 from the second quarter of 2019. By geography. U.S. endoscopy sales declined 40%, while OUS endoscopy sales declined close to 68%. The difference in geographic decline is that the U.S. procedure volumes and health care activity appears to be recovering at a quicker rate, and the OUS decline includes our distributor channel, which was down by 76% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Both ESS and IGB worldwide sales were affected by COVID-19. As a result, total endoscopy product sales were $5.4 million, which is a 56% reduction. Foreign currency movements in the quarter did not materially affect revenue trends. The proportion of the ESS product sales to total endoscopy product sales were 67% in the second quarter of 2020, which is roughly equivalent to its share of sales back in the second quarter of 2019. Total revenues in the second quarter of last year also included $1.9 million in transition service revenues related to our former surgical product line that we sold in December of 2018, while transition services were only $200,000 in the second quarter of this year. We expect to be completely free of any remaining service obligations by the end of 2020. Gross margin for the second quarter was 43% compared with 50% for the second quarter of 2019. The liquidity preservation program we implemented at the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a series of postponements and cancellations of inventory purchases. And we also reduced our production plan to align our inventory with the expected decline in product demand. These efforts idled our production facilities for a large portion of the second quarter and resulted in a direct charge of $0.5 million to cost of sales in the period. Without this charge for unabsorbed overhead in the second quarter, our gross margin would have been comparable to the second quarter of last year and more consistent with our pre-COVID gross margin percentage expectations. Total operating expenses were $6.7 million or more than 50% reduced compared to the second quarter of 2019 due to cost savings initiatives the management team implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As we have discussed, we undertook a number of aggressive actions at the beginning of the pandemic to preserve cash. Our goal was to complete the second quarter with the same net cash use we expected before the COVID crisis, and we met this goal. We will continue to closely manage cash during the remainder of the COVID-19 disruption to maintain a balance between our cash commitments and business improvements. Descriptions of these cost savings initiatives were detailed in our past shareholder periodic reports on Form 10-K for 2019 and 10-Q for the first quarter of 2020 and the Form 8-K dated April 20. Our operating loss in the second quarter of 2020 decreased 40% to $4.3 million from $7.2 million in the second quarter of 2019. Similarly, our net loss for the second quarter of 2020 improved to $6.3 million compared to $8.8 million for the second quarter of 2019, an improvement of 29%. Cash at the end of the second quarter was $19.7 million, and we were in compliance with our credit agreement. Subsequent to quarter end, on July 21, we completed the transaction to sell common stock and prefunded warrants for total gross proceeds of $25 million. Concurrently, we modified our existing loan agreement to waive any minimum revenue covenant requirement for the remainder of 2020 and decreased our minimum liquidity requirement that was set to increase to $20 million this quarter, down to $12.5 million. The combination of these two transactions increased our liquidity by $32.5 million and greatly reduces our COVID-19 near-term market risk. The length of the runway from these transactions somewhat depends on the pace at which our business continues to improve from COVID-19. But in any event, we expect, as of today, that our liquidity will be sufficient to get us past this year's 2020 disruption through the readout of the MERIT trial in 2021 and fund the X-Tack launch in 2021 as well. I will now turn it back to Todd. Todd Newton : Thank you, Stefanie. The first half of this year has been an unprecedented, unpredictable and difficult period for everyone. But Apollo Endosurgery has tremendous opportunities in front of us, and these opportunities are the management team's focus. The equity raise that we just completed, which was entirely funded by existing shareholders, is a testament to the support and belief of our current shareholder base in these opportunities. And I'll highlight three of these opportunities today. First, core GI use has been an important part of our OverStitch growth story, particularly in the United States. We've spoken for a while now of the goal to bring the benefits of flexible endoscopic suturing to core GI needs in the lower GI track, especially the colon. And this is what X-Tack is designed for. During our development labs, doctor feedback has been very positive. The feature that stands out is it's through the scope delivery designed to work with any 2.8 millimeter or larger working channel, which includes any of the leading gastroscopes or colonoscopes on the market. Advanced endoscopists, like those who use OverStitch today will find it distinctive with broad case application. Every endoscopist should find it easier to pick up and use and economical. It is specifically designed to easily and effectively close larger or irregularly shaped defects, which would otherwise be very challenging for the endoscopist to address with the existing closure devices in the market. X-Tack should also be a very good fit with our sales organization. Our top 100 OverStitch accounts in the United States where we generated 80% of our U.S. OverStitch sales last year, and we think there will be strong core GI demand for X-Tack at more than 75% of these same top 100 accounts. The range of use for X-Tack runs from being a rescue tool for acute perforations on one end of the spectrum to the prophylactic closure following a mid to large-sized polyp removal for patients at higher risk of delayed bleeding because of either polyp size, location or the need to use anti-thrombotic medications being at the other end of the spectrum and many uses in between. X-Tack will materially expand our addressable market in core GI. With more than 20 million colonoscopies performed each year in the United States, X-Tack moves us into a large and important market where our existing customers have an existing unmet need that X-Tack will address. If typical 510k processing time is a guide, we believe that X-Tack could be cleared by the end of this year. Second, we have substantial bariatric growth potential still ahead. The bariatric procedure market is a roughly 200,000 procedure per year market in the United States alone and the endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty, or ESG procedure, that is enabled by the full-thickness suturing capabilities of OverStitch, has a very attractive value proposition for patients, physicians and the health care system at large due to its effectiveness, low adverse event rate and ease to revise when revision is needed. While bariatrics have been an important part of our OverStitch past growth as has core GI, we have yet to tap the potential of ESG. The ESG procedure continues to build momentum worldwide and we estimate that there were probably somewhere around 5,000 ESG procedures performed worldwide last year. But data generation is required to break into a bigger share of the bariatric market or to grow the market. And the MERIT trial, which we've spoken about many times before, is intended to provide this data. As a reminder, MERIT is a randomized prospective multicenter trial being conducted at various sites in the United States to study the effectiveness and safety of the ESG procedure and is a key piece of our reimbursement strategy for the ESG procedure and label expansion for OverStitch. We remain very confident that the MERIT study will achieve its goals. And the reason for our optimism is simple. ESG has already been studied and reported on multiple times by multiple centers with highly consistent results across the globe. In 2019 there were there were three meta-analysis published, the pooled the results of over 1,700 patient experiences. Some of the MERIT site activities experienced some COVID-19-related delays. But as of last week, less than 10 crossover procedures remain to be performed. The PIs anticipate the primary MERIT data readout by the middle of 2021. And with reimbursement, we believe the ESG procedure will be disruptive to today's bariatric marketplace. Third, expanding physician access to our products remains a priority for us. COVID-19 has disruptive travel and many of the planned in-person physician meetings we have historically leveraged to address medical education demand. However, there remains a strong physician interest to learn more about OverStitch, and we have found alternative ways to address this interest. In the second quarter, we held two international webinars on the benefits of endoluminal suturing. The first webinar focused on the benefits of endoluminal suturing as part of the core GI basket of procedures and was attended by 300 persons. The second discussed endoluminal bariatric suturing applications, and that was attended by almost 500 participants. At the end of July, we also hosted two didactic training sessions here in the United States. Again, one for bariatric and one on core GI, designed as precursors to hands on training activity. We had more than 80 registrants for each of these classes. And subsequently conducted our first in-person lab training session since the beginning of COVID just this past Friday to test how we might reopen the hands-on aspects of our education programs. As normalcy returns, the level of engagement we have seen on our virtual platforms makes us feel confident that new user interest will be as high as we were experiencing pre COVID. Expanding physician interest to our products goes beyond medical education note. In 2019, we launched the SX OverStitch device as part of the strategy to avail our suturing technology to those physicians or account locations that did not have access to a dual-channel endoscope. Since that launch, about a third of all new OverStitch accounts globally are SX users. And by the end of this year, we will be making minor modifications to further improve the user experience with SX. In addition, during the second quarter of this year and despite COVID, our regulatory team succeeded in securing market approvals or clearances for one or more of our endoscopic products in seven countries. These new markets will be served by either new or existing third-party distributors. Regulatory efforts are ongoing inside of Apollo to further expand the availability of our products to new markets. Indeed, we have multiple growth drivers ahead for our business following COVID-19 recovery. I want to say a couple of words as well about our gross margin improvement programs. These remain important, but had to be put on hold as part of our liquidity preservation program. Of course, we kept X-Tack moving forward. And X-Tack is probably our most important gross margin improvement project as we expect X-Tack at its launch to be accretive to our overall gross margin. We will resume other gross margin improvement projects as our business recovery and organizational bandwidth dictates as reasonable. Finally, a soft outlook for the third quarter ahead. Our team has built a solid growing business. This business is coming back as quickly as elective procedures are allowed to come back. In the United States, in the second quarter, we had very good recovery in the Mid-Atlantic, in Southeast as well as the Southwest and Western states. Still the Northeast area of the United States, where we have a sizable business, was severely hit by COVID-19 and slower to recover during the second quarter. And outside the United States, direct markets such as Germany, Spain and Italy showed good signs of recovery throughout the second quarter, while the United Kingdom and France trailed behind. Some of our larger distributor markets, such as the Middle East, have yet to show signs of recovery. But overall, we like what we are seeing so far in the third quarter based on July from both OverStitch and Orbera. In July, our direct market endoscopy product sales both in the United States and outside the United States increased compared to July of 2019. In fact, if we had June and July of 2020 together, our direct markets endoscopy product sales increased compared to those same two months in 2019. The third quarter is traditionally a seasonally soft quarter, but all indications right now are that the third quarter sales will be sequentially up compared to the second quarter. However, much COVID risks remain and we are still planning for the third quarter to be below the third quarter of last year. And by the end of the fourth quarter, perhaps, we'll see a return to pre-COVID procedure levels. With that, we'll now open the lines up for questions. Taren, please proceed. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please go ahead, sir. Matt Hewitt : Good afternoon and thanks for the update and for taking the questions. Todd Newton : Good afternoon Matt. Matt Hewitt : Maybe on the first one regarding the rebound that you've seen May to June, and now it sounds like through July, how much of that is just kind of getting back -- or getting through the backlog that was created in late March and April versus new pipeline opportunities for your GI customers? And maybe what does that pipeline look like today if you have any thoughts there? Todd Newton : Yes. It's a good question, Matt. It's one of the uncertainties, I think, I would say, right now, as we look at our business is knowing to what degree have we been dealing with backlog, especially in June and July, versus to what degree we are really back to more of a normal health care utilization pattern. Undoubtedly, we have concerns, as do others, that higher unemployment rates and loss of insurance potentially can impact beyond the current backlog that we see right now, could impact recovery rates in the latter half of this year. So it's a good question, very difficult to answer. It's one of the reasons why we still are anticipating that even though July has been really a very satisfactory month, we still anticipate that the third quarter will likely be below the third quarter of last year. And it'll be a little bit longer before we see a return to pre-COVID procedure levels. We hope that we're being too conservative. Matt Hewitt : That's helpful. Thank you and then one of the risk -- the key risk categories for coronavirus patients is obesity. There's been a number of tweets from some of your customers talking about seeing an incremental demand once the lockdown orders were lifted for ESG and for other bariatric procedures. I'm just curious, is that something that you think could become a little bit of a tailwind here? I realize it's a tough environment, but given that risk factor, is that -- does that create opportunities for you? Todd Newton : Matt, it's a good question again. I think our opportunities were always exceedingly large in the bariatric marketplace. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, this is a market of 200,000 procedures per year in the United States, and we haven't even tapped it in any meaningful way. This is, of course, the whole investment thesis behind the MERIT study. And our goal is reimbursement. And if the market grows as a result of the higher COVID risk factors associated with obese patients, that is something we aspire to help address. But we just see that the bariatric market pre-COVID was already a very attractive market for us and one worth pursuing and one that, once we are able to tap into it and compete on a reimbursed basis, I think we're going to see tremendous growth potential arise. Matt Hewitt : Okay. Great. And then one last one, I'll hop back into queue. The in-person training that you spoke about in your prepared remarks, was that in a customer facility? Or was that using your mobile lab? And I would think that you'd be able to control that mobile lab environment maybe a little bit better than even one of your customers' facilities. Is that something that you're looking to exploit, I guess, at least over the near term when there's still coronavirus circulating? Todd Newton : Well, what I mentioned that was conducted on Friday. That was actually done at a lab in Chicago at the ASGE. They have a fantastic facility. And I think this was actually their first training course that they hosted at that facility since the beginning of COVID as well as ours. So we've enjoyed always a really good relationship with physician societies, such as the ASGE, and we've always had very good success with their facility, which is just a top-notch facility. We have yet to turn back on, so to speak, the mobile lab, and we're going to be continuing to evaluate that here in the second half of the year. Matt Hewitt : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead, sir. Andrew Stafford : Hi guys this is Drew on for Adam. Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on a nice quarter. I was wondering if you could speak a little bit to either quantitatively or qualitatively, some of the mindset of your customers, given that you guys have a sizable cash pay exposure. You mentioned a couple of things on the previous question that feel a little more cautious as far as insurance or the financial health of some of your customers. But just to be clear, is that something you're hearing at all so far? And then just any patient concerns as far as coming in due to COVID? Todd Newton : Yes. Let me take the first part of your question, and you may have to repeat the second part of your question, I'm not sure I heard it, Drew. But the prominent, let's call it, message from customers throughout the second quarter, lesser so now, but throughout the second quarter was that they just wanted to get back to work. And it really had more to do with them than it had to do with anything related to us or our procedures. It was just a desire to get back to work. But there was a large need to address things such as patient intake procedures and how to keep the hospital or ambulatory surgical environment secure from this highly contagious situation. And so we've had for some time a communication from our customers that they were ready to go and get started. And so I think what is interesting right now is that while Q3 tends to be a seasonal period that is somewhat lower than Q2, because of that period of disruption, I think we're hearing more from accounts that they plan to continue working through the third quarter at rates that perhaps in the past, would not have been typical. In the past, maybe they would have taken more vacation in August because that's seasonally what is done. But right now, I think our -- the things we're hearing in the marketplace suggests that procedures may continue to move forward, although probably because of these intake type of safeguards that have been put in place at a lot of places, capacity may be slightly reduced. Andrew Stafford : Okay. That make sense. Todd Newton : And what was the second part of your question, Drew, I missed it? Andrew Stafford : Yes. So the second part of the question was just more on the patient side. Are you hearing at all from your customers that some of their patients are concerned about coming in due to COVID? I mean, I think, based on your answer to your previous question, I think the answer is no, but anything on the patient side would be helpful, too. Todd Newton : Yes. I think I'll just go with your answer, Drew, no. That's a good answer. Stefanie Cavanaugh : That's what we're experiencing. Andrew Stafford : Okay. That's very helpful. And then congrats on the submission for X-Tack. It sounds like it could be pretty complementary to some of your products. Forgive me if I missed this, but assuming you get approval in a couple of months down the road, what can we expect as far as a full or a limited launch probably late this year or early next? And then from a sales model perspective, is there a bundling opportunity into some of those large accounts you spoke about? Stefanie Cavanaugh : So I'll start with our launch plans at this point. We believe if everything progresses with -- at the normal rate of the 510k submission that we will have approval by the end of this year, late this year. And so at that point, we will begin a limited launch that we would expect to carry forward with a small group of people for a couple of months. And then when we have our national sales meeting in the middle-ish of the first quarter, we would then begin a full launch and roll out our lessons learned from that limited launch experience through to our full sales force. As far as a bundling opportunity, I'm not aware of any discussion along those lines. Todd Newton : No, I don't -- yes. I think on bundling. We have two products that are very innovative. And so there would seem to be less need. Let me reuse that word, less need for us to consider bundling in order to improve access. So I don't anticipate that right now, but we'll be looking at pricing strategies as we continue to get closer to this point in time when we can introduce the product to the market. Andrew Stafford : Okay. That makes complete sense. Just one more quick one from me here. Just on the expense side, obviously, you took some chunks out of the business, due to COVID particularly on the sales and marketing portion, how quickly should we think about some of that investment return to the business as a recovery happens here? And then, I guess, with the recent capital raise, do you feel like you're in a good place to go on the offensive right away? Or do you kind of stay in cash preservation mode until there's a little bit more clarity with COVID. Thank you for taking the questions. Stefanie Cavanaugh : Thank you, Adam. Appreciate the question. How quickly our expenses come back will be entirely gated by how quickly our revenue comes back. So we will be very judicious in returning our expenses across the board for furloughed employees, salary reductions as well as sales and marketing activities to match that to what our revenue return looks like. So that would be how I would counsel you there in your thought process. And we're watching it daily -- weekly in order to make the right decisions for that effect. From our liquidity perspective, we are very pleased with the equity we just raised, and we see that giving us a nice runway through this disruption, the end of this year and helping us fund our X-Tack launch and getting us through the MERIT readout sometime in 2021. So our risk has been significantly decreased. Stefanie Cavanaugh : Thank you Adam. Operator : [Technical Difficulty] My apologies. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'll now turn the floor back over to Mr. Newton. Sir, the floor is yours. Todd Newton : Well, thank you, Taren. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today on the call. And should you have any questions or would like to arrange a call to have questions asked, please contact Matt Kreps at Darrow Associates. We also plan to participate in several investor conferences during the third quarter, all virtual for the moment. And these include the LD Micro event in early September on September 1 through September 4 and the H.C. Wainwright Conference in September on the 14th and through the 16th and potentially others. So we would welcome a chance to visit with one of you as part of those events. And so please contact Matt again if you would like to request a meeting. Stay safe, everyone, and thank you again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a great day.",

After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note, this event is being recorded. Susan Lisa : Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q3 2020 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials & Filings. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately an hour. Mike will focus his comments on Q3 performance, inclusive of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as future catalysts and the general outlook for our business. Dan will review the financials for the quarter, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ian Meredith and Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and organic revenue further excludes the impact of certain acquisitions, including BTG through August 15, as there are no prior period related net sales, as well as the divestitures of the global embolic microspheres portfolio and the Intrauterine Health Franchise. On this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified, are organic. Finally, average daily sales, ADS, normalizes sales growth for a difference in selling days year-over-year. Of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic upon the company's operations and financial results, statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Q filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. Michael Mahoney : Thanks, Susie. And thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we made significant progress in third quarter, with excellent commercial execution and strong clinical adoption across our category-leading portfolio, as we build new capabilities and fuel our new product launch cadence. We continue to invest in our promising future and are confident that this will enable us to continue to grow at the high end of our peer group, improve operating margins and deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth and strong free cash flow for the long term. In the third quarter, operational sales declined 2.5%, and organic sales declined 5.7%, normalizing for currency and the divestiture of both our Intrauterine Health business and Legacy B's  business, as well as excluding the contribution of BTG through August 15. Importantly, note that the organic revenue result include a negative 230 basis point impact related to sales return reserves in the quarter as we strategically shifted to a consignment based model for our left atrial appendage closure franchise with the launch of our next-generation WATCHMAN FLX device in the US. I'll provide more detail on the strategy and the success of the WATCHMAN FLX launch in a bit. I now offer highlights of our performance of third quarter '20. Every region and every business segment improved sequentially versus second quarter, and many countries returned to year-over-year growth in third quarter. Regional performance improved significantly. It was very consistent around the globe. US sales declined 4%. Europe, Middle East, Africa also declined 3% and Asia Pac declined 4%. We delivered growth in China for the second consecutive quarter, plus 2% growth in the third quarter on an organic basis. This China growth includes a negative 770 basis point impact from sales return reserves for channel inventory adjustments in anticipation to becoming a national tender in drug-eluting stents in fourth quarter.  China has strong sales in Complex PCI, including Imaging, Rhythm management, Intervention, Structural Heart and urology public health, and our swift progress diversifying the portfolio into these high-growth markets means that DES will represent approximately 10% of our China revenue in 2020. We expect our China business to accelerate growth in the fourth quarter, and we are targeting double-digit growth in 2021, including the DES tender related impact. This regional sales performance was mirrored with a balanced and sharp recovery across our business units. Daniel Brennan : Thanks, Mike. Third quarter consolidated revenue of $2.659 billion, represents a reported revenue decline of 1.8% and reflecting $19 million tailwind from foreign exchange. On an operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, revenue declined 2.5% in the quarter. BTG sales contributed 370 basis points prior to becoming organic on August 15, partially offset by the divestitures of our legacy embolic beads portfolio and Intrauterine Health business. Excluding the net contribution of acquisitions and divestitures, organic revenue declined 5.7%, and includes a $63 million or 230 basis point headwind from the sales return reserve related to our conversion to a consignment inventory model for our WATCHMAN franchise, with the launch of our next-generation WATCHMAN FLX device here in the United States. These sales results represent strong sequential improvement over the second quarter as procedural volumes continue to trend upward through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A rebounding top line and continued P&L discipline contributed to our Q3 adjusted earnings per share of $0.37, along with a $0.06 tax benefit, which was partially offset by a negative $0.04 impact from the WATCHMAN consignment sales return reserve. Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 69.3%, in line with our expectations to approach 70% in the back half of the year, as we outlined on the Q2 call. The sequential improvement is driven by lower negative manufacturing variances, slightly offset by the impact of the transition to WATCHMAN consignment. As a reminder, Q2 production levels were below 75% of capacity resulting in material manufacturing variances that were expensed within the P&L in that quarter. In Q3, with production levels above 75% in the majority of our plants, unfavorable manufacturing variances deceased and were capitalized within inventory on the balance sheet and will be recognized over a 6 month period corresponding to our inventory turns. Looking forward, we continue to expect Q4 adjusted gross margin to be in line with Q3 approaching 70%. Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 23.4% or 25.1%, excluding a 170 basis point headwind related to the WATCHMAN consignment transition. This is slightly ahead of our expectations given the trajectory of our revenue recovery in the quarter and continued P&L discipline. We increased investment spending, while maintaining prudent adjusted SG&A and adjusted R&D rates of 35.9% and 9.5%, respectively. Q3 also had some favorability related to timing and investment spend will continue to increase throughout the fourth quarter. Based on these results, we expect Q4 adjusted operating margin to be similar to Q3, excluding the impact of WATCHMAN consignment in both quarters. On a GAAP basis, operating margin was negative 7.7%, and includes a $219 million intangible asset impairment, primarily related to Apama and a $260 million litigation-related expense. As Mike detailed, we've discontinued the development of the Apama RF balloon, and I'll provide an update on our legal reserve shortly. Moving below the line, our expectations for full year adjusted interest and other expense have not changed from our Q2 call to be slightly above the range of $400 million to $425 million provided at the beginning of the year. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 31.7% on a GAAP basis and minus 3.5% on an adjusted basis, which includes an $88 million non-cash benefit, driven by this quarter's completion of the IRS examination of our 2014 to 2016 tax years in a favorable position compared to our reserves. This resulted in a $0.06 benefit to adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $870 million, and reported free cash flow was $595 million, driven by strong operating margins and improved working capital efficiency. As of September 30, 2020, we had cash on hand of $2 billion. Total liquidity, including available credit facilities of $4.8 billion and a prudent debt maturity profile with no near term maturities. During the quarter, we prepaid the remaining $250 million balance on our February 2021 term loan. This leaves us with no debt maturities until May of 2022. The capital expenditures for the third quarter were $49 million. We continue to expect full year 2020 capital expenditures of approximately $350 million as we focus on certain plant expansions and projects to meet capacity needs and drive value improvement programs. With respect to our legal reserves, we booked $260 million in Q3, primarily related to mesh, inclusive of a reserve related to onetime claims made by a coalition of state attorneys general. Year-to-date, we have made cash payments of $30 million into qualified settlement funds, leaving approximately $85 million remaining to fund outstanding individual plaintiffs claims. We ended Q3 with $1.445 billion of fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding and expect approximately 1.447 billion for the fourth quarter 2020 and 1.432 billion for the full year 2020. In closing, our businesses and pipeline remain very strong, and our long-term fundamentals have not changed, with targeted organic revenue growth at the high end of our peers, sustained adjusted operating margin expansion, double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth and strong free cash flow. Please check our investor relations website for Q3 2020 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more detailed Q3 results. And with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A. Susan Lisa : Thanks, Dan. Andrew, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Andrew, please go ahead. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Lewis : Great. Well, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just got one for Mike and then a follow-up related for Dan. So Mike, I just want to come back to this high-end device comment you made. So I just want to confirm that whatever the MedTech peers grow, let's say, that's 4% to 5%, you inspire to grow 3 points faster. And then, also for you, I think it's a concern in light of CRM and IC market dynamics or TAVR that the ability to do that, frankly, has changed. So clearly, people are focusing on the things that have gotten below plan. Maybe you could maybe focus on some of the pieces of the business or segments that are above plan that are giving you the confidence that, that algorithm of 3 points above 4% to 5% or whatever have - you have is still achievable? And then I have a follow-up for Dan. Michael Mahoney : Good morning, David. Thanks for the question. Yeah, we're very confident in our ability to continue to grow at the high end of our peer group. We've done so for a number of years and our product launch cadence as we look to round out \u201820 and 2021 are quite exciting. Now if you look across our businesses and our launch schedule, we've highlighted WATCHMAN FLX, and we laid out at TCT, why we believe the WATCHMAN FLX market is larger than originally anticipated. And based on the increase in utilization that we're seeing, we see that as a multibillion-dollar market. So I don't want to go across every business, but we have a very strong product launch cadence. We talked about in PI with both the Eluvia stent and the pending approval for Ranger. We're seeing excellent growth out of our Interventional Oncology business, led by BTG, which actually grew upper single digits in the quarter and really the strength of our MedSurg businesses. Our Endo business, with the launch of our single use scopes, the momentum of our urology business. And we have two big launches in neuromod in Europe in both SCS and DBS, where we continue to take share. So really across the portfolio, we have a rich bag of product launches. Clearly, we would have liked to have the ACURATE neo approval prior to 2024. And that's certainly something that we wish we could pull in, and we'll continue to try that based on our discussions with the FDA. But if you look at just the incremental tailwind of WATCHMAN growth and paclitaxel, we believe those two elements there neutralize the slight delay with ACURATE neo on its own. So we have a history of growing above market, and the product launch cadence we have is strong. And our VC portfolio is quite good. And the free cash flow and balance sheet to deploy against that is very strong. David Lewis : Okay. Very helpful, Mike. And then, Dan, just for you, I appreciate the confirmation of growing in fourth quarter. Should we assume that growth in the fourth quarter is kind of low single digit type growth? And then look, \u201821, I know we're not going to get a lot idea here, but everyone is very focused on \u201821 as a percent of 2019. Streets at double-digit growth for next year. I wonder if maybe you'd comment on kind of the reality of those numbers, but more specifically, any parameters you can offer us on \u201821 on the top, bottom line tax margins for consideration of our models as we head into next year? Thanks so much. Daniel Brennan : Sure, David. So relative to Q4, the commentary is just very simple. It's aimed to grow. So we haven't given specific guidance relative to a number, whether it be one number or another. So the commentary and our belief is that we're aiming to grow in the fourth quarter, obviously, with the COVID caveats that Mike mentioned. With respect to 2021, I probably can't give you a lot of detail on that. We're right in the middle of our annual operating plan process right now, except to say that, again, as I mentioned, closing out my prepared commentary that it's really the same goals we've always had, which is to grow at the high end of the peers to expand operating margin and to deliver double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. So really no change there. We're working through the process, and the goal would be, when we get to the February call to give you a sense of where we are and let you know what we think 2021 might hold. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Hopkins of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Robert Hopkins : Thanks and good morning. Can you hear me, okay? Michael Mahoney : Good morning, Bob. Daniel Brennan : Hear you fine, Bob. Robert Hopkins : Good morning, great. Thanks so much. So to start, I apologize for the short-term oriented question. But Mike, I was wondering if you could just comment on the degree to which the pretty significant global flare-up of COVID in the last few weeks has impacted the business. And therefore, how confident are you in that comment on fourth quarter that you offer at WATCHMAN? Michael Mahoney : Sure. So we - obviously, you've seen an uptick globally. Everyone reads the newspapers there. I would say the hospitals are doing an amazing job of managing COVID while still performing elective procedures. So you've seen that with the sequential growth that we've had in the third quarter. We're certainly mindful of the fourth quarter of potential interruptions there. So our goal is to aim to return and grow ex-WATCHMAN. But we're obviously watching COVID quite significant like everyone else's. And we continue to see month-over-month improvement in our trends, but we put a caveat there in the fourth quarter as we aim to, excluding WATCHMAN and obviously, if the COVID dramatically improves \u2013 increases, and there is more shutdowns and more pressures on the hospital system that, that could impact the fourth quarter. But so far, we've seen nice improvement sequentially month-over-month. Hospitals doing better job managing it, and patients need the care that products like Boston Scientific our peers provide. We're also obviously managing our spend, and you saw the strong improvement in our operating income margins in the third quarter and the drop-through in EPS. So we expect that trend to continue. Robert Hopkins : Okay. Great. And then just one product comment. Could you just remind me what you said on WATCHMAN in the quarter? I think you said \u2013 did you say it grew double-digits? Just curious, it sounds like you saw a very rapid recovery in WATCHMAN over the course of the quarter. Just wondering if we get any more specifics or details? Thank you. Michael Mahoney : Yes, it did grow double-digits in third quarter. And it's really \u2013 it's been just an excellent launch. The early results have been very good. And as I mentioned in the script, we aim with this consignment model to switch the majority \u2013 high majority of our customers over by year end and complete that by second quarter. And that consignment model shift, we think, is a smart move because it gets FLX in the hands of our operators, which they want, allows us to tie up longer term \u2013 highly committed share contracts at an appropriate price premium. So the launch is going extremely well, and it bounced back very quickly in third quarter, growing double-digits. Robert Hopkins : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Mike, maybe getting back to a bigger picture question on the algorithm here, double-digit earnings algorithm. One, perhaps, could you give us an update on BTG? I think the last update was 5 or 6 decretion  with synergies coming in better where we are in BTG? And when you look at that 2021, I guess, the double-digit EPS, is the right base 2019, I'm curious because the deals annualize here and it's included in the 2020 numbers and streets modeling close to 18%, 19% revenue growth for next year. It seems a little excess, but any comments, I think, would be helpful. Daniel Brennan : Sure. Vijay, this is Dan. I can start and Mike can add in certainly as well. Relative to BTG, I think we're potentially even more committed to the benefits of that deal now than we were when we did it. If you look at the growth, one of the highlights in the quarter, and Mike mentioned it, when you pro forma for the various pieces within interventional medicines, they were all in high single digits. And so that's obviously accretive to where we are, and that's in the middle of a global dynamic. So a lot of good hopes for that. Mike also mentioned on the BTG synergies that we had talked about $175 million in total synergies, well, now we're at $125 million, we believe, exiting 2020. We believe that we'll get that whole $175 million in total out of cost. So the revenue synergies that we had planned will actually be upside. So we look at BTG as a nice driver for us going forward. Relative to comps, I think, the most relevant comp is going to end up being 2019. I mean, 2020, we will compare to that, obviously, but it's a different year. I'm not going to comment on the specific numbers that are out there relative to your revenue growth for 2021, but I think when you look at it, it will be 2021 versus 2019, that will be the most relevant comparison, I think, we have. Vijay Kumar : Got you. And then, maybe on structural hearts here. Mike, maybe just comment on Scope 2, does it matter? I mean, the stocks have reacted post-ECT, but it feels like with that neo2, it shouldn't matter. Perhaps could you talk about what structural thought should look like for Boston within Europe? Michael Mahoney : Sure. Dr. Meredith can make some additional comments. But we just \u2013 are launching scope - our neo2 platform right now. And so that, obviously, as you know, is our second-gen platform, as shown in our EU study that Ian or Dr. Meredith can further comment on. It\u2019s got improved PVL rates, very low pacemaker rates, very good hemodynamics. And it's our second-generation valve. And the enrollment in the U.S. is going quite well for that system. So we're quite bullish on ACURATE neo2 in Europe. And we're hoping as COVID, as we're hopefully in the second half here of COVID overall, that we\u2019ll continue to accelerate the trialing in the US for that platform. So we'll continue to reiterate that platform, and we're confident that the European team will deliver strong results in \u201821 with ACURATE neo2. Ian Meredith : Yeah. Thanks, Mike, just to reinforce your comments. I think you heard the panel discussion, Vijay, at TCT and most of the physicians on the panel recognized that this is comparison of the first generation versus a third-generation product as a comparison for Scope 2. Most physicians who had significant experience with the ACURATE neo platform know how to use it appropriately. They recognize that ACURATE neo2 has a 60% larger skirt  and significantly improved PVL performance in independent core and adjudicated data sets. So I don't think it's going to influence scope, the use of ACURATE neo2. Vijay Kumar : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow-up on TAVR. Actually, a couple of TAVR questions, and I'll just leave it at that. Mike, at a high level, does it still make sense from an ROI perspective to develop two TAVR platforms? And then for you, Ian, I heard your comments to Vijay, regarding the commercial impact. But given the result of Scope 1 and 2, there seem to be some clinical risk with the U.S. pivotal trial. And I've looked at the primary safety and efficacy end points. Can you talk about your confidence in the neo2 U.S. pivotal trial being able to show non-inferiority between neo2 and SAPIEN 3 and Evolut PRO, given what we've seen with Scope 1 and 2? It doesn't look like a slam dunk, but I'd love to hear your thoughts. Thanks for taking the questions guys. Michael Mahoney : So perhaps I'll start with the second question there, Larry, about our confidence around the ACURATE neo2 platform. As we said before, the ACURATE neo2 is different to ACURATE neo1 with the larger good and significantly different PBL performance, as we saw from the CE Mark study. And so we believe that data will certainly play out in the \u2013 what we saw in the CE Mark study of ACURATE neo2 will play out in the US ACURATE neo2 IDE study. So we are working with the FDA now. As a consequence of the results of Scope 1 and Scope 2 to plot the path forward. We believe that we will require longer patient follow-up as part of that study, but we remain confident. Larry Biegelsen : Thank you, Mike. Michael Mahoney : In the first quarter on our product portfolio, we're always looking at across our portfolio where our investment spend makes the most sense, given the market opportunities. And we've obviously had the two valve strategy and we're seeing strong results in the sites that are using Lotus in the US, opening new sites has been a challenging exercise for us given the pandemic, but the sites that are using Lotus in the US are using it quite regularly. So we do believe that the two valve strategy makes sense, and we're excited about the ACURATE neo2 launch in Europe. Larry Biegelsen : Thank you, guys. Operator : Next question comes from Joanne Wuensch of Citibank. Please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Hi. Can you hear me, okay? Michael Mahoney : Yes, we hear you fine, Joanne. Joanne Wuensch : Excellent. Good morning. Two sets of questions. First one has to deal with some of your commentary for the fourth quarter. I'm curious, why operating margins would not improve in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter? And I want to make sure I can quantify what the WATCHMAN adjustment is in the fourth quarter because you say you'll have growth ex-WATCHMAN adjustment? Michael Mahoney : Sure. I can probably take that one, Joanne. Second part first. We expect it to be roughly similar. So you saw $63 million top line adjustment for the sales term reserve for the transition. And so as we look at it, obviously, it depends on how we \u2013 how that rolls out in the fourth quarter, but roughly similar, I would say. And then in terms of operating margin, the main driver of that is that Q3 was probably better than we had anticipated. So 23.4%, and that obviously included 170 basis point negative impact from the WATCHMAN sales term reserve. So we're kind of back into a pretty good range on that operating margin in Q3 and would believe that as we head into Q4, being in that range for the fourth quarter is a good place to be. From a gross margin standpoint, it's probably, again, largely similar to what you saw in the third quarter. We were 69.3% gross margin in the quarter. That included a 60 basis point negative impact from the WATCHMAN reserves. So we're in that 69% to 70% range. That's probably where gross margin would settle out in the fourth quarter. And the rest of the P&L should look pretty similar. So the adjusted operating margin for the fourth quarter, I think, is in a good spot, if it's similar to Q3. Joanne Wuensch : Okay. And then big picture, there is a perception, and this is largely after the TCT meeting that there's, how do I say this? Sort of an execution issue that may or may not be happening at Boston Scientific. How much of this is reality? And how much of it is just \u2013 you have so many products that are going through the pipeline, not everything is going to go exactly as planned. Michael Mahoney : Sure. Yes, I think just overall, if you look at the overall execution for a number of years in a row. We've accelerated organic sales growth each year. Last year, we put up about 7.3%, and we \u2013 obviously, with the impact of COVID in 2020, and we've seen strong improvements each quarter. And we're set up for a very strong 2021 based on that product launch schedule. There's no doubt that we were disappointed with the delay with ACURATE neo in the U.S. I think Dr. Meredith has laid out some of those reasons. And now we're excited about the neo2 launch, but we are disappointed in the Scope 1, Scope 2, which delayed the impact of ACURATE neo. But I think the benefit of Boston Scientific is we're highly diversified. You look at the growth of WATCHMAN. You look at the significant growth improvement across our businesses and really the diversification of our business. We've, for many years in a row, continue to reduce down the weighting of DES and CRM in our portfolio, given the growth trajectory of those markets and increase the weighting of our other businesses. And you look at the growth of our PI business with BTG, Endoscopy, URO and neuromod, and also promising growth that we see in EP. So we clearly wish the accurate scope results would have been different. But if you look at the overall execution of the company and the diversification that we've enabled as well as the strong free cash flow and ability to continue to improve margins, we're excited about \u201821 and beyond. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Robbie Marcus : Thanks for taking my question. Maybe Dan or Mike, I was wondering if you could speak to the current M&A environment. You've had a lot of investments on the private side, the balance sheet looks better than it's been in the past. How should we think about M&A? And if you could also touch on the reason for the discontinuation of Apama? Daniel Brennan : Sure. Again, I can start and Mike can comment as well. The M&A environment is a little bit challenging. I think you're probably referring to the IPO market. So within our VC portfolio, we've seen some of the companies go public and with some pretty lofty valuations. We weren't able to acquire those companies. Obviously, the upside on the other side of it is it's a nice financial gain, but that's not why we invest in these. We invested them obviously for the potential to acquire them. So it does seem to present a short-term challenge. We have over 40 companies in our VC portfolio. So there's a lot to choose from, and we'll see where that goes. And we have \u2013 as you know, we have the cash ready and available to be opportunistic relative to M&A in general. So still optimistic that we're going to get some good solid M&A done over time and be able to add to the top line story that we have. Michael Mahoney : Yeah. I think, the pipeline is certainly there of M&A opportunities, but we want to be disciplined in terms of the price that we'll pay and to drive shareholder value. So we'll continue to do that, and we certainly plan to do a few tuck-in acquisitions over the next 12 months. On Apama, essentially, we made the decision there on our portfolio, given the timeline delays that impacted the Apama program with COVID, really along with faster than anticipated new technology developments, namely IRE. We made the decision to discontinue the development and clinical investment in the Apama platform. So we're going to continue to invest significantly in our stable point, our force-sensing catheter. We're very bullish on our Apama \u2013 sorry, on our cryoballoon in Europe. That will be in full launch mode in the fourth quarter, which should provide some significant growth in 2021. And we're very encouraged about the investment that we have in Veripos  for IRE and that's an investment we made six years ago. And now we have an option to purchase that company. So as the market continues to shift, we believe we're in very strong position with those platforms for the future. Robbie Marcus : Thanks. And maybe a quick follow-up. As I listen to your commentary, it sounds like volume trends continue to improve. Are you able to speak to how the pipeline is filling up behind that? How patient visits and scans are filling up behind them? Is there a discrepancy by geography? Thanks. Michael Mahoney : Yeah. I had a few comments there in my script. It's a difficult one to call. I would say, overall, globally, it differs by region, by state. Some states in the U.S. have very normalized referral patterns and new patient funnels, some in the U.S., maybe down 10%. China is essentially back to normal, I would say. And Japan is quite strong. So it really varies around the world. I think if you were to net it all out, it's down. So we're not quite at normal new patient referral programs globally, and we're down. It's tough to call that, whether it's down 5% or down 10%, but it's down slightly. And it really varies by state and by country. Robbie Marcus : Appreciate it. Thanks. Michael Mahoney : Yeah. Operator : Next question comes from Rick Wise of Stifel. Please go ahead. Rick Wise : Good morning, everybody. Maybe just a couple of product questions and just updates. Mike, you highlighted the early success of EXALT-D, 100 accounts opened. Is that where you wanted to be? Is that what you expected? Again, COVID aside and post-COVID, is that what you expected? Just maybe talk us through what's next. And I'll go ahead and ask the other two. Just curious, SENTINEL obviously had a terrific quarter. What's next there and talk about the trial enrollment? And maybe we haven't talked to the S-ICD program in a long time. Just wondering, it seems a little random, but just hearing some competitive noise. What's next from Boston Scientific on that side of the ledger? Thanks a lot. Michael Mahoney : Sure. So EXALT, SENTINEL and S-ICD. Rick Wise : Yeah. Michael Mahoney : I get Dr. Meredith the pitch-in in the middle here. So I don't bore you too much here. But on EXALT, we clearly lost, call it, four to six months, with EXALT-D with that launch. But the really encouraging news in third quarter, we\u2019ve really picked up quite a bit of momentum. So our accounts, we've had more access to our customers in the U.S. and in Europe. And we've opened approximate 100 global accounts. And so, the team has really made strong progress, call it, the last 60 to 90 days in new account openings, training and really starting to increase utilization of that platform. And we also had a nice tailwind. Just I would say broadly, we had strong tailwinds and reimbursement in the third quarter. I won't get through off track. But with the new TPT with EXALT, it was a nice tailwind for that. So we looked at, for EXALT, to be a nice growth driver for us in 2021, we also have the surgical scope recently approved, and we're on track for a bronchoscope. So that's a multibillion-dollar opportunity. Just broadly with reimbursement, I'll just call this out because we picked on a few of the headwinds with Scope 1 and Scope 2. We had some great reimbursement news, not only with Eluvia, but with EXALT, also with in the quarter. So I think it really demonstrates the clinical efficacy of these platforms and the evidence to support the additional reimbursement. So I'll turn it over to Sentinel to Dr. Meredith and maybe S-ICD comments from Dr. Stein. Ian Meredith : Thanks for the question, Rick. With respect to Sentinel, as you know, we were more than 750 accounts worldwide and 20% of in the sites that are actually using Sentinel, actually having a procedure. Shocking as you know is a debilitating and devastating condition that's underreported in TAVR. We believe that this is the right strategy, the protected TAVR trial that you mentioned is now more than ever a critical study to actually prove beyond a shadow of the doubt that protection is the right strategy for TAVR. We're very pleased with having designed that study prospectively. As you know, it's a 3,000 patient study looking at clinical stroke. We have 30 sites enrolled in that trial and continue to activate sites despite COVID. Obviously, there was some slowing of new site activation in the second and early in the third quarter, but we believe that, that will continue to ramp up. So we're looking forward to the results of that trial. It's a critical study in light of the data evidence. And almost everybody pointed to the protected TAVR trial as the single most important study in this field, and I'm glad that we actually planned this prospectively. Michael Mahoney : Dr. Stein, any comments on S-ICD? Kenneth Stein : Yes. Thanks a lot, Mike. And Rick, I'll be quick here. I think we're very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of continued growth with the S-ICD. As I think you know, we recently reported out the results of 2 major clinical trials, pretoria untouched. Pretoria published in the medicine on touched was just published in circulation, which really convincingly show that the S-ICD is a remarkably safe straightforward procedure and ought to be considered as first-line therapy for the broad group of patients with a primary prevention indication who don't have indication for antibradycardia pacing or antitachycardia pacing. I think what comes next and what's, I think, very exciting from that standpoint is we push out our modular cardiac rhythm management concept with the development of our empower pacemaker, which is designed to be able to communicate with S-ICD and can deliver both backup brady pacing and antitachycardia pacing. And that is still on track to launch into clinical trials in the first half of next year. Rick Wise : Thanks, everybody. Operator : Next question comes from Matt Miksic of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Mahoney : Good morning, Matt. Matt Miksic : Hi. Can you hear me okay? Michael Mahoney : Yeah. We hear you fine. Matt Miksic : Terrific. Thank you. So just a couple of questions, if I could, on ASCs and your exposure to the outpatient channel. You've talked that, if I remember correctly, kind of in the two-thirds range. If you could maybe comment on just how those are \u2013 how some of those businesses are performing related to the predominantly inpatient lines of business, maybe in terms of pre-COVID \u2013 percent of pre-COVID levels or any other metrics like that? And then I just had one quick follow-up on the same topic. Michael Mahoney : Sure. Yes, we provided, I think as our \u2013 maybe our first quarter earnings call, the mix by business roughly of our inpatient versus outpatient. And that's really been very consistent in terms of the recovery during COVID. So, across our businesses, not surprising where we had a stronger outpatient orientation. You've seen a bit stronger recovery there with PI and urology, endo and neuromod. You saw neuromod, it was down like, what, 70%, 80% or some crazy number in the second quarter and came back dramatically in third quarter because of patient demand in that setting. So really, uro, endo, PI, neuromod are more oriented to outpatient setting and CRM and interventional cardiology lean a little bit more towards inpatient. And the kind of pace recovery, if you look at the third quarter results are pretty consistent with that. Matt Miksic : That's super helpful. And then just if I could, I think we're all looking at the current trends and wondering over the next couple of months if we're going to be facing some version of what we saw in like July and August in some areas of the country. And in terms of hospitals getting, capacity getting tighter, some regions and states picking counties or ZIP codes and trying to steer folks away from booking inpatient cases or open cases or things like that. I'm wondering if you have any comments or experience from how that went in those areas in the \u2013 in Q3 because we did see a little bit of that and potentially what that might entail over the next several months, if we continue to see that happen as anecdotal as that might be? Michael Mahoney : Yeah. It's tough to call. I mean, we don't see a scenario where the results of 2Q are matched again. So we don't see that happening. And you saw, obviously, a strong improvement, 3% negative growth, neutralizing for the one-time versus third quarter. And as I mentioned before, we've seen sequential improvement really each quarter since the darkest time of COVID. And so the hospitals are doing a remarkably good job of managing COVID patients and electoral procedures. Hospitals have built additional capacity to manage COVID patients during the surge. They're better staffed for it. So I think it's going to be potentially a challenging winter, but the hospitals are much better prepared to manage it, I believe, than they were six to eight months ago. And they're also better able to manage electoral procedures in parallel. So with that, we commented before that the new patient referral pattern globally still isn't at 100% and so that likely still could be under some pressure as COVID continues to surge. But we'll continue to \u2013 we're having great progress in launching new products, getting products approved. We're managing our margins. We'll drive strong EPS, and we'll see how the COVID impact plays out. But we've seen sequential improvement monthly, and we continue to aim for growth in the fourth quarter despite the COVID challenges and excluding the WATCHMAN consignment. Matt Miksic : Thanks Mike. Appreciate that. Michael Mahoney : You bet. Susan Lisa : Last question, Andrew. Operator : Thank you. And that will come from Danielle Antalffy of SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, good morning everyone. Thank you so much for squeezing me in and congrats on a strong quarter. Mike, I have two product related questions. So, first on WATCHMAN, one of the things investors are paying attention to is a potential competitor coming to market. And I was hoping maybe you could outline what the mode from a competitive perspective are that you've built around the WATCHMAN business that should make us feel okay about the continued growth trajectory there? And I'll just ask my second now. On EXALT-D, given the financial constraints at hospitals, I'm just curious about how quickly that can be the meaningful revenue contributor that it probably ultimately will be, but hospitals have to work through their current financial duress. And those are my questions. Thanks so much. Michael Mahoney : Sure. Dr. Stein, do you want to speak to the WATCHMAN clinical capabilities? Kenneth Stein : Yes. Thanks Mike. And Danielle, I think on WATCHMAN, first of all, we're very pleased with the response that we've seen and the clinical data we generated with the FLX device approved on the basis of a trial that didn't just meet its endpoints, but actually showed 100% successful seal at one year. And I think combined with the great clinical results and physician familiarity and ease of use with the FLX device, I think, it is very strong against any competition. We continue to push what is the most robust portfolio of clinical science on the safety and efficacy of the device, the ongoing option trial, which in spite of COVID has continued to enroll well, which extends the use of the device as a first line for patients following a fibrillation. And then as I think you know, we've recently announced the imminent launch of our CHAMPION trial, which is a head-to-head trial of the WATCHMAN device as first line therapy against novel or coagulants. Michael Mahoney : Yes. So, obviously, the clinical safety efficacy is the primary driver and that's why Dr. Stein commented first. And then on the business model that was obviously one of the reasons we switched to the consignment model was to continue to build a strong moat supported by our clinical and efficacy and also the easy to use and just the penetration that we see globally. And the consignment model changeover allows us to drive longer term high committed share contracts at the appropriate price uplift. So, we think that's a smart move for us. On EXALT-D, I mentioned before, with the breakthrough status, we did get the additional reimbursement in the outpatient setting, which is very, very helpful. And we believe with the -- in the inpatient setting and the outpatient setting, there's room in that DRG that makes sense for the EXALT-D platform. So, our Endoscopy team will continue to drive health care economic studies with EXALT-D. It's clear that physicians see the benefit of reducing the infection. And our team is gaining more and more capabilities in terms of how to drive utilization of EXALT-D as each month passes. So, we think this will be a nice growth driver, and we know it will be a nice growth driver for us in 2021. Danielle Antalffy : Thank you. Michael Mahoney : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Susan Lisa for any closing remarks. Susan Lisa : Thank you, Andrew, and thanks, everyone, for joining. We appreciate your time, and we'll now turn it back to Andrew for the replay details. Operator : Thank you.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Apollo Endosurgery Fourth Quarter 2020 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Matt Kreps. Sir, the floor is yours. Matt Kreps : Thank you, John, and thanks, everyone, for participating in today's call to discuss Apollo's fourth quarter 2020 financial and operating results. Joining me on the call are Todd Newton, Chief Executive Officer; and Stefanie Cavanaugh, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including Apollo's financial outlook and Apollo's plans and timing for product development and sales. In addition, there is uncertainty around the spread of the COVID-19 virus and the ultimate impact it may have on our operations, the demand for our products, global supply chains and economic activity in general. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties and could cause actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2020, filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the day of this live broadcast, February 25, 2021. Except as required by law, Apollo undertakes no obligation to revise or update any statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. During this call, we will interchangeably use the term ESS for OverStitch and term IGB for Orbera and vice versa. And now with that completed, I'd like to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Newton : Thank you, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call to discuss our fourth quarter 2020 results. Our expectation coming into the fourth quarter was for COVID disruption to persist, but to be less severe than certainly we experienced in the first half of 2020, and that overall procedure volumes using our products would return to levels similar to the fourth quarter of last year. This expectation was more or less what occurred in our business during the fourth quarter, with the U.S. market being up 15% versus Q4 of 2019, which made up for the more noticeable COVID procedure weakness, which lingered in our international markets, particularly in our European direct markets during November and December. Taken together, our worldwide endoscopy product sales increased 4% in the fourth quarter year-over-year. I am really pleased with our ability to reduce and maintain control over our cash burn in the fourth quarter. Expense reduction programs that were born from necessity due to the coronavirus, along with gradual gross margin progress, resulted in a 53% reduction in our net operating loss in Q4 compared to the same period in 2019 and a 58% improvement in our cash used in operations. The improvement in these 2 important financial metrics should be not just sustainable but can improve from here as our markets stabilize, health care utilization gets back on track and product revenues grow. I'm also pleased to tell you we have completed the X-Tack limited launch. I will give you more detail shortly, but I will tell you now, it went great. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Stefanie to cover the fourth quarter financial results in greater detail. Stef? Stefanie Cavanaugh : Thank you, Todd, and good afternoon, everyone. As Todd mentioned, the fourth quarter of 2020 overall was a stabilizing period for our revenues, even amid regional COVID disruption fluctuations. On the top line, total revenues increased to $12.9 million, a gain of 7% in the fourth quarter of 2020 from the fourth quarter of 2019. Total endoscopy revenue increased 4% to $12.2 million, with U.S. endoscopy sales increasing 15%, while OUS endoscopy sales decreased 6%. Similar to the third quarter, these results reflect continuing U.S. rebound from COVID-19 and differing trend lines in our 2 OUS sales channels. In our OUS direct markets, endoscopy product sales declined 10% due to ongoing COVID case volatility in the fourth quarter. Product sales to distributors began to rebound somewhat and were back to the fourth quarter of 2019 levels. By product, fourth quarter ESS sales increased 2% from 2019, with U.S. ESS sales increasing 10%, to offset the weaker OUS ESS sales, which were impacted by the lingering COVID-19 disruption that I just noted. Fourth quarter IGB product revenue increased 7% from 2019 and U.S. Orbera sales increased 33%, and OUS IGB revenue remained largely stable and consistent compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 56% compared with 49% for the fourth quarter of 2019, increasing from the benefits of our gross margin improvement projects as well as the increase in direct market IGB sales this quarter. Increased inventory production also improved the fourth quarter gross margin results through higher overhead absorption. During the fourth quarter, we restarted select gross margin improvement projects that were put on hold during the pandemic. The next 2 of these projects will address our Sx material costs, and we expect both projects to be completed in the first half of this year. The Sx products represented over 1/3 of our ESS sales outside the U.S. as of the end of 2020 and is the product of choice for most of our newer distributor markets. At current Sx volumes, these 2 projects will reduce material costs by approximately $200,000 per year. Total operating expenses were $10.4 million, down more than $2.3 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The 18% reduction in operating costs is due to the permanent cost savings initially implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As we referenced last quarter, we eliminated approximately $10 million of annual costs compared to pre-COVID spending levels as a result of restructuring efforts and realignment of our business priorities. Pulling all of this together, our operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2020 decreased to $3.2 million from $6.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Cash at the end of the fourth quarter was $37.2 million compared with $38.2 million at the end of the third quarter. We received our second $2 million installment payment from the sale of the surgical product line in December as required. Excluding this payment, our cash used in the fourth quarter was approximately $3 million. As we announced in December, we further enhanced our 2021 liquidity by $12 million through extension of the interest-only period and maturity date of our term loan by 12 months to March 2022 and September 2024, respectively. In addition, the amendment will automatically extend the interest-only period and maturity date by an additional 6 months if we meet specific revenue milestones during 2021. Our cash position, along with this amendment, provides a solid foundation as we focus on reaching positive operating cash flow over the next 4 or 5 quarters. With that, I'll turn it back to Todd. Todd Newton : Thanks, Stef. I want to update you on 2 important topics this afternoon : the X-Tack U.S. limited launch and the reimbursement effort underway to bring coding and coverage to our products. We completed the limited launch earlier this week, and the results were tremendous. During the limited launch, we completed 24 cases, consisting of 13 lower GI cases and 11 cases in the upper GI tract. These cases were performed by 10 doctors across 9 different accounts. The limited launch suggested a physician learning curve after only 1 device. Several of the limited launch cases have been done without our presence after that first use. It is proving to be a see one, do one, teach one kind of product. Our very first X-Tack case was to close a large dissection at the hepatic flexure of the colon of close to 6 centimeters in size and irregularly shaped. The dissection itself to remove the large flat polyp of this size was a significant and time-consuming procedure. Closing a dissection site of this size would likely have been an OverStitch case, except that the hepatic flexure, it would have been a big access challenge with OverStitch on a gastroscope. The physician used 4 X-Tack devices to close this particular defect site. Perhaps, we would have liked a little bit more of a conservative case right out of the gate as our procedure number one, but the challenging cases represent the big unmet need and the reason why we designed X-Tack to begin with. And the device worked great in this highly challenging clinical environment. Each case in the limited launch is its own story and represents a life-changing procedure for the patient. For those 24 limited launch cases completed, the closure sites range from a relatively standard 18-millimeter size all the way to 80 millimeters, which is getting to be a really large site.  During the limited launch, X-Tack has been used to close a large ESD site, all the way across the colon at the ileocecal valve close to the end of the ascending colon where the small intestine turns into the large intestine, a location where OverStitch could not reach. And the X-Tack was also used to successfully close large and irregularly shaped sites where through the scope clips, even in multiple numbers, could not span and would have been ineffective. Closure have been completed using 1 X-Tack device in the more straightforward cases, all the way up to 4 X-Tack devices in the larger and complex cases, such as the one at the ileocecal valve. The average number of X-Tack devices per case in the limited launch was 2. After each case, we asked the physician to rate the functionality and ease of use of the device across a number of performance attributes on a scale of 1 being poor and 5 being excellent, and the device has shown consistently high ratings across all performance measures, with an overall average rating of 4.7. With confirmation of X-Tack's stellar clinical performance and the closeout of our limited launch protocol, we have a very high degree of confidence as we direct our attention to scaling up our manufacturing capacity for the product. The most important capacity enhancing step in front of our manufacturing team is to convert from prototype molds to production molds, and this conversion is on track. Also, the closeout of our limited launch with such high marks gives our sales team confidence as they pursue our highest-priority target accounts and get in front of customer new product evaluation committees. In summary, as we end the limited launch, we are exactly where we hope to be. And if anything, our expectations have been exceeded. We have confirmed device function across a broad diversity of cases and array of closure needs throughout the GI track. User ratings have been excellent. Feedback is that X-Tack is easy to learn and easy to use. We are moving into the next launch stage right on schedule with an acceleration of our X-Tack commercial programs. Yesterday, we went live with the X-Tack product website and began a campaign to harvest our medical education training records to introduce this new technology to physicians who have come through our medical education programs in the past. Right now, outstanding quotes in front of customers pending their new product committee approval aggregate to a high 6-figure dollar amount. Everything learned so far suggests that X-Tack has a real opportunity to significantly disrupt the GI closure market. Shifting to reimbursement. There are activities underway for all products. First, for OverStitch, this is where most of our management team's efforts are directed with specific focus on the ESG procedure and bariatric revisions. We are closing in on the time when we expect the MERIT investigators to publish their study results, which we then plan to use as the cornerstone data piece for our ESG reimbursement strategy. All indications remain that we will see the MERIT study data accepted for publication sometime before the middle point of 2021. We do not have access to this independent study's data, but we have high confidence that the study will achieve its primary outcome objectives based on more than 80 studies and articles published in peer-reviewed literature describing and analyzing the ESG procedure since 2015. This worldwide data has been remarkably consistent in reporting favorable efficacy and safety results. As MERIT data nears release, we have turned to other groundwork that is part of the ESG reimbursement plan. In the fourth quarter, we submitted applications to begin the process for both ICD-10 coding and HCPCS coding for all OverStitch applications, including the ESG procedure and for bariatric revisions. The reviews of these code applications are in process, and the earliest date for a decision on either code application is probably October. The CPT coding effort will become better known following the publication of MERIT data, but it would be our goal for ESG coding to be considered by the CPT panel hopefully before the end of the year. The MERIT data will also be of interest to the payer communities in the U.S. and several other key countries, and we intend to engage these communities in coverage and payment discussions with the primary endpoint results once they're published. The prize for expanding the market access for the ESG procedure is very meaningful. There were an estimated 350,000 bariatric procedures performed in our direct markets during 2019, while only 7,500 ESGs were performed, largely without coverage. Each 1% increase in ESG's market share that comes with coverage is an incremental $5.6 million of revenue at today's average selling prices. And of course, a 10% market share is therefore equivalent to $56 million of revenue. In addition to reimbursement, we have plans to expand the OverStitch labeling to include both the ESG procedure and bariatric revisions. The MERIT data, again, is very critical, along with other prospectively collected ESG and revision data for this label expansion effort. Label expansion adds value because it will allow us to improve our medical education content that we provide to physicians today and also improve patient awareness. Second, there appears to be some progress with respect to U.S. codings that could be beneficial to both Orbera and X-Tack. First, for Orbera. In the fourth quarter, ICD-10 codes for the endoscopic insertion and removal of devices were approved by CMS, which are applicable to Orbera. These became effective in October. And in the fourth quarter, we saw that an application for a CPT code for intragastric balloons was on the agenda for the CPT editorial panel meeting, which occurred earlier this month. Separately, we submitted for a HCPCS code for Orbera during the fourth quarter. And we continue to be in various society and regulator discussions for the consideration of Orbera as a treatment for pre-cirrhotic NASH patients with fibrosis ever since the publication of the Mayo Clinic study on this in early 2020. This data, along with previously published data outside the United States, in our opinion, shows that Orbera has a reasonable likelihood of both technical success and clinical success in providing a more effective NASH treatment than today's standard of care. If these discussions are successful, all these codings developments could be very meaningful for our U.S. Orbera product line. But the consideration of an IGB code wasn't the only CPT panel agenda item of interest to us. Also on this same agenda was consideration for a CPT code for endoscopic submucosal dissection or what is referred to as ESD. ESD is an endoluminal procedure for the en bloc resection of larger flat gastrointestinal tumors, especially colorectal tumors. The approval of this CPT code, along with the coverage and payments down the road, would expand the already attractive addressable market for X-Tack. The AMA's website indicates that the CPT panel results will be released by March 8. Lastly, our team also filed ICD-10 and HCPCS applications for X-Tack back in December upon its 510(k) clearance. For the past few years, we have made medical education the cornerstone of our OverStitch strategy. There were 2 important elements to this. First, because endoluminal suturing was so novel, it was very important to capture physician mind share through peer-reviewed publications that describe the clinical value that endoluminal suturing can deliver. And second, we needed world-class training capability to teach physicians the mechanics of using OverStitch, which can be technically challenging to get through a learning curve and get started with. Since we implemented this strategy in 2015, OverStitch revenue CAGR has been 38% up until the 2020 coronavirus disruption. In 2020, the literature side of the strategy, though, continued to deliver results, as 73 publications and medical journals mentioned OverStitch and 35 publications mentioned our intragastric balloons. 18 of these intragastric balloon publications referenced the potential as part of the treatment for NASH. The other element of our medical education strategy, which is positioned product training, did get disrupted by COVID. Physician society meetings went virtual, and travel and group gatherings were restricted. But nonetheless, at the beginning of the fourth quarter, we restarted the mobile lab in the United States and conducted hands-on training for 75 physicians in 14 different U.S. cities. We expect this effort will refill both our new account and expanding user pipelines for OverStitch in 2021 as well as support the launch of X-Tack. Before I open the call to questions, I want to say that we will not be providing 2021 guidance today. I think it's best for Apollo's next CEO to speak to that without me setting expectations for him, and I hope you will all understand that. I will say, however, that we are off to a good start in the first quarter and tracking to produce at least 10% sales growth over the first quarter of 2020, even before considering any X-Tack contribution. We have still been experiencing through the first 2 months of the first quarter some intermittent pockets of COVID weakness, which suggests that March results could surprise in either direction, but we are doing well so far in the first quarter. And demand from our international markets, particularly from distributor markets, is improving. And of course, the U.S. is continuing to progress very well. As I've said before, as long as elective procedures are allowed and health care delivery is normal, our business will do well. So after questions and answers, I'm going to have a couple of closing comments. But on that note, we'll now open the lines for questions. John, please proceed with questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have a question coming from Matt Hewitt from Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Matt Hewitt : And I guess before I get to those, I just want to say, Todd, it's been a pleasure working with you. And best of luck in, obviously, all of your endeavors going forward. I look forward to checking your progress, see where you land next, but congratulations on all the progress that you've made here at Apollo. Todd Newton : Thank you, Matt. Matt Hewitt : First question in there, you hit some really key topics. But the first one, on X-Tack, congratulations on the soft launch. How quickly can we start to think about, from a commercial standpoint -- I think you mentioned that you've already got 6-figure orders outstanding, how quickly will that translate into the income statement? And where can that go maybe over the course of the year? Todd Newton : Yes. Matt, unfortunately, I did mention that I don't feel like I should give 2021 guidance, and that would include ramp rates and the like. I just feel like that's better for the next CEO to come. But I can tell you that I feel like we have a really good level of activity going on right now. As I indicated, the -- those quotes that are in front of accounts where we're going through the new product committee process, sometimes called the VAC process, that is going well. And the limited launch results certainly give us a great deal of confidence as we pursue those opportunities. Matt Hewitt : Okay. And maybe a different way of asking the question without getting necessary guidance, but how -- help us think about a 6-figure order. How quickly will an account work through something of that size? I mean, is that over a couple of months? Is that a couple of quarters? Just help us size that up. Todd Newton : Yes. So our view, if you base it off the limited launch results, we are going -- we're using about 2 X-Tack devices per case. And those cases generally are at that 2 -- let's say, 2-centimeter size that we have indicated is really the ideal target for X-Tack or higher. . And so I think it will just depend a little bit upon each individual account and how often they are encountering those, but I can feel confident in saying that our view is that the frequency at which doctors are going to have those cases will be at a greater rate than OverStitch use within a relatively short period of time. Relatively short period being over the next, say, few years, couple of years. Matt Hewitt : Okay. That's helpful. And then as far as OverStitch is concerned, I think everyone is excited and waiting on the MERIT data. But walk through -- so the data comes out, is it your hope and expectation that Apollo would have some, albeit maybe minor, but have some reimbursement in place even by the end of the year? Or is that more of a '22-type event before the reimbursement starts to layer on? Todd Newton : Yes. And just to remind you, Matt, I think you certainly you know this from our earlier conversations, we have, in some places, reimbursement today for ESG. And it's just not broad coverage. It's more individual accounts working with specific, let's call it, insurance providers, private payers, where they are getting reimbursed for OverStitch, the ones being used for ESG. And certainly, that's the case today for bariatric revisions. Bariatric revisions are nearly always paid for. It's an exceedingly rare situation today when we don't have a bariatric revision using OverStitch that is being just normally paid for. So what we're really looking at is trying to expand that and using the MERIT data to expand that and to really broaden this to being more of a national coverage and part of national coverage policies. That's probably still though going to involve coding and coverage and timing around all those things such that it's unlikely to affect us in 2021. Hopefully, there could even be some benefits in 2022. But the way that most of these coding processes lay out their calendars, it's probably more of a 2023 event in our future. Matt Hewitt : Okay. Understood. All right. And then shifting to Orbera. Obviously, the CPT code news was positive when we saw that it was on the calendar. We're still waiting for that news. But maybe -- that business has -- is starting to recover even without reimbursement, per se. And as we start to think about areas where reimbursement is possible or likely, I think some of the areas you talked about as having interest are NASH -- as a treatment for NASH, for surgical procedures where maybe high BMI patient, getting them down to a fighting weight beforehand. I know that there's trials ongoing for that and for orthopedic procedures. But how do you -- help us understand, from a size perspective, like how big of a market or -- what kind of an opportunity does that represent for Orbera? Todd Newton : Yes. We -- in our Investor Relations slide deck, which is on our website, and I don't have these numbers right in front of me right now. But on that -- in that deck, we have a number of demographic data points that talk about those top 3, if you will, priority areas that we have been pursuing. It talks about the population, for example, that is in our BMI range of 30 to 40, who also are going to be those NASH patients. And so I'd just refer you there. But the size of these markets are significant. I think you'll see that the number for NASH, for example, where the fibrosis levels are 2 or 3 and their BMI is over 30, but lower than 40, so it makes it consistent with Orbera label. That's roughly a 10 million U.S. population. If you go down to the -- to those that would be eligible for using Orbera, again, BMI 30 to 40 and the number of just total joint replacements done per year, that's another 300,000 procedures that are done for those patients that are within that range of BMI and so on and so on. So these are significant markets that can make a difference for our Orbera business here in the United States. Matt Hewitt : Okay. Maybe one last one for me, and I'll hop back in the queue. Another nice improvement in gross margin in the quarter. You've taken some steps. You mentioned that you're in the process of starting the next phase of gross margin improvement projects. But as we think about fiscal '21 and not so much of guidance, but that should continue, the gross margin should continue to trend higher along with your revenues as sales continue to grow? Is that accurate? Stefanie Cavanaugh : Yes. It is. And our biggest contributor to gross margin improvement this year will be X-Tack. It has a high variable gross margin, and so that will be contributing to our gross margin improvement this year as will the 2 projects I talked about in my prepared remarks. Operator : I'd now like to turn the floor back to Todd Newton for some additional remarks. Todd Newton : Well, thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This will be my last call as CEO of Apollo. Earlier this month, we announced the appointment of Chas McKhann as CEO effective on March 1. And this is a good time for transition as great things are on the horizon. Today, we sit with a high-growth product portfolio, and each of our products are directed at high-value, large addressable markets. As I reflect back about OverStitch, this was a product originally designed for NOTES, or Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery, which is a leading-edge and maybe you'd even say it's a bleeding-edge surgical concept. But no one is doing or looking to do oral appendectomies. 6 years ago, when we would engage physicians about OverStitch, their reactions would be, \"Well, gee, that's a cool technology. When will I ever use it?\" Since that time, we have answered that question. Today, OverStitch is emerging as the standard of care for bariatric provisions and for esophageal stent fixation in addition to various other core GI applications that call for full-thickness tissue approximation. Physicians see the enormous value potential of ESG for the obese as a primary obesity procedure. And in the months ahead, I expect us to hear more from physicians developing an OverStitch endoscopic antireflux procedure, which is today being called RAP, as a possible alternative to surgical fundoplication. We have taken down other OverStitch adoption barriers by building world-class medical education capabilities. We developed the Sx for those at locations or in markets who do not have access to a dual-channel scope. And now we are expanding the incredible versatility of suturing into the large lower GI market with X-Tack. Orbera, too, is under revival with a medical-use strategy that leverages its unique patient value proposition. Thank you to Matt Hewitt for that question of what those things look like today. And along the way, we have made some tough decisions to shed lower-performing products and programs to reach the point we are at today, a company with a clear identity. The future looks good, and we have specific plans for further improving the structural self-sufficiency of the business with very specific, well-conceived and executable gross margin improvement projects. We have dramatically reduced our cash burn, and we have probably the best ever balance sheet as a company. The business is certainly not on cruise control, and I would never say that it is, but we have a solid plan and the human and financial resources to execute it. So it's time to close the repositioning chapter and begin to write a great commercial execution chapter. I'll be supporting my transition and have every confidence in Chas, along with our executive team, to lead Apollo Endosurgery forward. Chas has an impressive track record, with a resume that includes successful commercial roles at Boston Scientific, Johnson & Johnson, Torax Medical and Intersect ENT. And lastly, to all the men and women of Apollo Endosurgery past and present over the past 6.5 years, thank you. We've come a long way, baby. Apollo Endosurgery has truly changed interventional gastrointestinal endoscopy as well as the treatment options for the many affected by the various metabolic diseases caused by obesity. And the company is poised to burn its mark even deeper. So should you have any questions or would like to arrange a call with us, please contact Matt Kreps at Darrow Associates. The company also plans to participate in several virtual investor conferences coming up ahead in the month of March. Please also contact Matt if you'd like to request a meeting as part of one of those events. Thank you, and have a good evening. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants are placed on listen-only mode. And the floor will be opened for your questions and comments following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Matt Kreps of Darrow Associates. Sir, the floor is yours. Matt Kreps : Thank you, Catherine and thanks everyone for participating in today's call to discuss Apollo's first quarter 2021 financial and operating results. Joining me on the call are Charles McKhann, our Chief Executive Officer; and Stefanie Cavanaugh, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including Apollo's financial outlook and Apollo's plans and timing for product development and sales. In addition, there is uncertainty around the spread of the COVID-19 virus and the ultimate impact it may have on our operations, the demand for our products, global supply chains, and economic activity in general.  These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties and could cause actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2020, filed previously with the Securities and Exchange Commission and our most recent form 10-Q. The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the day of this live broadcast, May 4th, 2021. Except as required by law, Apollo undertakes no obligation to revise or update any statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Charles. Charles McKhann : Thanks Matt. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. I'm pleased to speak with you today on my first quarterly conference call as Apollo CEO. We're off to a great start to the year. On the call, we will discuss Apollo's third straight quarter posting robust sales growth. But first, I'd like to take the time to share our strategy to transform the company into a market leader in the field of therapeutic endoscopy.  In recent weeks, many of you are asked me why I decided to join Apollo. I follow the company for many years. I know the founding CEO and some of the company's original venture capital investors. For years I've been impressed with Apollo's long held vision to build an entirely new field of therapeutic endoscopy as well as the company's remarkable technical innovation, most notably the OverStitch devices. I'm also familiar with the ups and downs that the company has faced since its formation 15 years ago. And so with that understanding of the history that I'm thrilled to be joining Apollo at such a pivotal time as we transform into a market leading growth company. I believe that we have a distinctive, differentiated product portfolio that advances minimally invasive endoscopic surgery, and helps GI and bariatric professionals, enhance the standard-of-care, potentially for millions of patients around the world.  At times, the words pivotal and transformational can be so overused in the business community that they lose their meaning. When I was approached about the CEO role, I did my homework on the company's products, procedures, and prospects with three different product lines, all of which have very attractive growth opportunities. I believe that we can fundamentally change the trajectory of this business to delivering consistent, sustainable growth over the years ahead. And that is what I mean, when I use the word pivotal, though now we're at a pivotal point. To me, transformational reflects the impact that we can have on patient care, with continued advances in technology development, such as our recent clearance of X-Tack and more comprehensive market development efforts for ESG, and the use Orbera for patients with NASH, we have the opportunity to address very large market opportunities. More than 100 million people in the United States, 100 million adults in the United States are obese. More than 20 million colonoscopies are performed each year. More than 10 million patients suffer from NASH and have a BMI between 30 and 40. And these are only the US figures. We are a global company. By targeting these populations, we have the potential to increase the scale of patients who may benefit from our technologies from thousands per year to potentially hundreds of thousands per year or more. That is transformational. To achieve our goals, I envision three phases for Apollo to execute our strategy and deliver transformational growth. I call these three phases, energize, accelerate and lead from the front. We've included a new slide in our investor deck, describing these three phases. As you will see from our Q1 results that we announced today, the energize phase is well underway. The energize phase is all about building momentum, by driving near term growth over the next several quarters and achieving strategic milestones that, I believe, will lay the foundation for years of sustainable growth. Near term growth opportunities include continued development of our overseas franchise, scaling our X-Tack launch in the US, steady execution of our IGB franchise, and recovery in some of our OUS markets that continue to see impacts from COVID-19. Yesterday, we announced the appointment of two new commercial leaders, who will join Apollo next week. Kirk Ellis and Steve Bosrock rock are both experienced customer focused leaders, who will increase our capabilities and enhance our execution during this energize phase. In addition, we plan to make targeted additions to our sales team to support our growth aspirations. We anticipate several company milestones during the energize phase, starting with the release of the MERIT study results. MERIT is a randomized control trial of the ESG procedure and a cornerstone of our plans to pursue a new indication for ESG and develop it into a potentially market-leading weight-loss procedure. More on that in a minute. Another key milestone will be defining the clinical pathway required to take advantage of or Orbera\u2019s breakthrough designation to treat patients with NASH. The current standard of care, offers NASH patients very limited prospects for recovery. And that's a key reason why we received the breakthrough designation. A well designed clinical study, focused on achieving a new indication for Orbera for patients with NASH, offers great promise to these patients and our balloon franchise. Phase two is accelerate and it builds on the growth engines that, through continued expansion of X-TACK tech and increased OverStitch utilization, and then layers in the potential for more widespread adoption of the ESG procedure. In particular, following the release of the MERIT study results, and assuming that these results are in line with prior clinical studies of ESG, we will leverage them to pursue new indications -- the new ESG indication, as well as reimbursement in the US and in key markets around the world. And then, finally in phase three, lead from the front, I see Apollo as a market leader by : one, positioning X-Tack as the standard of care for a range of large closer needs across the GI tract; two, continue to develop ESG into a market leading weight-loss procedure; three, expanding the approval of Orbera to include the treatment of NASH; and four, continuing to innovate through a strong R&D pipeline that advances the field of therapeutic endoscopy. And I believe that delivering on these three phases will position Apollo for exciting sustainable growth over many years. The near-term opportunities will contribute in 2021 and 2022. The key priorities in Phase 2 and 3 that I've described will take some time to unfold. And we are putting the plans in place now to ensure we maximize the sizable market opportunities. And so allow me to elaborate more on the first phase of our transformation, the energized phase. And I want to share some of the things that I've learned in my first 60 days that have me so excited about the path ahead, starting with OverStitch and the growth in Endoscopic Suturing. In my travels, talking to customers, I've consistently heard that OverStitch is a one of a kind product that gets excellent reviews from our customers. A number of physicians have told me that OverStitch is the tool that they use to differentiate their clinical practice. And OverStitch sales have been growing at 25% to 30% per year, primarily based on two factors. Existing users continue to increase their use of the product, and new users who have gone through our medical education programs, and subsequently incorporate OverStitch into their clinical practice. OverStitch has a wide range of potential applications in therapeutic endoscopy, including stent fixation and repairs of dissections, resections and perforations. But the ESG procedure stands out as an application that can have the -- that can help and impact the greatest number of patients. ESG has the potential to offer a unique value proposition of efficacy, safety and convenience for patients. Clinical results to date have demonstrated clinically meaningful weight loss, via incisionless, reversible anatomy sparing procedure. Furthermore, ESG procedures require shorter hospital stays and have faster recovery times compared to typical bariatric surgeries. Importantly, only 1% of indicated patients currently undergo bariatric surgeries. Physicians tell us that ESGs are often performed on patients who are not good surgical candidates, or who already decided they don't want surgery. And as a result, ESG has the potential to address a major unmet clinical need for patients who are not well-served by existing approaches. The MERIT study is a key milestone in the path forward for ESG. Independent investigators have completed the 12-month follow-up, and they are working on the initial publication and presentation of the outcomes. We anticipate a publication of the study in the second half of 2021. Once MERIT is published and assuming these results are in line with previous studies of ESG, we intend to pursue a label expansion to cover real primary ESG procedures and bariatric revision procedures. If successful, a new indication would enable Apollo to promote the ESG procedure, provide physician education and training programs to a broader group of practitioners, and initiate programs to increase patient awareness of the benefits of ESG. The MERIT study will also be central in our efforts to secure reimbursement coding, coverage and payment, both in the U.S. and in markets around the world. The investment will likely be a multi-year process that will unfold the following the publication of MERIT results, which was essential for some pair benefit in 2022, and then continued progress in subsequent years. Building on the success of OverStitch, our ESS franchise now has a second growth driver an X-Tack, adding an adjacent new market opportunity that is a strong complement to our existing OverStitch business. X-Tack is unique with a wide range of applications in both the upper and the lower GI. Physicians are already applying it in a wide range of GI tract closures, ranging from relatively simple closures, such as polyp removal to highly complex irregular geometries or standard TTS clips, simply don't get the job done. Results from early cases using X-Tack, have been compelling and that is driving a lot of enthusiasm for the product. Our initial X-Tack customers are primarily current users of OverStitch. Given X-Tack shorter learning curve, ease of use and wide variety of both upper GI app \u2013 and lower GI applications, we anticipate that the user base for X-Tack will expand. At the end of Q1, we have introduced X-Tack, in almost 50 accounts, a nice increase from the nine accounts who participated in our initial limited launch. These accounts are providing important insights into how best to scale our launch and increase utilization. In March, we sponsor our first X-Tack educational webcast, hosted by Dr. Andrew Storm from the Mayo Clinic. More than 150 physicians joined the webcast and participated for a full two hours in discussions about the applications for X-Tack. The level of engagement from the participants was a great indication that this product is capturing the interest of our target audience. A recording of the webinar is now available on X-Tack.com.  We continue to advance our launch in the second quarter. We will continue to advance the launch in the second quarter, and the rest of 2021 with a keen eye for creating effective education tools, introducing X-Tack in a new centers, driving adoption in buildings sustainable use patterns. Our sales team has been focused on expanding access to X-Tack and we are managing a new account pipeline and potential orders that are working their way to hospital procurement processes and is worth a total of more than $1 million in potential sales. Turning to IGB, the Orbera Balloon has been a very solid franchise for Apollo, and it's potentially an underappreciated asset. IGB is still a very important customer need for weight loss solutions that are less invasive than current bariatric surgical options, but more effective than diet and exercise alone. The 41% year-on-year worldwide growth that we have seen with the IGB franchise is an excellent testament to the strength of this product line. That said, in a few years, I believe that, we will look back on Q1, 2021 and say that, the strategic positioning of Orbera was fundamentally changed based off events of this quarter. My very first day on the job, we announced FDA breakthrough designation for the treatment of patients with NASH and this is a validation of the strategies developed over the past several years to position IGB therapy as an effective clinical treatment options for medical conditions. We are working on the next steps to maximize the benefits of this designation, including designing a clinical trial that will be required to pursue label expansion. We are in discussions with FDA and CMS about the trial design and we hope to have an approved trial by the end of the year. We also receive notification that the American Medical Association assigned new Category I CPT Codes for IGB procedures. It was interesting to learn that 6 separate physician organizations supported the efforts, demonstrating widespread support in the community. In addition \u2013 we're pleased to see that the American Gastroenterological Association, the AGA has for the first time, issued practice guidelines, recommending the use of IGB for appropriate patients. Taking together, these three developments enhance the value of the IGB franchise. And then turning to Q1 performance, I'm very pleased with here \u2013 with the team here at Apollo, and their work that has resulted in a very positive start to 2021. Even with some lingering effects of COVID and a smaller team in place versus the prior year, we've achieved 29% revenue growth over Q1 2020, driven by 26% growth ESS and 41% growth in IGB. And we believe that our first quarter results provide a solid foundation for the year ahead. It's an exciting time at Apollo. I look forward to leveraging all three of our product lines to energize the business that accelerate growth over time, and ultimately lead the field of therapeutic endoscopy. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Stefanie to cover the first quarter financial results in greater detail. Stef? Stefanie Cavanaugh : Thank you, Todd, and good afternoon, everyone. As Todd mentioned, the first quarter of 2021 overall, demonstrated strong growth against a relatively stable fourth quarter and a prior your first quarter that saw the first impacts of the COVID 19 shutdowns. Total revenue was $13.9 million, a 29% increase from the $10.7 million a year ago, as a result of 26% growth in our ESS franchise and 41% growth of IGB product sales. Geographically, revenue performance was driven by 43% growth in US sales and 18% growth OUS. In US, ESS sales increased 44% and IGB sales increased 64%. X-Tack sales are included in our ESS results, which we don't intend to disclose separately, but sales of our ESS products excluding X-Tack, increased greater than 30% over the prior year, which is evidencing a return of our OverStitch product sales growth to our pre-COVID historical experience. OUS markets also performed well in the quarter as distributor activity increased following the recovery of many of their markets from the effects of the pandemic, which helped to offset the impact of evolving COVID restrictions in certain direct European markets throughout the quarter. Overall, we generated a 5% increase in ESS sales and 33% increase in IGB sales for the quarter on a year-over-year basis. The low ESS growth primarily reflects the impact of those recent COVID waves in certain direct markets in Europe, which we believe will continue to pose some challenges in the near term, until the global recovery expands. Gross margin also continued to improve, increasing 2% over the prior year to 54% due to higher sales, and the benefit of our continuing gross margin improvement projects. The most important gross margin improvement project coming online this year is the X-Tack launch. X-Tack has been designed from the beginning to be accretive to our current consolidated gross margin. Operating expenses also compared favorably year-over-year, down $1.1 million, as a result of the long-term restructuring benefits of our 2020 cost reduction and operating efficiency program. As a result of all of these factors, higher revenue, improved gross margin and lower operating costs, operating loss declined by 44% to just $3.8 million for the quarter. Turning to the balance sheet, our cash balance remains strong at $32.6 million, reflecting the use of approximately $4.3 million dollars for the quarter, of which approximately 1.3 million was due to working capital changes associated with our increased revenue. We also further extended our balance sheet runway by achieving our financial targets necessary to qualify for an additional six month extension of the interest only period and are renegotiated and more favorable debt terms announced in December last year, meaning, we will have no principal payments due as of September 2022. Turning to the topic of 2021 outlook, we are pleased to have a solid start to the year in our first quarter results. Today, we are establishing a full year revenue target of $55 million to $57 million in 2021 or 30% to 35% growth over 2020. In arriving at this range, we have taken a cautious approach for several reasons. First, we continue to experience ongoing uncertainty around the impact of COVID-19, especially in our OUS markets. And this includes uncertainty around how the various lockdowns may influence traditional Q3 European holiday schedules this year. We are also still in the early days of our X-Tack product launch. And while the launch is going well and we are excited about continued growth in this line, we are still early in the process of learning how quickly we will grow new accounts and extract utilization. And finally, we are actively updating our execution plans for our existing business lines as part of our recent change in the future. We plan to revisit this outlook later in the year as we gain greater clarity and advance our plans on the items I just mentioned. So, this will conclude our prepared remarks and with that Catherine, please open the line for questions. Operator : Certainly. Your first question is coming from Matt Hewitt. Your line is live. Matt Hewitt : Good afternoon. Congratulations on the strong quarter and welcome, Chas. Charles McKhann : Matt, you just cut out on us. Matt Hewitt : Can you hear me? Charles McKhann : Back now. You are back. Matt Hewitt : Okay, great. Well, congratulations on the strong start to the year and welcome Chas. Maybe the first question regarding X-Tack, obviously that was a pretty significant jump in just a couple months from nine sites to -- roughly 50. What kind of ramp should we be anticipating in the number of sites and doctors over the course of the year, or was this kind of, you want to get to this stage, kind of see how it plays out and then maybe add further later in the year? Charles McKhann : Yes. No great, great question Matt. And honestly we're still learning as we go, but as you know, the hospital group procurement processes are called value analysis committees typically. And there's a variable process right now. What I can say is that the value proposition for X-Tack is very favorable, and so when we go through those reviews, they've been very well-received. But some hospitals are quite slow right now in coming out of a COVID environment of how quickly they just even will put things through the process. I mentioned that we've got a very robust pipeline, valued at more than a $1 million. This potential -- is referencing. And -- but they'll take a number of months to unfold, we would anticipate, but the sales team has done a nice job of casting a wide net, but still focused primarily within an original group that was referred to in the prior calls of our existing overseas user. So, in a targeted way, but making sure we get the quotes out and into the processes and all those accounts. Matt Hewitt : Understood. And, I guess, maybe digging in a little bit deeper within the existing user group. What kind of feedback and kind of reorder patterns are you seeing from some of the initial users? Charles McKhann : Yes. No -- also great question. First, I mentioned it in the prepared remarks, but really to emphasize one of the things that we've seen is the range of uses of X-Tack. I know in the prior communication, there was a lot of focus on the lower GI because that is new for Apollo, right OverStitch primarily use the upper GI. But what we've seen is and there's a new slide in our investor deck that shows even from the limited launch, a whole wide range of uses across upper and lower GI. So we're really encouraged by that. It's still quite early in terms of hospitals that have a number of months of runway, but we are pleased to see that a number of those have already started to reorder monthly, and we have a little bit more history under our belts, we'll be able to provide more granularity about reorder patterns. Matt Hewitt : Okay. Okay. And then, shifting gears to Orbera. Obviously, it was a pretty remarkable quarter, and I think, as I look at the performance, given even some of the continued issues with COVID, it was a pretty strong quarter. As you look out, I would expect, as the vaccines are rolled out and maybe COVID subsides a little more, you should expect some more growth, both domestically and internationally, but as you start to think about next year, particularly with, I think, you mentioned the need for a trial. Help us think about that piece of it a little bit. So you've gotten feedback that you're going to be required to do a trial. How should we think about the size of that trial, the duration, cost? And I guess, the another piece is, can you use existing data? How much -- obviously, you've developed a long history of data, can you use that as part of any trial that the FDA requires? Charles McKhann : All really good questions and frankly, ones that we're still working through with not one, but two agencies, that's part of the benefit of having a breakthrough designation. You negotiate and ultimately agree on a trial with both FDA and CMS. I can tell you we are in active discussions with both agencies. And as we work through those, we\u2019ll get better direction from them about the size of the trial, but we do expect it's going to take a new trial to prospectively evaluate, specifically, in this patient population. But you're asking me great questions about the size of the trial, and number of patients, those sorts of things. And we just don't have that agreement yet with the agency. I did very intentionally, as I described my three phases. Think of the NASH opportunity in a third phase. I think it is going to take a few years to really work through. In the meantime, we are incredibly encouraged by what we're seeing with the balloons. And I think some of it, there's some factors that are more near term in nature, contributing that, the gene 15 associated with COVID is real. There have been articles published in the New York Times and a recent publication in JAMA, about how much weight gain we've seen, typically at a 1.5 pounds per month. So we think that is actually impacting end user demand. We are seeing some differences in site of service and bariatric practices embracing the balloon. And then I mentioned the age lines, which are very positive development and for the first time embracing the balloon. So I think we do have some opportunities in the near term with our existing balloon business, while we work on the strategic repositioning associated with that. Matt Hewitt : Got it. Yes. Actually that\u2019s perfect, you've kind of answered the next question, which was are you seeing a pickup in demand just because of the news earlier this year with breakthrough designation in CPT code, is that alone starting to drive some adoption, so it's good to hear that that is. Maybe one last one and then I'll hop back in the queue, regarding OverStitch, obviously, that has continued to be a strong performer for you, but it still is somewhat of early days. As the country and quite frankly, the world starts to reopen, how should we anticipate that the growth profile for that device, particularly as we think about it from an ESG perspective, but just in general, are you anticipating, maybe that growth accelerates as the country and world reopens? Thank you. Charles McKhann : Yeah. Matt, great questions, Let's take the outside of the U.S. part of that question first, because as Stef mentioned, the one area where we've some downsized from a COVID standpoint, mostly has been with Endoscopic Suturing, especially in our direct markets in Europe. And it's not surprising, right? Those cases typically are more impatient procedures. And if you go back to Q1, the U.K. was basically shutdown then other markets were shutdown. And we're still seeing some lingering effects of that. So, just in the month of April, again, not telling you anything you don't know about markets like France being closed down over the month of April. So, these are -- so we certainly see a recovery there overtime. And it's hard to predict exactly the pace. We need to remind ourselves even a lot of -- as a people in the U.S. are getting vaccinated. I think it's accurate to say that more people are currently suffering from the virus than any point during the pandemic when we look globally. So, we're watching it all very carefully. Having said all that, as we come out of it, I do think that the benefits of the medical education programs that the company has had in place for years will continue to pay dividends, meeting with new users who are embracing the technology. And then, as we start having additional information about ESG and then the MERIT results. And then an education will be a big deal for us, right? Because we do not -- we are very careful about how we promote and not promote this procedure. And having a new indication, which we're anticipating in the first half of next year, will allow us to do a lot of different things from a training standpoint, from education standpoint to physicians, from an education standpoint to patients. And we think that can be big accelerator as we move forward. Matt Hewitt : That's great. Thank you. Stefanie Cavanaugh : Thanks Matt. Operator : Our next question is coming from Adam Maeder. Your line is live. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys, this is actually Duran [ph] for Adam. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the really nice quarter. And Charles congrats on the new role, I'm looking forward to seeing what changes you have in place for Apollo. I was wondering, if you could just speak to a little bit on how you intend to deliver on some of those pieces, especially those lined-up on the Energize portion of the slide. What are the biggest factors or milestones that we need to see to be successful with some of those items in the initial phase? And then, as we start thinking about some of the recent commercial changes that you guys have announced over the last couple of weeks, maybe you could speak to how you see the new commercial team reshaping, how the organization operates today? Charles McKhann : Sure, Thanks, Duran. Yeah, so on the Energize phase. The way we're thinking about it, really is a combination of near-term growth. And then important milestones then lay the foundation for the next wave. And on the near-term growth, the good news, part of it is we're already seeing it, right? And so it's a matter of being able to extend it and continue so with OverStitch, for example, as I mentioned, we are starting to return, OverStitch have been growing a little bit under the radar, 25% or more per year. And putting aside a bit last year for COVID, we're getting back to that. And it's with new users, it's with existing users, finding additional uses for the devices. And it is starting to see the growth of some Endo-Bariatric practices, and there are a number of them as I've made my travels. And as I mentioned, we're not actively promoting that, but there are a number of physicians that have now embraced ESG and are starting to really feature that in their practices. So that'll be I think a big element here in \u2013 in that part of it. The second will X-Tack, X-Tack does not require \u2013 well, let me put in the positive. X-Tack has a relatively short learning curve. It can be used rather than one or two specialists in institution. We think it could be four or five or more physicians in some of our larger institutions. So for that, it's going to be continued account growth, and then a real focus on driving utilization \u2013 depth in it for me \u2013 in the product launches, depth of utilization is so important and we're going to really focus on that. And I'll come back to it in a minute. And then third, for Orbera, as I just mentioned, we've had really, really good results. And so, we are working in \u2013 which ones of those may be transient and related to COVID and which ones can be more sustainable to put Orbera on a \u2013 on a growth pathway. And we think there's possibility there. So more work to do, but we're excited about that. Excuse me, to answer your question about the commercial team. The change really started with my desire to separate out the marketing and sales functions and have \u2013 dedicated expertise at a leadership level with both of them. Excuse me \u2013 I'll give you an example. So for X-Tack, the team has done a nice job and it's focused primarily on our OverStitch customers, which is a great place to start. They're natural users of X-Tack. And we've gotten some good traction. But already, I've been working with some folks that I know on expanding, how we think about the launch. They see purchasing additional procedural data really being a little more sophisticated about exactly where the procedures are, and then we'll be targeting our launch based of that information, and it'll help us really get a deeper understanding of what our launch priorities will be overtime, and how we're going to expand it. And Steve Bosrock, who's coming in to lead marketing is well aware of that approach. He's done it before and I think we'll add another level of leadership there. And then on the sales side, very happy to have Kirk Ellis coming on board, a very strong leader with experience in GI, he's been in two different startups, with a lot of GI experience both of them are now part of established leaders in the field. So you've got an existing customer relationships and I think we'll be well placed. We'll work together then to decide what else we're going to do from a \u2013 building out the team element to that. We have a healthy tension within Apollo between driving growth, but also still keeping a very tight lid on costs. I can tell you, I've already approved less than a handful of some additional sales rep positions in key markets and we're going to fill those. And then we're going to be very smart in terms of how we continue to think about adding. But we've got great growth opportunities. We got to be smart about it and keep investing in the future. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Yes, that's obviously great to hear. And then as far as the guidance goes, I understand there's still a lot of uncertainty out there. But obviously, the guidance does look a little bit conservative from the normalized growth basis, just with a really strong Q1 here. So maybe you could kind of just help us understand what you're assuming as far as contribution from X-Tack and that number maybe what you're assuming for COVID US versus OUS? And then any other inputs we should really be thinking about there? Stefanie Cavanaugh : So, it's a good question and it's fair and accurate to say that we are being careful in our guidance, for sure. X-Tack is in its early stages, and for competitive reasons, we're not going to break out X-Tack separately. And what we can share Chas has already spoken to from the previous questions. So today, we are remaining careful about what we are estimating for our organization, and as more information becomes available to us about X-Tack and utilization and account additions. We'll let that \u2013 as well as the other things we've talked about COVID recovery related items impact on OverStitch growth OUS in the areas where we're experiencing some disruptions. As well as, what might be transit with respect to our IGB revenue, once we pull all of that together, and as the recovery continues then we will look to improve upon what we are estimating today. But for today, we think that the prudent, wise position to be in is a more careful number. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Understand. And then last one for me just as far as MERIT goes, just wondering if you could speak to \u2013 assuming the data is positive, how quickly you expect the payer behavior to change? How compelling do you expect it to be to payers and then where would you expect pushback to be if at all? Charles McKhann : Sure. No, good question. First of all, we don't know the data is still being run independently by the investigators. We are optimistic, as it's been described on prior calls. Given the history of how much data has been already developed on X-Tack \u2013 I'm sorry on ESG. And so for those who you're new on the call to Apollo and we've got multiple studies encompassing thousands of patients, demonstrating the procedure. So, we're optimistic. So, in the data, once we get that -- reimbursement is a journey. I've lived that journey in other environments. We are working on specific strategies and it involves coding, coverage, and payment around both government CMS reimbursement, as well as with commercial payers. We are aware of already some examples of some of our customers who have coverage relationships with individual payers. And that's really good news. It's really exciting. So, some of the field is starting to be laid there. But to answer your question, I would expect some impact beginning of next year, but then I see that taking then a number of years after that to continue to build exactly what that pace will be. We're working through those plans and at some point, we will get to the point of doing things like reporting on number of covered lives and how fast that ramp is, but we're not there yet. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Stefanie Cavanaugh : Thanks Drew. Operator : I would now like to turn the floor back to Charles for closing remarks. Charles McKhann : Great. Thank you very much. It's been a busy and energizing first couple of months. And I do anticipate maintaining our positive momentum throughout 2021 and as we work across the many opportunities in front of us. I'm excited to see OverStitch emerging as a standard-of-care in multiple GI applications that call for full fitness suturing and in addition, we believe that physicians see the enormous potential of ESG as a primary weight loss procedure. X-Tack is off to a solid start and is receiving very positive feedback from physician users. And we are very enthusiastic about this new product, and the opportunity to expand our market with another truly innovative and flexible tool for various GI needs. And with Orbera breakthrough designation, the new CPT codes, and a recent AGA practice guidelines, the franchise is once again emerging as a strategic growth opportunity for Apollo. And so as we look forward, I said it before, I'll say it again. We look forward to leveraging all three of these exciting products to energize the business, then accelerate growth over time, and ultimately, lead the field of therapeutic endoscopy. If you have any questions or would like to arrange a call with us, please contact Matt Kreps from Darrow Associates. Matt\u2019s contact information is on our website and in today's press release. And thank you and have a great evening. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's event. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day.

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions and comments following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Matt Kreps. Sir, the floor is yours. Matt Kreps : Thank you, Catherine, and thanks, everyone, for participating in today's call to discuss Apollo's second quarter 2021 financial and operating results. Joining me on the call are Chas McKhann, Chief Executive Officer; Stefanie Cavanaugh, our Chief Financial Officer. And also joining today's call is Jeff Black, our Incoming Chief Financial Officer, who will officially assume his duty upon filing of our second quarter Form 10-Q. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal Securities laws, including Apollo's financial outlook and Apollo's plans and timing for product development and sales. In addition, there is uncertainty about the continued spread of the COVID-19 virus and the ongoing impact it may have on our operations, the demand for our products, global supply chain and economic activity in general. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties and cause actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2020, filed previously with the Securities and Exchange Commission and our most recent Form 10-Q. The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, August 3, 2021. Except as required by law, Apollo undertakes no obligation to revise or update any statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. And now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chas. Chas McKhann : Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Our strong momentum continued into the second quarter, driving our fourth straight quarter of sales growth. In the release that just crossed the wire, we reported record sales for endoscopy products of $16.6 million for the second quarter, leading us to increase our revenue guidance for the full year from $55 million to $57 million to now $61 million to $63 million. You may remember that my first call with you in May, I laid out a growth strategy with three phases : to energize the business, accelerate growth and lead from the front. Our investor deck available online includes a slide describing the three phases in more detail. The results are reported a clearly aligned with the first phase, energize as we seek to deliver transformational growth at Apollo. The energized phase is all about building momentum by driving near-term performance and achieving strategic milestones that will lay the foundation for years of sustainable growth. Customer demand for our products is increasing around the world, and we are seeing that reflected in our performance despite ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic. In addition to delivering record revenue for our Endoscopic Suturing and Intragastric Balloon businesses, we made substantial progress on many key initiatives. These include : first, transforming our senior leadership team with the recent appointments of Kirk Ellis, our VP of U.S. Sales: Steve Bosrock, our VP of Marketing and Medical Education; and Jeff Black, our Incoming CFO, who started this week and is with us on today's call. Second, strengthen and expanding our sales team. In the U.S., we have hired back 4 experienced sales reps, all of whom are fully trained on our products and were previously top performers. In addition, we have recently opened 6 additional new U.S. sales positions and some key positions in our international team to further improve coverage and allow our sales team to focus on driving growth in high priority geographies. Third, announcing that the MERIT study investigators have reported that in a preliminary analysis, the trial has achieved its primary efficacy and safety endpoints. And fourth, continuing the successful launch of our novel X-Tack Helix Tacking System with more than 120 active sites at the end of Q2. Since starting at Apollo earlier this year, I've been engaging with customers continually as have many on our leadership team. We consistently are feedback that physicians love our products, and now they also show our excitement for the revitalization that is taking place in Apollo. Turning now to updates on each of our product lines, starting with OverStitch. We continue to see strong OverStitch demand from our core users. We are very pleased to see that in Q2, growth of OverStitch was driven by an increase in both the total number of accounts ordering and the average revenue per account. This tells me that we are successfully growing the base of physicians who are trained and using OverStitch while also increasing adoption among our experienced users. Our mobile learning lab is back on the road training physicians on our products and our training programs continue to evolve to best meet the needs of physicians. We work closely with physician societies, such as the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, the ASGE, who just last week, hosted an excellent training program focused on Endoscopic Suturing with OverStitch. Outside the U.S., we are seeing strong results despite periodic COVID flare-ups in various markets around the world. Mike Gutteridge and our international team have done a remarkable job navigating these complex market dynamics in the first half of the year and conditions continue to improve in most of our markets. We do anticipate the disruptions from COVID will continue to pop up, but we are seeing broad basis of improvements in both our direct and distributor markets that we expect will continue to build in the second half of the year. Perhaps one of the most significant OverStitch milestones to date came in June at the Surgical Disruptive Technology Summit, where the MERIT study investigators announced that based on a preliminary analysis, the study has achieved its primary endpoints for both efficacy and safety. I'm pleased to now report that the MERIT study results have been accepted for a presentation by the International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders, otherwise known as IFSO, at their annual meeting in Miami in October. Based on the positive announcement about the MERIT trial endpoints, we anticipate filing a de novo submission with the FDA for a new indication for weight loss, most likely in the third quarter. In addition, we are initiating preparation for a comprehensive launch of the ESG procedure at the time of a new indication. We are very excited about this milestone because we believe ESG has the potential to be transformative, not just for our business but also to the millions of patients worldwide looking for weight loss solution that better fits their needs. As a reminder, there are more than 100 million adults in the U.S. alone with a BMI greater than 30 and there is a vast unmet clinical need for new treatment options. Our sense of optimism for ESG stems directly from what we hear from our customers who are expressing rising enthusiasm on 2 dimensions : first, that the ESG value proposition resonates very well with patients. And second, that they have been experienced success offering both provider-driven cash pay solutions as well as some positive case-by-case reimbursement decisions by private payers. Turning to X-Tack. The customer response continues to be very promising. On our May call, we announced that we had added over 50 accounts in the first quarter, and I'm pleased to say that we are now more than 120 accounts in the U.S. We also have initiated our OUS launch in select countries, including Hong Kong, Chile and Israel and are making plans for additional markets. Our OUS X-Tack launch will be targeted to select markets initially, while we work through the new procedures to gain CE Mark in Europe, which we believe will be a 2022 event. Our U.S. X-Tack rollout initially targeted experienced OverStitch users, which made good sense and generated initial interest in the product. Awareness about X-Tack continues to build in the GI community. And at the end of the second quarter, we have a pipeline of approximately 80 additional prospective accounts worth approximately $650,000 of initial orders to be delivered upon completion. That said, under the direction of Kirk Ellis and Steve Bosrock, our new commercial leadership team in the U.S. is increasingly focusing sales activities on driving additional utilization with any key targeted institutions rather than simply opening up a large number of new accounts. We believe this approach can generate more sustainable success by having multiple users at each hospital, including many who are not existing OverStitch users and create highly experienced advocates who see X-Tack as a vital tool that they rely on frequently for their closure needs. We are also supporting multiple clinical evaluations of X-Tack with several papers in development based on initial cases that have already been completed, and we look forward to the first clinical publications in the months ahead. We anticipate that these studies will further document X-Tack unique benefits and ease of use in the closure applications for which it was specifically designed. In short, we are very pleased with the initial clinical performance of this highly differentiated and effective product, and we look forward to building on its initial success going forward. Recognizing that these are simply anecdotes allow me to share some additional comments that we've just recently received about X-Tack. A physician within a large VA hospital shared, \u201cX-Tack is going to be the new normal in endoscopic repairs.\u201d From a user at a major medical center said, \u201cX-Tack has good applications and can replace the need for a lot of endocrips.\u201d And finally, a message from another KOL physician after their first case. \u201cI absolutely love the X-Tack device. I used it last week for the first time on a very challenging case, the X-Tack system worked beautifully, I'm 100% obsessed.\u201d This enthusiasm from our customers, driven by delivering better patient care and real clinical success is very roto our entire team, but especially to our R&D engineers who develop this outstanding product. And completing the product update, ORBERA continues to demonstrate very compelling performance on a global basis, achieving the best revenue quarter since the very early days of the launch of the U.S. I continue to believe that this is a potentially underappreciated asset. We're seeing growing market adoption of IGB as a less invasive but effective weight loss solution for those needing something more effective than diet and exercise alone. ORBERA is the leading IGB the market leader globally with an unmatched body of clinical evidence, excellent weight loss results and excellent value for the patient. A recent publication of new clinical practice guidelines by the American Gastroenterology Association have been very well received, and there were many positive sessions about the lower balloon therapy at the 2021 Digestive Disease Week meeting in May. Looking ahead, we believe the recent positive announcement of new Category I CPT codes for IGB procedures and the FDA breakthrough designation for the treatment of NASH further bolster the potential value of this franchise. We are now seeing rapidly rising interest among physicians in building dedicated endobariatric practices, another development in favor of ORBERA. The ASGE has created a specialty group called the Association of Bariatric Endoscopy that is focused on developing this emerging field. In addition, there were multiple sessions of the DBL view meeting about developing successful endobariatric practices, which include the placement of Intragastric Balloon such as ORBERA as one of the cornerstone procedures offered to patients. Over time, we believe that Endoscopic Suturing, including both primary ESG procedures and endoscopic revisions of prior bariatric surgeries could become the second cornerstone. Apollo's product lines are uniquely positioned to support this emerging field. And briefly an update on our ORBERA for NASH. Recall that non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, is a debilitating condition that impacts millions of patients and is one of the leading conditions that cause the need for a liver transplant. In February, we received a breakthrough designation for ORBERA for this new indication of NASH. We continue to work on potential designs for a NASH pivotal trial, and we'll continue to make additional updates on this as it becomes in a better focus. FDA's breakthrough designation was a seminal event for us and an affirmation of IGB's full potential as a therapeutic solution. With this update, I hope to have conveyed the tremendous sense of excitement and momentum that permeates Apollo right now. In my first two quarters as CEO, I've had the pleasure of hearing directly from our customers how positively they view Apollo's products. And in addition, our team here at Apollo has a passion for improving patient care and a dedication to advancing the field of therapeutic endoscopy. We are well positioned to deliver continued growth with large opportunities across all 3 of our product lines. We continue to build our capabilities, including addition to our sales and marketing team, and we work to scale supply and expand our volumes across all 3 platforms and move towards the accelerate phase of our growth strategy. With that, I'll turn the call over to Stefanie to cover the second quarter financial results. Stef? Stefanie Cavanaugh : Thank you, Chas, and good afternoon, everyone. The second quarter of 2021 demonstrated strong growth, leading to record endoscopy revenue. This is indicative of our strong momentum as well as our recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, even with some U.S. states and OUS countries continuing to experience periodic COVID surges, which has continued to limit access in certain health care systems. Total revenue was $16.6 million, up 20% sequentially from the first quarter and 194% over the second quarter of 2020. ESS revenue increased 196% and IGB revenue increased 220% versus the prior year. Both product lines demonstrated large increases in both the U.S. and OUS markets, as demand for our products has continued to increase exiting the pandemic. As a reminder, X-Tack sales are included in our ESS results, which we don't intend to disclose separately at this time, but we did cross the $1 million mark in X-Tack sales since the launch in Q1. OUS markets performed well in the quarter as activity continued to increase as more of our markets recover from the effects of the pandemic. In particular, we are very pleased with performance of our direct markets in Europe. Despite COVID-related shutdowns in a number of countries in Q2, our European direct markets delivered 190% growth compared to the prior year quarter and 24% sequential growth as both OverStitch and ORBERA demand improved. This strong Q2 performance gives us confidence in the growing market opportunities for both product lines in key markets around the world. Gross margin also continued to improve, increasing to 55% due to higher sales and the accretive contribution from X-Tack, which was designed from the beginning to be accretive to our historical consolidated gross margin. In addition, we continue to make progress on our internal program of gross margin improvement projects. Operating expenses increased as we expanded investment in growth initiatives, including strategic hiring in our marketing and sales organization as well as higher stock-based compensation expense as compared to the cost controls we implemented during the pandemic in the prior year. Operating loss also increased to $5.2 million, primarily as a result of the non-cash stock compensation expense I just mentioned. We recorded a $2.9 million benefit on the forgiveness of the PPP loan this quarter, resulting in a net loss of $3 million or $0.11 per share. Excluding the non-cash stock compensation and loan forgiveness, our net loss improved 42% compared to the second quarter of 2020 and 14% on a sequential basis this year. Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash position remained strong at $31.2 million compared with $32.6 million at the end of the first quarter, a decline of just over $1 million as the $2 million used for operations this quarter was offset by $1 million of stock option proceeds. As Chas mentioned at the beginning, we are pleased to have delivered a solid first half and increased our full year revenue target from the $55 million to $57 million estimated on our last call to the $61 million to $63 million today, representing a $6 million increase and annual revenue growth of 45% to 50%. A number of continued uncertainties are reflected in that range. We continue to anticipate ongoing uncertainty around the impact of COVID-19 variance in certain markets, particularly OUS in the second half of 2021. We also anticipate a typical seasonal summer slowdown in procedure volumes in the third quarter. And finally, we are still in the early days of our X-Tack product launch and continue to learn about the likely growth in new accounts and X-Tack utilization over time. Chas McKhann : Thanks, Stefanie. And before we move to Q&A, I would like to officially welcome and introduce Jeff Black, who joins Apollo as CFO this week. Jeff brings 30 years of experience to Apollo Endosurgery, most recently, he served as Chief Financial Officer at Alphatec Holdings, a medical technology company providing spinal fusion solutions. Jeff played a key role in the successful turnaround of the company, securing nearly $500 million in financing to support accelerated growth, transform the balance sheet and execute strategic acquisitions. Under his leadership, Alphatec grew from a market capitalization of $20 million to more than $1.5 billion. I would also like to thank Stefanie for an invaluable contribution to Apollo over the past 6 years, and I'm very pleased that Steph will be continuing on with us as we position the company for the next phase of growth. Stefanie, thank you, and Jeff, welcome to Apollo. Jeffrey Black : Thank you, Chas, and good afternoon, everybody. I could not be happier to be joining Chas and the team during a very exciting time for the company. There's a tremendous opportunity ahead of us to improve patient lives, to transform and even expand a very large and growing market with truly differentiated technology and all with the eye toward continuing to build shareholder value. Stef's built a very strong finance foundation here at Apollo. I look forward to partnering her with her as we prudently scale the organization to support our plans for accelerated growth. Many of you on this call, I know and looking forward to getting reconnected and reacquainted. Others, I don't, and looking forward to getting to know you in the coming days and weeks. With that, that concludes our prepared remarks, and I'll turn it back over to the operator for questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum. Your line is live. Matt Hewitt : Good afternoon, and congratulations on the very strong quarter and welcome, Jeff. Chas McKhann : Thanks, Matt. Jeffrey Black : Thank you. Matt Hewitt : First off, obviously, a big bounce back from where we were a year ago, a relatively easy comp, given what happened a year ago, but we're still seeing pockets that you were able to put up some really strong numbers. How much of that do you think was some pent-up demand versus just the growth that you're seeing in new sites offering X-Tack, OverStitch, ORBERA coming back? Is there a way to kind of parse through it and see where that growth is coming from? Chas McKhann : Yeah, Matt. We actually think this is real growth, right? As you recall, we had a little bit of a bounce back in Q3 of last year, and it had by our circular terms, a very strong Q3, especially when you factor in seasonality. Since then, we've been growing quarter-on-quarter since then. And so, the underlying demand across all 3 products is really driving that growth. Yes, of course, X-Tack is incremental, and we're happy about that. But we're also seeing really strong performances with both OverStitch and with the blue franchise. Matt Hewitt : That's great. And then, I guess, pointing to X-Tack, obviously, a fantastic quarter of additions to the sites. And I'm curious, have you - is there a learning curve on getting through some of these hospital committees that you've kind of figured out, now it should enable you to get through the next 80 quicker? Or is it just every site is different and you kind of got to go through a different process with each of them? Chas McKhann : It's a little bit of both, Matt. We certainly can learn some best practices as we've been through it now. But you are right, every hospital has their own processes. And some of them that we thought would go quickly, have taken longer and others have moved really rapidly. It's hard to predict. This is an area that it helps as we continue to build the team just to have more folks available to sort of shepherd that and manage the process. But I'd also reiterate, we also are very much focusing the team and we're happy to continue to take on additional customers and work through the process. But we're really focusing our sales team, especially with the new commercial leadership on depth of utilization. We want to make sure not only get the product on the shelf, but to make sure that we're targeting multiple users in each account and have it become part of the practice. And that takes some work, right? That's changing behavior in medicine and getting them used to using the product and incorporating in their day-today practice. But we're seeing positive examples of that, and that's going to be really our primary focus. Matt Hewitt : Okay. That's great. Maybe one last one and then I'll hop back in the queue. Regarding the new salespeople. So you added 4 domestic here in the quarter. It sounds like you've got a few more openings that you're going to be hopefully filling. Could you give us an update what is your current headcount for both the domestic sales team and then the international direct markets? Thank you. Chas McKhann : For the domestic sales team, we have - with the four additions, we have 20 sales reps and then a total team of about 25 people, many account managers and another role. The\u2026 Stefanie Cavanaugh : OUS is similar. Chas McKhann : Yeah, OUS is a similar size, would give you the exact number, but it's very similar in scale. Matt Hewitt : That's great. Thank you very much, and congratulations. Chas McKhann : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Your next question is coming from Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler. Your line is live. Adam Maeder : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the great quarter and echo Matt's comments. Jeff, welcome aboard. And congrats on the new role and Stef kudos to you on a job well done. Maybe just to start with one on the guidance. I was hoping you could kind of rehash that a little bit for us. Just walk through the different components there, assumptions for the different segments in the business. I think, Stefanie, you talked a little bit about seasonality in Q3 and maybe some conservatism around the delta variant or COVID. So, is it reasonable to assume that there's something baked in there for those items? And then just broad strokes, thinking about the cadence in the back half of the year, Q3 versus Q4, I would be curious in getting some color there as well. And I had a follow-up or two. Chas McKhann : Sure. Thanks, Adam. As we look to the back half of the year, we don't break out the individual products, but as you can see from our results, we're seeing growth across all three product lines. So we're excited about that. We - as I said in the comments, we absolutely are expecting recepted a seasonal effect. I mean, last year is obviously a little bit of an outlier. But if you go back to 2019 and even before that, we have historically shown a seasonal impact. And if anything, it may be more pronounced this year, right? Think about just vacations and schedules. We have a big international business, as you know. And so, European holidays in August, all indications are, if they used to take two weeks, they might take three, right? Just - so the seasonal impact is real, and we're certainly planning for some of that I think the COVID piece, as I mentioned in my comments, I've been very impressed with how the team has managed through it, but we certainly see examples. And I think we used to talk about coming out of COVID. I'm not sure what the new norm will be in terms of COVID going forward, but we're certainly watching that carefully primarily outside the U.S., but occasional pockets here, so far, not a major impact in the U.S., but Louisiana, Florida are markets that all of us are watching for obvious reasons. And then just on the learning curve of X-Tack, it hadn't been in humans before six months ago. So we're still learning the uptake in both new accounts and utilization. So, all of those are factored into the range and certainly would see a seasonal impact in Q3. And historically, Q4 is a strong quarter for us. Adam Maeder : That's really helpful, Chas. Thanks for all the color there. And then if I can sneak in two more. There were a handful of positive updates given on the call today. So, maybe just starting with OverStitch and the MERIT study. I guess, the question here is, really on how do you think about a potential impact from a reimbursement or a payer perspective? When could that come to fruition? Is that a 2022 or 2023 event? And then you gave the update on the de novo submission for a weight loss indication. I think you said that's most likely a Q3 filing. I'm assuming that means ESG-specific label. Do I have that right? And is that potentially kind of a mid-2022 item? And then I'll sneak in one more, if that's okay, after that. Chas McKhann : Sure. The - so ESG in the development, you're right, the two major milestones in front of us will be the presentation of the MERIT data itself and then using that towards an indication. And as I mentioned on the call, we are working feverishly and would hope to have that the submission for the novo potentially this quarter. That's a 6- to 12-month process depending on the level of questions. And so, in our investor deck, we have a kind of wide range of first half of next year, and we'll update it as we learn more on that. And I focus on the indication because I think it's an important part of the answer to your question about reimbursement. As I mentioned in my comments, we're already seeing examples of our customers. And again, we're not promoting it, right? This is our customers independently following two models, both a cash pay model as well as a case-by-case reimbursement model, prior authorizations using existing unlisted codes and do it quite successfully. And I would say, especially for revisions of bariatric surgeries. And so, we're in the learning stage right now to seeing what they are doing and where they're having success and then what actions we can then would be able to appropriately take if and when we have the indication. And those two models, both cash pay and the case-by-case reimbursement with an indication, we think can be very successful in driving a lot of growth. While we would have been working on, I think the basis of your question, the broader coding coverage and payment that will need to also take place. And so we have plans in place to pursue the procedural codes, so things like new APC codes and as well as inpatient, but it is primarily an outpatient procedure. So the new codes there. Those can happen pretty quickly in terms of the filing after the indications, but then often take a fair amount of time to again put into place, so probably more of a 2023 kind of event. And then the CPT coding, the societies drive that, and they're working through it, but that also will take some time. As you know, the balloon codes we just got approvals for, they don't go into place until 2023. And so, if anything, ESG will probably be at least a year later than that just because you need the data, we needed to work through the processes. But again, summarizing, I'd say we've got a lot of opportunities in hearing now even using the existing practices that our customers are already pursuing. Adam Maeder : That's a great update. Thanks for that. And if I can sneak in just one more. Maybe transitioning to ORBERA and the NASH indication. It sounds like the path forward there in terms of trial design is still a little bit in progress or development. Can you give us any flavor at this point in time in terms of kind of what you think will be required from a clinical trial standpoint in terms of number of patients or follow-up? Just trying to get some sort of rough sense for when this could be on label in the States. Thanks, again, and congrats on the strong performance. Chas McKhann : Yeah. Thanks, Adam. The - not much of an update, honestly, on the NASH just because we're still working through - I think I mentioned on the last call, there are a lot of benefits to the breakthrough designation. But one of the elements we get is that we end up working with not one of the two agencies on the design of the trial because they both have a say in what it looks like. And so, we're working with them on the design, and I'm optimistic that we'll get that work through in a reasonable course. But it's hard to speculate on exactly what the trial will look like until we're a little further along in that process. And so we're working on it, and we'll provide an update once we have something tangible. Adam Maeder : Sounds good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Frank Takkinen from Lake Street. Frank Takkinen : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. And I echo previous comments about welcome, Jeff, and thanks for everything you've done, Stef. It's been a fantastic run and glad to see you sticking on board for the remainder of the year at the minimum. Couple questions from me. I wanted to first start with X-Tack. I heard your comments about both new accounts as well as utilization. I was hoping, one, you could kind of help us frame the broader total account opportunity beyond the 200 - 120 plus 80 so far as well as some of the utilization trends you are seeing in the early days and how you believe utilization can trend over time and to what level some of your higher-level users may get to? Chas McKhann : Yes. The - so first, on the account universe, one of the exercises that we've done with the new - since the new team has come on board is, we purchased very detailed level data on procedures and we get to by account and by physician of relevant procedures, for example, mucosal resection procedures that are being done in the goal. And from that, we can glean a pretty good understanding of where the procedure volumes are both within the hospital setting as well as within the ASC setting. And based off of those data, we've got a pretty good indication that there could be as many as 1,500 to 2,000 accounts in the U.S. Now that all remains to be seen, but that's based off of real data with - and with a pretty high cutoff in terms of how many procedures they're doing each year. So, we're still in the early days of this. And more importantly, we're going to focus, as I said, on the high - and even within that data, I mentioned the sort of broader universe at the top levels of that universe to get depth in those institutions. To the second question, the utilization, frankly, we're still learning on that. I mean, what we continue to hear is that X-Tack has applicability to a broader user base than OverStitch. It's pretty common for OverStitch to have, say, a couple of users within - even a pretty large account because of the learning curve involved with OverStitch. And - but in some of our early accounts with X-Tack, we see examples of the four or five physicians or more who are already interested and others who are learning about it. So, at an account level, the utilization potential will really be dependent on our ability to identify and train and engage multiple users who then incorporate into their practice. And so, as we get more data and more experience than we may be decision to give you sort of firmer numbers on that, but that's what we're focused on right now. Frank Takkinen : Got it. That makes sense. And then transitioning over to OverStitch, could you - or ESS in general, could you break out a little bit more the - some of the puts and takes driving the strength in the quarter? And specifically, could you maybe speak to ESG trends, growth rates, if you have anything of that nature you could share with us? Chas McKhann : Well, what I said in the opening comments broadly is we have seen a growth in the number of accounts using in the quarter as well as the average per account. And so the number of accounts, which in the U.S. is now at 400 accounts who are actively using in Q3 - sorry, Q2. And that's driven by both our core GI, so call it non-bariatric. In fact, that's where a lot of people often start using OverStitch, especially if they are GIs. And I mentioned, we're doing a lot of training programs, you've seen bring people on there. And then we also are growing in the revenue per account, and that can be both from the core GI side as well as from the bariatric practices. I think we want to get a little bit more experience and certainly get into the zone of having a new indication to really be able to talk through the sort of endobariatric opportunity. But suffice it to say that we certainly have examples of a number of customers who have embraced that opportunity and being quite successful using both of the payment models that I mentioned before. Frank Takkinen : Got it. And then last one for me. OpEx is a little bit elevated. That makes sense with a strong quarter. I applaud spending to grow the business, establish as a standard of care. I was curious if we should look at Q2 as a run rate on a go-forward basis or if there is anything specific in the operating expense, we should know about that may not recur on a go-forward basis. Stefanie Cavanaugh : No, I think you're right. It is indicative of the future moving forward. What I would point out, however, is a fair amount of the increase from Q1 to Q2 is a noncash stock comp related item. And when you get to our Q filing, you'll be able to see all that broken out in the footprint in our cash flow reports. But essentially, that went up quite a bit from Q1 to Q2 for all of the performance-related options and stock units given our good performance. So, we expect that trend to continue move into the moving forward quarters. Frank Takkinen : Perfect. Thank you for taking all my questions. Operator : We have no further questions from the lines at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back to Chas McKhann for closing remarks. Chas McKhann : Thank you, Catherine, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. It's been a busy and rewarding second quarter, and we've got even more excitement for the second half of the year as we continue to energize the business and pursue attractive opportunities. If you have any questions you would like to arrange a call with us, please contact Matt Kreps from Darrow Associates. Thank you, and have a great evening. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time, and a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Apollo Endosurgery\u2019s Third Quarter 2021 Results. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Matt Kreps. Sir, the floor is yours. Matt Kreps : Thank you and thanks everyone for participating in today\u2019s call to discuss Apollo\u2019s third quarter 2021 financial and operating results. Joining me on the call are Charles McKhann, Chief Executive Officer and Jeff Black, our Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call will include slides to accompany the audio presentation. For those of you joining us by telephone, you can download a copy of the slides at our Investor Relations site, ir.apolloendo.com in choosing Events and Presentations. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including Apollo\u2019s financial outlook and Apollo\u2019s plans and timing for product development and sales. In addition, there is uncertainty about the continued spread of the COVID-19 virus and the ongoing impact it may have on our operations, the demand for our products, global supply chains and economic activity in general. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties and Apollo\u2019s actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2020 filed previously with the Securities and Exchange Commission and our most recent Form 10-Q. The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of this live broadcast, November 1, 2021. Except as required by law Apollo undertakes no obligation to revise or update any statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. Additionally, today\u2019s discussion will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide an additional tool for evaluating the company\u2019s core performance. Management uses these metrics in its own evaluation and continued operating performance and a baseline for assessing the future earnings potential of the company. Included in the press release issued today with our financial results and corresponding 8-K filing are supplemental tables reconciling non-GAAP figures to their closest GAAP comparable. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Charles. Charles McKhann : Thanks, Matt and thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon to discuss our results for the third quarter and participating in the webcast format as well. Today marks my 8-month anniversary since joining as CEO of Apollo. And so in addition to covering the quarter, I also want to give an update on what we have accomplished in the first 8 months and perspectives on where we are heading going forward. On the first call that I did after Q1, I laid out a strategy that we have been implementing over three phases to energize the business, put us in a position to then accelerate and then lead over time. And that has involved really forming a new leadership team that it takes the best of Apollo and great people that we had on board and then supplementing that with some key additions as we focus and go after some really large market opportunities. And so I am very pleased to then report today the progress that we have made. In that energized phase, the first phase of our growth strategy, we really talked about three main areas of focus : strengthening and revitalizing the team, delivering on near-term growth and building a foundation for future success. And as you can see on the slide, we are very pleased with the progress we have made across all three of them. On the team, we have made some additions to the leadership team, including Jeff Black, our CFO, who is with me here today, as well as additions to our sales and marketing organization. We also have been building out the team on the ground. We started \u2013 in the U.S. we had 16 sales reps, which was not enough frankly to adequately cover the large country that we have here. And so by the end of the year, we are projecting to have as many as 30 reps. And so a nice addition, including bringing back some experienced reps from Apollo as well as hiring others who are very experienced in the GI space. We have also made other targeted additions into key functions around the organization as we build to scale the business. And then we have also been very outwardly facing with our customers, spending time, meeting with them, talking about our plans for the future and really engaging and enrolling them in where we want to go with the business. Secondly, we have delivered on the near-term growth. We are very pleased with the results for the quarter, but also, if you look year-to-date, we have got 60% growth spread equally across our endoscopic suturing business and our intragasic balloons and also quite equally across U.S. and outside the U.S. So, the word I use, as I look at our growth so far this year it\u2019s balance, really nice balance across products and across geographies. And then the X-Tack launch has been a big component of that as well. And we are very pleased with the success of the X-Tack launch and the progress we are making and I will provide some updates there as well. And then all the while, we are building a foundation for future opportunities. Just about 10 days ago, we announced the results from the MERIT study at the IPSO meeting and I am going to touch on those. We also just this morning announced the first clinical publication for X-Tack. We have submitted the FDA a de novo 510(k) submission for Apollo ESG and Apollo revise, a critical step for us in developing a new indication for endoscopic weight loss for the OverStitch device. Early in the year, we got our breakthrough designation for the Orbera balloon for the treatment of NASH, and we continue to make progress on designing the path forward for a huge opportunity in front of us with NASH potentially. And then we also have the X-Tack approval that we\u2019ve received in Australia, which we\u2019ve already gotten the approval in some of the other markets around the world, but this is another important one and sets us up, we think, well, for more approvals outside the U.S. in the coming months. And then last, but certainly not least, we completed the fund base here in just a few weeks ago, which helped strengthen our balance sheet and positions us for future growth. So, some key metrics. As we look through the quarter, I mentioned already 60% year-on-year growth. Clearly, 2020 was a difficult and challenging year and also a strange comparison. So you can see 33% growth compared to 2019, equally spread across our ESS and IGB businesses and an issuing metric also that our top 10 accounts, direct accounts in both U.S. and outside the U.S. have grown 100% year-on-year, so really building nice depth while also expanding the breadth of our business in new accounts as well X-Tack, as I mentioned, is progressing well. And a key metric there is that in the third quarter, 72% of our sales came from utilization from reorders. And that\u2019s important because that\u2019s showing real usage, real utilization, while we also, in addition, continue to open additional accounts as well. We are very pleased with the publication for X-Tack that just came out. It\u2019s a multi-center trial, 93 patients, excellent centers involved, including the Meo, Johns Hopkins, New York University. So this is the first clinical publication for X-Tack. Remember, it\u2019s a very new product for us. And as you \u2013 if you had a chance to see the press release we issued today, demonstrated excellent efficacy and results in that publication. And then the MERIT trial, a big milestone for us, as I mentioned, was presented, and I will touch on that here in just a minute. So the MERIT study, I think many on the call are familiar with it, but if you\u2019re new to Apollo and are not, it is a randomized controlled trial of our ESG procedure, which utilizes the OverStitch device. So, ESG is an endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty. And this was a trial that was randomized to patients who receive ESG versus a standard of care of medically monitored diet and exercise. It enrolled 208 subjects with a BMI between 30 and 40. We have \u2013 are very thankful to the principal investigators, Dr. Barmabadeo from Ameo Clinic, a leading GI in the field; and Dr. Eric Wilson from the University of Texas or Houston, a leading surgeon. And so we have had a close partnership throughout the study on GI and surgeons. You can see the primary end points of the study on the page, excess body weight loss of at least 25% and safety, having a serious adverse event rate of less than 5%. We also importantly enrolled patients, a pre-specified number of patients with hypertension and patients with type 2 diabetes. Some of the highlights of the presentation that was made by Dr. Abada, again, at a virtual session from IFSO are presented here on this slide. We achieved a 49% excess body weight loss at 12 months or patients did who underwent ESG. That was compared to a target of 25%. And importantly, the targets were developed based off of a 2011 white paper that was developed by the ASGE, which is a gastroenterology society and the ASMBS, which is a surgical society. And they set out guidelines for endoscopic weight loss therapies and a target of at least a 25% excess body weight loss was used to set the primary end point. Importantly, there was a 45% difference in excess body weight loss compared to control versus a target of 15%. 77% of patients achieved at least a 25% excess body weight loss and the SAE rate as defined by the investigators was 2% and all patients recovered from those events. The \u2013 importantly, as you see on the right side of the page, we also exhibited very good durability in the study. So after 2 years, patients maintained the majority of the weight loss out to 2 years as well as the crossover patients who received ESG had excellent results. As I mentioned, one of the other key metrics or areas that we looked at in the study was the impact on comorbidities. And as you can see on the slide, we\u2019re very pleased with the results on comorbidities. Metabolic syndrome, significant improvements, 82%, 83% improvement in metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes, and hypertension also showed significant differences compared to control. Same was true with quality of life as measured by a standard questionnaire called the SF36. Another interesting finding is around GERD. The ESG procedure preserves the function of the stomach. And one of the evidence of that, that we saw was actually a reduction in GERD symptoms and no new or worsening GERD, which is an interesting finding because traditional bariatric surgeries actually often result in an increase in GERD symptoms. So this is important clinically and a nice finding from the MERIT study. And so these results, along with other data in support of ESG have formed the basis for the de novo submission, and we will look to continue dialogue with FDA about that in the coming months. So with that update on the quarter, let me take a step back and provide a little bit of an update on where we view the company going over the coming years and vision for where we\u2019re heading. To start with, we are serving large market opportunities. We have three products, the X-Tack, OverStitch and Revera products across two large business opportunities, what we call advanced GI and our endoscopic weight loss opportunities. In addition, in the future, we have a third potential opportunity in the area of NASH, which is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. So, three product lines, big opportunities that we are already being able to build some really nice momentum in. And one of the things I really like as I look across each of the 3 product lines is that we\u2019ve got really nice opportunities for growth and value creation over the near term, medium term and over time. With OverStitch, we continue to increase the number of users and the range of applications for the product, again, across both of those two main areas and are building a foundation for growth in the weight loss area. As I mentioned, we\u2019ve submitted to the FDA for a new indication and if that submission is successful, we would be in a position to then launch ESG, Apollo ESG and Apollo Revised in the coming months. In addition, over time, we can see that establishing endoscopic weight loss as a standard of care. For X-Tack, we are pleased with the development here in the U.S., primarily right now in terms of building utilization and experience. Over time, we will be able to move that into a global product line as evidenced by some of the near-term approvals. But likely a CE mark, which is the European approval, is more of a 2022 event. And over time, we see the combination of X-Tack and OverStitch, putting us in a position to create a leadership position in defect closure. And then the Orbera Agograstic balloon has been performing very well, as you can see in our results. There are new AGA guidelines, AGA, the American Gastroenterology Association issued clinical practice guidelines earlier this year and the market conditions have been favorable. Over time, we see the balloon as a key component of an integrated endobariatric weight loss practice that can incorporate both balloons and suturing options. And then in addition, we are working on the trial design for a new indication for NASH, which will create a brand-new pathway to have the balloon potentially be reimbursed for those patients. So, moving through each of the products, OverStitch in that advanced GI therapies, it really is the flagship product for the company. It is \u2013 creates a unique offering of being able to do what are called full thickness futures through the stomach. Primarily, we\u2019ve been growing through training, through medical education, new users, different applications, developing additional procedures and data. And you can see the procedure mix, right, about 60% of our business in the U.S. for OverStitch, are these advanced GI applications. Outside the U.S., it\u2019s more heavily weighted to the endobariatric procedures, both ESG and bariatric provisions, which I\u2019ll come back to in a minute. For X-Tack, it\u2019s an important new addition to our portfolio. It creates \u2013 it fills an important clinical need between OverStitch that is used for full thickness, large defects typically in the upper GI and through the scope clips, which often are used for quite small defects. X-Tack can be used in the upper and lower GI and has a good clinical and value proposition, especially in cases where you might need more than 3 or 4 through the scope clips. We are in the process of targeting high-volume accounts here in the U.S. and building utilization, building experience with the product and are pleased with the progress we\u2019re making. And I just emphasize we\u2019re still in quite early days of account penetration of experience with the product and with just the first clinical data being published today. So, lots of room and opportunity to continue to grow. Moving to the endobariatric side of things, it\u2019s a really, really significant and large opportunity. Obesity is clearly an epidemic that is continuing virtually unabated. You can see some numbers of 650 million people globally who suffer from obesity, in the U.S., 42% of adults. That translates to more than 100 million adults in the U.S., have a BMI over 30. And yet despite that, there are only about 200,000 primary surgical procedures currently in the U.S. In addition to primary procedures, revisions of prior surgeries, is a very meaningful opportunity for us. It\u2019s the fastest growing segment of the bariatric surgery market, increasing almost 5x in the last decade. And we believe to be a potentially $1 billion opportunity based off of the volume of procedures that have taken place. Building on that, to be clear, what we\u2019re talking about are patients who have previously undergone the two leading procedures for bariatric surgeries. One is a gastric bypass procedure and the other is a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The data showed that there were 1.4 million of those procedures in the last decade. And there is a lot of clinical evidence that suggests that at least a third to a half of patients will, in fact, regain weight often and within about a 5-year period. And there were 43,000 revision procedures, surgical revision procedures that were already done in 2019. But we believe that there is potentially an important role for OverStitch in endoscopic revisions. And in fact, 70% of our top 100 accounts in the U.S. are already performing at least some of these procedures. And the reason why or at least some evidence for it is on the right-hand side. This is from a study that was published over the summer. It was conducted at Brigham in Women\u2019s Hospital, and it\u2019s a 5-year study that compares endoscopic revisions to surgical revisions of gastric bypass patients. And what you see in the data are essentially equivalent weight loss were very close to it and then \u2013 but a much better safety profile, a lower rate of adverse events and especially serious adverse events. So we\u2019re encouraged by that. And it\u2019s one of the main reasons why, in addition to submitting for ESG for de novo into cushion, we also submitted for revisions as well. For the ESG procedure, again, endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty, it has performed completely using the OverStitch device. And interestingly, it\u2019s been in development for a number of years now. And there are over 200 publications or abstracts that have already been developed more than 6,500 patients in addition to the MERIT study that I referenced earlier. And consistently, those results have shown a procedure that has a very good efficacy profile. The data on the right side of the page show a pooled analysis of eight studies and nearly 2,000 patients that showed very promising both excess body weight loss and total body weight loss. There is another part of the same pooled analysis showed an SAE rate of 2%, which is exactly what we saw in the MERIT study. And then there are other inherent benefits to the ESG procedure as well. It can be reversible if need be. It\u2019s anatomy sparing because we\u2019re not taking out any tissue. There is no scarring. It can be done as an outpatient procedure, and there is a relatively quick return to work. So there are a number of potential benefits. And one of the reasons why we are already seeing some practitioners embrace the procedure, but we are also very conscious of not marketing explicitly for it. And so we are going to work through the approval processes with the FDA and look forward to the potential of a new indication. We would estimate in a period on average de novo 510(k) take about 12 months. And so we will be flatting around that kind of a time line for a new launch. So hopefully, that gives you an update on the quarter-to-date from an overall business standpoint and a vision for where we\u2019re going forward. But to dive more into the financials, let me turn it to Jeff. Jeff Black : Thank you, Chad and good afternoon everybody. I\u2019d spend a couple of minutes here just reviewing the financials review for today and then give some brief commentary on our operating spend profile and cash profile. So, starting with revenue, we ended the quarter with strong growth across all product \u2013 all of our products, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. As Chad mentioned, we saw a nice balance in that growth. In the U.S., we saw a 66% growth outside the U.S., 55%. Our endoscopic suturing was up 30%, and that\u2019s just highlighting continued demand for our products, OverStitch and X-Tack across a number of patient indications. Orbera grew more than 20%, and that was against what we would consider a stronger-than-expected rebound in elective procedures a year ago in Q3 2020. On a year-to-date basis, suturing and balloon product lines both grew 63% over 2022. In terms of the full year outlook, we expect $63 million to $64 million in revenue for 2021. And this represents more than 50% growth over 2022, which we acknowledge was heavily impacted \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, over 2020, which we acknowledge was heavily impacted by COVID, but it also represents 40% growth in endobariatric revenue over 2019. Moving to gross margin, in the third quarter, we saw gross margin improve by 190 basis points over Q3 2020. We saw an improved 360 basis points on a year-to-date basis. We also saw gross margin improve sequentially over the second quarter by 150 basis points. As we continue to talk about, we remain very focused on continued gross margin improvements, particularly with OverStitch, which has a lower margin profile than Orbera and X-Tack. Major drivers of overall margin expansion will be product mix, improved absorption of overhead and direct COGS improvement programs, particularly focused on OverStitch. We\u2019re still very early innings, but we\u2019re beginning to see the impact from all of these factors. And we remain confident that we will see a blended gross margin in the mid-60s over the next 3 to 5 years. Moving on to the operating expenses, we look at our operating expense spend profile, and we think it\u2019s important to exclude non-cash stock-based compensation to get a clearer picture of what our non-GAAP core operating expense run rate looks like. And today, our non-GAAP OpEx is running at about 72% of revenue, of which 36% is sales and marketing, and that\u2019s a combination of variable and fixed compensation and investments in overall channel development, much like we\u2019ve been talking about. We do plan to invest for top line growth over the midterm and focus areas there will be sales channel expansion, marketing, medical education, clinical reimbursement, product development and COGS improvement programs. So we do expect to see operating expenses, increase in both absolute dollars and percentage of sales, particularly in 2022, and we should start to see some operating expense leverage in \u201823 and beyond. But I think importantly, we have the ability to modulate spend as we need to, and we\u2019re well positioned from a balance sheet perspective to make these investments. And that brings me to Slide 21 on cash usage. You\u2019ll see that over the first 9 months of this year, our average gross \u2013 our gross quarterly cash burn was $3.7 million, net burn was under $3 million. We ended the quarter with pro forma cash of $98 million. That includes the net proceeds from the $75 million follow-on we executed a few weeks ago. So we\u2019re now very well positioned to execute on our growth initiatives. But not only do this financing provide us with substantial cash runway, it added a number of very high-quality fundamental healthcare investors to a solid and growing shareholder base. And so we thank our investors both existing and new for the continued support and confidence. And then finally, before I turn it back to Chad, just a few comments on Slide 22 here regarding our cap table, we think it\u2019s important to paint a complete picture here, given that there are a couple of elements that don\u2019t show up in our issued and outstanding share count. So today, we have just under 40 million in issued and outstanding common shares. In addition, there are just under 14 million shares in prepaid funded warrants. So this would equate to 54 million shares in outstanding common and common equivalents. We also have about 6.3 million shares underlying our $19 million in convertible debt. So all in, as we think about our cap table is we represent just over 60 million common shares outstanding on a pro forma fully diluted basis. And we think it\u2019s important to provide this clarity on the call, just given the recent raise and historical funding mechanics for Apollo. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Chad. Charles McKhann : Thanks, Jeff. And let me echo Jeff\u2019s comments of thank you to our investors, both existing who\u2019s been with the company for a long time as well as those who joined us in the recent fund raise. We very much appreciate it. So looking forward and kind of wrapping up, we absolutely view a number of very significant catalysts across each of our product lines in the coming months and years. And I\u2019ve touched on these already, but with OverStitch the submission for the 510(k) is a big step for us, looking for a potential approval, right? We still need to work through the process with the FDA, but if successful, a potential approval potentially in the next year, which could form the basis of developing endoscopic rate loss practices and procedures and then also the basis of expanding reimbursement over time. With X-Tack, good progress with the U.S. launch, our first clinical evidence published and just recently here, and we announced it today. We are aware of others that are also in development and so more studies that will be coming out about the product in coming meetings over the course of the next year. And as I mentioned, looking towards a broader launch outside the U.S. potentially in 2022 as well and we also have our engineers working with the early clinicians who use X-Tack on R&D initiatives and what we\u2019re calling product line extensions for X-Tack. There is some great ideas there and hold the future potential of new developments of using X-Tack essentially as a platform for new developments. And we will have more updates as we move forward with that. And then they have balloon, which has been doing very well globally. In the coming year, we would expect to start a trial for NASH and the new indication. As we\u2019ve announced previously, there are new CPT codes that will be implemented starting in January 1, 2023. And then we also see the balloon as a critical component of an integrated practice for endoscopic weight loss as a key driver for the product line globally. And so to finish with our overall growth outlook, we\u2019re very pleased with the growth we\u2019ve seen this year, essentially 50% growth over 2020 as you look at the guidance of $63 million to $64 million. And all of that underlying this energized phase. So top line growth, really building the team and energizing the organization as well as our customers, continuing to grow the commercial organizations globally, both within the U.S. and outside the U.S., enhancing our position in that advanced GI category, overstated product and then adding X-Tack to it, developing the next new things from an R&D standpoint and then very importantly, fortifying our balance sheet. And all of that creates the foundation, we believe, for the next phase of acceleration and then ultimately, leadership. And so with that, we thank you for your interest. Thank you for joining the call, and we will open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Frank Takkinen from Lake Street Capital Markets. Your line is live. Frank Takkinen : Thanks for taking my questions guys and congrats on the great results. Want to start with X-Tack, curious if you could tease out just how much revenue was generated from X-Tack in the third quarter? And then as a follow-up to that, can we just take a step back and we\u2019ve spoken about market sizes a couple of times as far as total account opportunity. How large the clip market is and those types of things? But I wanted to take a step back and just now that you\u2019ve had a couple of quarters under your belt, if you could frame up how large of a product line you feel like X-Tack can be for Apollo? Charles McKhann : Yes. So thanks, Frank. Appreciate your comments. So for competitive reasons, we\u2019re still not separating X-Tack out individually. It\u2019s continued to do well. As you know, in the first half of the year on our Q2 call, we mentioned that we passed the $1 million mark, which was an important milestone for us. And we\u2019ve been able to continue to grow from there. We see X-Tack as an important contributor to growth, especially as it becomes a global product line for us. It\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re pleased with the utilization across both upper and lower GI. There are a lot of potential cases, inclusive of a big opportunity that we\u2019ve talked about colonoscopies. 20 million colonoscopies that are performed each year, a significant portion of those that do require \u2013 should be closed, right? There is a lot of clinical data that they should be closed. Otherwise, there is a risk of delayed bleeding. That\u2019s at least 8% to 10% based off of a number of studies. And that aspect predates X-Tack, right, that the pivotal study that studied that was actually sponsored by some of the equipment manufacturers but it\u2019s growing. I just recently at the ACG meeting, and there was a discussion of the need to close. And we think X-Tack is very much well positioned for that market, among others. So we see it being an important growth driver for us as well as along with OverStitch as well as the balloon. And so it can play a very important role going forward. Frank Takkinen : Got it. Okay. And then I just wanted to maybe back up to a little bit broader question. I think I saw in your slides a 20% plus midterm target revenue CAGR on a go-forward basis. Am I understanding this correctly that you\u2019re thinking on a regular basis, you can be growing top line about 20% as a whole? Charles McKhann : Yes. I mean that\u2019s a \u2013 we went through a strategic planning process over the summer as a team and really looked at our opportunities across product lines and across markets. And so that is, in our view, sort of a medium to longer term target that we\u2019re aiming for and that we believe that we can potentially achieve. It\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re not guiding to next year yet. But it is what we are kind of aiming for from an overall \u2013 we want to be a consistent growth company, and we believe that that\u2019s at the right level that we can achieve. Frank Takkinen : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then the last one for me, I just wanted to touch on the revision market a little bit more, specifically as it relates to reimbursement, I know there is some things working, you\u2019re working through as it relates to ESG reimbursement. But my sense is there is some reimbursement that\u2019s in place and it\u2019s a little bit easier for the reimbursement in place to be revisions with OverStitch product. One, am I understanding this correctly? And two, can you maybe just give us a little background around reimbursement as it specifically relates to revisions? Charles McKhann : Yes. So revisions are interesting in that you\u2019re right, because the patients have had a prior procedure and have experienced the benefits of weight loss. When they have like regain, they often also have a lot of additional comorbidities as well. And the alternative is a surgical procedure, right, and which is often an inpatient procedure. So what we find or at least as I talk to many of our customers, is that they are able to pursue case-by-case prior authorizations for revision procedures. They are using typically an unlisted code. There is no dedicated code for revisions. But what we hear quite frequently is a lot of success in being able to make the case that an endoscope revision is the right way to go and be able to get those procedures reimbursed. And so we think that\u2019s a good foundation to build on. That\u2019s our customers are pursuing that individually. Again, we don\u2019t have the indication. So we are not actively supporting that. We\u2019re learning from our customers, and we\u2019re thinking about the team we might want to have in place if we are, in fact, successful with an indication to help support other customers and having similar success. Frank Takkinen : Got it. Perfect. Thanks. I will stop there. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Chris Cooley from Stephens. Your line is live. Chris Cooley : Good afternoon and congratulations on the stellar quarter. Maybe just two quick operational questions for me, could you help us think a little bit just when we look at the growth in the U.S. and internationally, I guess, two components there. One, do you attribute the decline in the IGB franchise outside the United States to \u2013 is this more COVID-related? Do you think these were competitive concerns during the quarterly period? Just would appreciate some color there and then how we might extrapolate that to the United States now that the stats balloon is approved here as well. And then similarly, though, if I could just think about the U.S. growth, which was really strong in the ESS franchise up about 130%, I\u2019m looking at this correctly. Could you maybe just help us think a little bit about the contribution there from X-Tack? I know you\u2019re not willing to give the dollar revenue piece out. In the past, you\u2019ve talked about a number of accounts. I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s a statistic you\u2019d still be willing to help us with? And then I have got one quick follow-up. Charles McKhann : Sure. Chris, let me make sure I\u2019m clear on your question on IGB when you talked about the decline. What \u2013 I just want to make sure I\u2019m addressing the line question. Chris Cooley : I picked up the wrong number. It\u2019s only \u2013 it\u2019s actually up there. I\u2019m looking at the queue here quickly. I apologize. So if you could just maybe speak more to the U.S. growth? Charles McKhann : Sure. Yes. So, just wanted to make sure I was clear in answering the right question. Actually, on the IGB, we are very pleased with the growth. Important to recall last year, was actually kind of a rebound quarter at least in the U.S. for gastric balloons. And so seeing growth on top of that, we were very pleased with. On the U.S. growth for endoscopic suturing, again, the growth, I think has been nicely balanced, both core growth with OverStitch, if we look \u2013 especially, if we look year-on-year, pretty comparable quarter-on-quarter. And that\u2019s not surprising as you think about summer months and as well as \u2013 and we have talked about previously the navigating through COVID and OverStitch depending on the setting of care can be impacted as a lot of procedures still are, and we are all still navigating that. But we did see with X-Tack a growth in the number of accounts utilizing in the quarter of kind of a double-digit growth in that. Our strategy is much more focused on utilization than just growing accounts. So, we do continue to see growth in accounts, but we are actually, frankly, incentivizing our team and focusing our team on growth within the targeted accounts that we are already in while continuing to add the account base. Chris Cooley : That\u2019s helpful. And if I could just as well quickly and I will get back in queue, just looking through here as well, see that distributor sales increased pretty significantly as a percentage of revenue versus the prior year. But when I look at least at first pass here in terms of kind of the standard metrics like DSO and the like cash conversion cycle. It doesn\u2019t seem like that impacted things if, in fact, you improved on those ratios. So one, I was hoping you could just expand on maybe the increase in distributor efforts outside of the U.S. And two, if you are doing anything different there such that just when we look at those kind of metrics, we are not seeing any kind of expansion in the short run with that kind of step up in distributor sales? Thanks so much. Charles McKhann : Sure. I will hit the sales side of it, and then Jeff can elaborate. Distributor sales can be somewhat lumpy, sometimes, right. They can be large orders. And then I would say the historical comparison is important in that. The U.S. did recover faster last year than the distributor markets. And so it is important to kind of take a longer term view of kind of quarter-to-quarter. But we feel good about where we are in terms of with the distributor orders and then solid orders across geographies. So, there wasn\u2019t one big order that affected the results here. It was pretty balanced again across our different distributor markets. My lumpy comment was really just sort of a reference to the comparison for last year where the distributor market was much slower to come back. And so that comparison is probably important as to year-on-year. Jeff, as you look about the other metrics? Jeff Black : Yes, Chris, on DSOs, I can tell you that I am almost 90 days in now, I guess, 90 days in today. I have actually been really \u2013 was that \u2013 thank you, I have been really impressed with the company\u2019s ability to collect. And I think it\u2019s a function, both OUS and in the U.S. of the team really knowing the customer, particularly in OUS distribution. Mike and his team has just done a phenomenal job at building a customer base or whether you call them a direct distributor or otherwise and really understand their customer. And so we have been really pleased. We have not had collection issues to-date. And as we bring on new distributors, they are very well vetted. And so I think we continue to really push on collections and we have had a lot of success there. Chris Cooley : Super. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Matt Hewitt from Craig-Hallum Capital. Your line is live. Matt Hewitt : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe first one and I realize it\u2019s only been a week, but I am just curious what the initial feedback or interest or inbound calls that you receive from following the final release of the MERIT data. This is something that I know the investment committee has been waiting for several years, but so has I would think, the practitioners, the people that are doing these procedures on a daily basis have likely been waiting too. So, I am just curious what you have heard in the past week. Charles McKhann : Thanks, Matt. Yes, there has been a lot of excitement. It was fun to be at the ACG meeting, which was immediately after that, if so, a virtual meeting and so to talk to a lot of customers there. It was as you follow the space and know the data were very much confirmatory to a lot of data that have already been collected, but it\u2019s still really nice to see, right, in terms of randomized control data that supports the value proposition. And so we have had good conversations with leaders from both the GI and the surgical side of things. People are obviously looking forward to the indication as well because that will certainly also play a role in things like reimbursement and other activities. But the general feedback is a lot of excitement and very positive. Matt Hewitt : That\u2019s great. Thank you. And then on the \u2013 we really appreciate the slide kind of going through what\u2019s next, the near-term and kind of mid-term catalysts. But one that I didn\u2019t see on there, how should we be thinking about CPT codes for OverStitch? Do you need to get the labels in place first, or is it possible that in the January meeting, you could see even if it\u2019s just more of a generic label CPT code, what\u2019s the cadence there? Charles McKhann : Yes. No. So, the CPT process really is led by the societies. And so the GI societies are very aware of and are thinking about CPT codes, both around revisions and primary ESGs. And so they are actively working on that. We are just getting into the new cycle that would be for the next three meetings that take place over the next year would point towards a CPT code being in effect January 1, 2024. That\u2019s just the way those cycles work. And so they know those deadlines and are thinking about it. It\u2019s a combination of primarily making sure all the ducks are aligned with the actual publication and then the submission process. In fact, we are working together across other societies to ensure there is support. And so that activity is ongoing. We are optimistic that it happen within one of these next three meetings to be in that January 2024 cycle. But there is more work to do. And ultimately, the societies are going to drive that timeline. We will do our best to make sure they have got the information they need to be able to do that. Matt Hewitt : Got it. Yes. Just like you had with ORBERA where the societies were kind of led that charge to, I understand that. And then maybe last one for me and then I will hop back in. Regarding the ORBERA NASH study, has there been any update as far as the specifics on the trial? Where do those stand, because I think it starts early next year, but if you could provide an update on that, it would be appreciated? Thank you. Charles McKhann : Yes. Matt, previously, we had communicated start potentially at the beginning of next year. We are still in the design phase, quite frankly, of that as we work through both with the FDA and with CMS and working it through. We have also with the information around the comorbidity effects with ESG are also having some interesting discussions as exclusively an ORBERA balloon trial. Is it potentially an ORBERA balloon as well as an ESG trial, maybe a multi-arm trial. So, we want to make sure that whatever study we design and get approved by the agencies does lead us to a pathway towards positive reimbursement. So, we are taking the time with our advisers to make sure we get that right. And so we won\u2019t be starting a study early next year, but we are working on the design of that that would still allow us to move forward from there. Matt Hewitt : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Adam Maeder from Piper Sandler. Your line is live. Adam Maeder : Hi Charles. Hi Jeff. Congrats on all the success here and I appreciate you guys taking the questions. Two for me, one near-term and then one on the mid to longer term. So first and foremost, just on the guidance, revenue guide, you took that up to $63 million to $64 million. I think that implies $16.8 million or so at the midpoint for Q4. Clearly, some good underlying momentum in the business exiting Q3 and by my math, that\u2019s about 4% quarter-over-quarter sequential growth. So, it seems pretty reasonable and I guess prudent, given the environment, but I wanted to dig in a little bit just on the construction of the guidance. So, maybe what\u2019s embedded in the guide for various things like COVID-19, potential staffing issues or other capacity constraints. And then we have heard some other medtech companies talk about a backlog accumulating during Q3. So, just wondering if you have a backlog that needs to be worked through as well? And then I have a follow-up. Jeff Black : Yes. Adam, this is Jeff. I appreciate the question. Look, I think as we have talked about Q3 was \u2013 there was definitely COVID impact. And we are maybe less exposed to it than others that are more dependent upon inpatient hospital procedures. We do have a fair amount of our business is outpatient and even in surgery centers. So, I think we are probably less impacted, but we certainly saw the impact. And it\u2019s lumpy. And to the extent that we see concentrations of impact in geographies where we have greater amounts of business and will certainly be impacted. But I think we have got the benefit of being an outpatient. We have got the benefit of having being geographically dispersed, not just within U.S. geography, but globally. But that said, we are still seeing some pressure and we expect to continue seeing pressure. So, we are being cautiously optimistic and feel good about the guidance we put set forth. I would like to say that there is a huge backlog. We would love the backlog. That\u2019s not been our experience. And we are pretty certain that the business that we are seeing represents run rate demand. And going into the fourth quarter, it would have been great to start with the backlog, but that\u2019s not the case for us. Adam Maeder : Okay. Very helpful, Jeff. Thank you for that. And then just for the second question, the MERIT data now in hand, results look really compelling. Just curious if I could push a little bit on the mid to longer term outlook for OverStitch. How are you guys thinking about growth going forward? You have grown that product very nicely, 20% to 25% range or even above that with the exception of last year, which is impacted by the pandemic. So, does the future ESG label potential broader reimbursement steep in that curve? Does it sustain the durability? Just how do we think about the dynamics there? And I will hop back in the queue. Thanks so much guys. Charles McKhann : Yes, Adam. The \u2013 so the three phases I laid out going back to originally sort of defining the strategy, we have never put an exact timeline against those. But in my mind, the critical trigger of moving from that energized to the accelerate phase is the indication for ESG and for revisions, right. And so I do see them as a potential accelerator even while we are working on the broader reimbursement pathways that we just discussed. But even in that sort of medium-term of with an indication, being able to again, learn from physicians and institutions that have already started to connect the dots, we do think that there is a significant opportunity here. And so we are in that learning phase. We are going to be very careful and appropriate from a promotional standpoint. But if we are successful in getting the new indication, then absolutely, we see that as a potential of an accelerator from a growth standpoint for OverStitch. Adam Maeder : That\u2019s helpful, Charles. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Your line is live. Josh Jennings : Hi. Good evening and thanks for taking the questions. It\u2019s great to see the positive MERIT results and the strong quarterly results. I wanted to ask about the MERIT study and just what you saw with the durability of the outcome for ESG and just thinking about the body that is crude in front of Marriott, what do you think or what does your team think that durability will wind up? I mean this seems like 2-year sustained weight loss was demonstrated effectively in the MERIT study, and I was just curious in terms of how we should be thinking about the durability of the procedure going forward. Charles McKhann : Thanks, Josh for the question. Yes, the MERIT study had a 2-year endpoint. And you are right. As you saw in the data that we summarized today, there really was a nice durability and maintenance of weight loss out to 2 years. And there have been a number of other studies that have demonstrated that as well, including the pool analysis that\u2019s in the slide set. That does show nice consistent results out of that time period. There is also one study on ESG out to 5 years that was published just a few years ago. That has also showed a really nice maintenance of effect out to 5 years. And so we will encourage our investigators to keep collecting longer term data, because durability will certainly be an open question, especially for payers, for example. But we are pleased with what we are seeing. And so we think it \u2013 I think the investigators presenting the MERIT study talked about ESG potentially filling a really nice important gap between whether it\u2019s the bloom that typically has a shorter term time horizon as well as medications, right. There are some really interesting new medications, but compliance and costs have often been an issue for medications between those and then the surgeries, which do have some very good durability data for both laparoscopic sleeve and gastric bypasses. We think ESG can fill an important gap or very good durability and then an overall really good value proposition. And so we were pleased with the outcomes. Josh Jennings : Excellent. Just one quick follow-up on the \u2013 I understand the societies will be submitting for CPT code issuances. But thinking about payer decisions on coverage and payments, is there anything that Apollo can do while the FDA is reviewing the de novo application to just get this data in front of payers and start that process or do you need to have approval first before those discussions start? Thanks for taking the questions. Charles McKhann : Yes. No, we are going to tread pretty carefully there just because we don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves from a \u2013 but we can absolutely get all of our ducks in line, right. Now, with the benefit of the multiple studies I referenced and then the MERIT study on top of that, things like putting together all the economic value dossiers that you would need, continuing to encourage our investigators to publish on their results with comorbidities, for example, really reinforcing the different aspects of the value proposition. So, we have got a really good story to tell. So, I think it\u2019s a matter of, again, sort of planning and preparation now, making sure we have got the right team in place to do that, and we have been working on filling out that group. But the actual activities will depend on, first, the publication, but importantly, the indication as well. Josh Jennings : Great. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions in the queue. Charles McKhann : Listen, thank you all very much for joining us this evening. We very much appreciate your support and have a good evening. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s event. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode, and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Matt Kreps. Sir, the floor is yours. Matt Kreps : Thank you, John. And thanks everyone for participating in today's call to discuss Apollo 's fourth quarter and full-year 2021 financial and operating results. Joining me on the call today are Charles McKhann, Chief Executive Officer and Jeff Black, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will include slides to accompany the audio presentation. For those joining us by telephone, you can download a copy of the slides at our investor relations site, ir.apolloendo.com and choosing Events and Presentations. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including Apollo's financial outlook and Apollo's plans and timing for product development and sales. In addition, there is uncertainty about the continued spread of COVID-19 virus and the ongoing impact it may have on our operations, the demand for our products, global supply chains, and economic activity in general. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties, and Apollo 's actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent Form 10-Q. The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, February 22, 2022.  As required, except as required by law, Apollo undertakes no obligation to revise or update any statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. Additionally, today's discussion will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide an additional tool for evaluating the company's core performance. Management uses these metrics in its own evaluation of continuing operating performance, and a baseline for assessing the future earnings potential of the company. Included in our press release issued today our financial results and corresponding 8-K filing, our supplemental tables reconciling non-GAAP figures to their closest GAAP comparable. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Charles. Charles McKhann : Thanks, Matt. And thank everyone, good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. Next week will mark one year since I joined Apollo Endosurgery. And I am truly grateful for having the honor of leading this team and this company with such unique products that impact patients' lives. Last year, I laid out a three-phase strategy as described on page 3. The first phase was to energize the business by building momentum across all three of our product lines while executing on foundational initiatives that can set us up for growth in the years ahead.  The second phase is to accelerate the business by developing new indications in markets. And the third phase is to lead in the fields of advanced defect closure and as endoscopic treatments for weight loss. As we implement this strategy, we have bolstered the Apollo leadership team by bringing in new talent into the organization to join an already strong Apollo team. And in addition, we are focusing our efforts on developing large market opportunities. I'm pleased to report today that in the past 12 months and in Q4 that we've made tremendous progress, which strengthened the team at Apollo at all levels. At the leadership team earlier in the year, we brought on new commercial leaders here in the U.S., we brought in Jeff Black as our new CFO who's with me today. And then just in January, we announced the addition of Keely Scamperle to lead our reimbursement and market access efforts. Keely is an experienced professional and is already working at building her team that will lead our reimbursement efforts in facilitating patient access for our products.  We've nearly doubled our sales team in the U.S. and we've added to our OUS team. We're building our marketing and trading capabilities and becoming a more professional selling organization. We strengthened our R&D and engineering team and are implementing new processes to strengthening our new product pipeline. And we are addressing a historical underinvestment in other critical functions like operations, supply chain, business analytics, and customer service. Simply put, we have very talented people at Apollo and I'm very proud of the work that they've done. We've just not had a scalable organization.  And so we're strengthening our capabilities across the organization to support our growth plans. We're also building and developing a new culture, focusing on a set of five core values that I'll come back to later in the discussion. And so in summary, at Apollo, we're undergoing substantial change in our team, our processes, and our culture. And we anticipate that these changes will allow the company that has historically struggled at times and underperformed to become a growth engine. Now, often when a company undergoes this much change, the business often needs to take a step backwards before moving ahead with renewed confidence. And I'm very pleased that that is not the case for Apollo in 2021. For the year, we delivered 50% revenue growth, and for Q4, we delivered 26% growth. Despite a meaningful impact of the omicron variant in many markets in Western Europe and the U.S.., our growth has been balanced across product lines with OverStitch, ORBERA, and our newest product, X-Tack, all contributing to growth. And we've seen balanced growth across geographies with strong performance in both the U.S. and international markets. And while we kick-started the business in 2021, we've also created a foundation for the years ahead. In our advanced GI franchise, X-Tack is an important new product for us.  We gained initial traction in the marketplace and published the first clinical data for the product. In our endoscopic weight loss franchise, obesity is a global epidemic that remains largely unchecked and the opportunity for endoscopic weight loss therapies is tremendous. 2021 was a year of important strategic milestones. Early in the year, in the spring of last year, the AGA implemented new clinical practice guidelines for the first time ever in favor of intragastric balloons therapies. The MERIT investigators presented the initial results at the IPSO meeting in the fall.  We submitted a new De Novo application, De Novo 510(k) application for Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE. And through the course of the year, we saw an emergence of new endobariatric programs in both academic and private practice settings. In the area of NASH, we received a breakthrough designation for ORBERA for the treatment of NASH in Q1 of last year. We've also been collecting data on ESG, and working through the best strategy to address this large market opportunity. And then on our balance sheet. In 2021, we secured access to a $175 million in capital. We now have a strong balance sheet to support our growth initiatives. And so Page 5 gives you a sense of the balance that I just mentioned. On the left side of the page, you can see 50% year-on-year revenue growth, 55% for the ESS franchise. And importantly, 50% for the IGB franchise. And the figures relative to 2019 are shown as well. Another interesting development has been the growth in our top 10 accounts. We saw 85% year-on-year growth in our top 10 accounts. And the average sales for Apollo in those 10 accounts is more than $600,000. And we think that gives a pretty good indication of the scale that we can drive as we increase penetration into -- of our products into our largest customers. For X-Tack, we continue to gain traction and we saw 40% sequential quarter-on-quarter growth for X-Tack. And as I mentioned, we're already hit -- we had important milestones for both the MERIT study and the De Novo 510(k). Related to MERIT and clinical data for ESG and revisions, we do expect a conditional presentations of the data at the upcoming DDW meeting. That's the Digestive Disease Week meeting that's in May. We also expect other publications on -- I'm sorry, presentations at that meeting on ESG and revisions from investigators around the world, sort of important additions to the clinical body of evidence. For MERIT itself, the investigators are working on the publication and we look forward to that in the months ahead. Jeff will now provide a review of our financial performance, and I will be back to provide additional commentary on our priorities for the year ahead. Jeff Black : Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon, everybody. Thank you all for joining us today. I'll spend a few minutes to recap our financial results and then to hand it back to Charles to discuss our 2022 outlook and strategy. Starting with revenue on Slide 7. In Q4, we continued to see strong year-over-year growth across the product portfolio, and our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. And that was against the backdrop of pandemic-related pressure. As we all know, this has been a changing dynamic throughout 2021, and we did see pressure on Q4 volumes.  Outside the U.S., we saw pressure earlier in the quarter in concentrated markets, particularly Western Europe. And inside the U.S., we began to see slowdowns later in the quarter, particularly December, predominantly in academic hospitals and larger community hospitals where access was more limited. Even with this pressure on procedure volumes, we still maintained a healthy monthly revenue cadence in December, consistent with the rest of the quarter where we didn't see was the ramp that we expected in the last half of December. And that was really difference between hitting the low end of our annual revenue guidance and the high end or better. Growth in the fourth quarter was balanced between U.S., where we saw 25% growth, and international, which grew 27%. Globally, our endoscopic suturing business was up over 37% in the fourth quarter and that's just highlights continued demand for our OverStitch and X-Tack products across a broad range of indications. Globally, ORBERA revenue was up 20% and that was below our blended growth rate, really due to volume pressure in the U.S., where growth was about 6%. But we believe this down tick is transitory and that it was mostly attributed to inpatient in hospital settings in the U.S. where access was limited in Q4. For the full year, we saw revenue growth of 50% and a gained balanced across our U.S. or international businesses and across product lines. Overall, we're pleased with our revenue performance in 2021 and our ability to navigate a challenging fourth quarter for Medtech broadly. Turning to gross margin on Slide 8. In the fourth quarter, we saw gross margin improved by 40 basis points in -- versus fourth quarter of 2022, 260 basis points on a year-to-date basis. We continue to remain focused on gross margin improvements, particularly with OverStitch, which as we've discussed, had a lower margin profile than ORBERA and X-Tack. Major drivers of overall gross margin expansion will be product mix, improved overhead absorption, and direct cogs improvement programs, again, focused primarily on OverStitch.  During 2022, we should start to see the impact of some of the cost improvement initiatives that we completed in 2021. And at the same time, we're navigating supply chain and manufacturing scale-up complexities, but we remain confident in our ability to drive blended gross margin to the mid 60% range over the next three to five years. Moving to Slide 10 -- so moving to Slide 9. As we look at operating spend profile, we think it's important to exclude non-cash stock-based compensation to get a clearer picture of what our real non-core GAAP operating expense run rate is.  In the near-term, we're focused on building capabilities following historical underinvestment in the business. For example, you'll see in the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP OpEx ran at about 79% of revenue, that reflects our planned investments in growth initiatives, primarily to build out our U.S. sales channel and our marketing programs as we prepare for the anticipated launch of our ESG products. In the U.S., we have a small commercial team relative to the size of our opportunities, but we made great progress throughout 2021 to expand that footprint.  We started the year with 16 direct reps in the U.S. We ended with about 30 by the end of the fourth quarter. And going forward, we'll continue to evaluate the appropriate scale of our commercial team and invest as necessary. Our other focused areas of planned investment will be medical education, clinical reimbursement, product development, and continued COGS improvement initiatives. We do expect to see operating expenses increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue, particularly in 2022 and we should start to see operating expense leverage in 2023 and beyond. But I think importantly, we have the ability to modulate spend as appropriate. And we're now well positioned from a balance sheet perspective to make these investments. Moving to Slide 10, you'll see that during 2021, our average quarterly burn was about $4 million a quarter. We ended the year with cash of about $92 million. Until now, Apollo has not been capitalized to adequately fund our long-term plan. The company historically did a very nice job managing burn, particularly during a very challenging global pandemic. However, due to historical under-investment, the company really has not been well positioned to support even modest growth. That changed for us in the fourth quarter as we secured over $125 million in new capital and borrowing capacity, which enables us to begin making the investments required to capitalize on the opportunities we see ahead of us, and this -- we can do this without creating a concern about cash runway. We're now extremely well positioned to execute on our plan growth initiatives. Turning to Slide 11. And before I turn things back over to Charles, just a few comments on our new credit facility with Innovatus Capital Partners, which we executed in December of last year. Key terms of -- or key strategic reasons for the new term loan is a reduction in our cost of capital, an extension of our amortization by an additional 33 months over our prior-term loan, and a decrease in debt service costs by nearly $30 million over the next three years, we also have now additional borrowing capacity that provides [Indiscernible] and delusive growth capital, and strategic flexibility.  At close, we drew $35 million to repay our prior-term debt, and we now have up to $65 million available for future tranches, $15 million will be available in 2023 and $25 million available in 2024, both based on achievement of revenue milestones. And another up to $25 million available for approved strategic acquisitions is such opportunities to rise. Borrowings mature in December of 2027, interest-only payments run through January of 2027. This was a great result for us. We couldn't be happier with the outcome of this and we look forward to our new partnership with Innovatus. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Charles. Charles McKhann : Okay. Now as we look ahead to the year of 2022, let me talk about our overall strategy and our outlook for the year ahead. Page 13 gives you a summary of our three product lines and the two main businesses in which we operate : an advanced GI and endoscopic weight loss. And we are excited that we have very attractive growth opportunities across both sides of our business. As I mentioned previously, we also are focused on going after large market opportunities in advanced GI, in weight loss, and then over time in NASH as well.  So for the year ahead, our outlook from a revenue standpoint is $73 million to $75 million, which translates to 16% to 19% growth compared to 202. And let me also share a few words as it relates to the COVID impact. In Q4 and early Q1 of this year, we have seen an impact in markets globally. As others have reported lower procedure volumes, staffing issues, reduced hospital access, have all presented challenges, especially in larger academic medical centers and community hospital. That said, more recently, the omicron case counts are coming down, the situation appears to be improving. And so we are optimistic that the impact of this wave is beginning to abate. And so as we look ahead for 2022, we see four key catalysts to drive our growth in the year ahead. X-Tack expansion and ORBERA resurgence, preparing for the Apollo ESG and Apollo Revise launches, and continuing to advance our organization. The first with X-Tack, and I'm on Slide 16. The X-Tack has been a very important product for us as it adds to our portfolio in the advanced GI side of our business, and it offers a truly differentiated product in defect closure. And with X-Tack, we're still in the early days of the adoption of the new product and procedure, and we feel that we've got a lot of room to continue to grow. For example, currently more than 60% of our X-Tack sales are in upper GI. There are many reasons for this. Our OverStitch device, which is the core device for the company, is used primarily in the upper GI. And so many of our existing customers primarily due upper GI procedures and are familiar with suturing techniques. Furthermore, for most of 2021, we had a very small sales team in the U.S., and it's not surprising that they had more success with our existing customers initially in applications in the upper GI. That said, we continue to see very positive feedback from customers about the role of X-Tack following pulp removal and lower GI cases such as the colon and the duodenum. And procedure volumes suggests that ultimately these applications have potential to do much and much larger market opportunity.  And so in 2022, we anticipated that we can continue to expand usage in both upper and lower GI, approach and train new users, and increase adoption of X-Tack. Importantly, 2022 will also be a year where we add additional clinical data for X-Tack.  To date, the data is strong but it's very limited. We anticipate additional studies on the use of X-Tack, including at the same up DDW meeting that I mentioned in areas like the colon [Indiscernible] and stent fixation and other potential applications for the product. In addition, we are ramping up our efforts in peer-to-peer education for X-Tack. The best way for physicians to learn about a new products or procedure is from their colleagues. And we've done some peer-to-peer education to date, but we are ramping up these efforts as part of our strategy in 2022. And we also have a significant growth opportunity for X-Tack outside the U.S. We've gained initial success in a handful of markets outside the U.S., and we are actively working towards a CE mark, which we expect in the second half of this year. And for feedback from physicians, for example, in Western Europe, they are very excited about the clinical and economic value proposition for X-Tack in their practice. Turning to Slide 17 in ORBERA. ORBERA as a meaningful part of the Apollo portfolio and offers compelling clinical benefits for patients. And 2021 was a very strong year for ORBERA. It accounts for more than a third of our total revenue and grew by more than 50%. And there are a number reasons for this resurgence and many of these we view as sustainable trends.  First, as it relates to COVID, we have seen a trend towards more procedures taking place in outpatient facilities and offices, which is the primary location for ORBERA. I mentioned earlier the AGA practice guidelines. And again, those talked about the clinical benefits of intragastric balloons in general, but especially the clinical benefits of a 10% total body weight loss on cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and liver function. So really adding to the clinical validation of the product. We've seen an uptick in physician interest and training on the balloon. And we are implementing new co-marketing programs. These are programs where we can work directly with practices that know how to treat patients with balloons and get excellent patient outcomes. And we can invest in these, we can track the performance, and then double-down on the programs that are most successful. Finally, we anticipate a continued opportunity for intragastric balloons to be a meaningful part of a broader endoscopic endobariatric practice, endoscopic weight loss practice. And I'll come back to that here in a minute. But a lot of good things happening to the intragastric balloon franchise. The next catalyst which we've talked about previously is the potential for a new indication for the Apollo ESG and the Apollo REVISE products. Now importantly, we don't currently have an indication for these weight loss applications, and we are very careful to only promote within our approve labeling. But we have submitted to FDA and we're working through that process, and we are very excited about the potential for a launch of Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE. and I use the word launch very intentionally here.  I want you to think about this like a new product launch. You hear about it in the pharmaceutical world, or you hear about from a large medical device manufacturer, in terms of our comprehensive, holistic approach to really maximize the opportunity for the product. Internally, we have a massive effort ongoing in areas across marketing and medical education, training, reimbursement and market access, and sales team readiness to prepare ourselves for the ultimate launch of these new products. Our team is very busy and they're very excited. And while we're busy preparing for the launches internally, there's an interesting dynamic in development taking place more broadly in the medical community. The growth of new endobariatric programs in academic settings. A few years ago, there were a handful of pioneering physicians and practices in this field. The centers that participated in the MERIT study were among the early adopters. The Mayo Clinic, UT Houston, Brigham and Women's, Cornell, and Johns Hopkins are all good examples, as well as some leading centers internationally that really have developed -- driven the development of this field. More recently, many new programs are emerging across the country in institutions such as the Cleveland Clinic, UCLA, USC, West Virginia, and USC and others. In recent months, I personally visited many of these centers that are highlighted on this page and it's very encouraging to hear about their plans to develop this emerging field of endoscopic weight loss. And this is just a U.S. snapshot. Similar phenomenon absolutely happening outside the U.S. in countries around the world as it'd become more familiar with the MERIT study and other data that's been collected for both primary ESG s and revision procedures, as well as for the intragastric balloon and the role of the ORBERA balloon with the new AGA practice guidelines. So it's [Indiscernible] development one that we'll keep an eye on.  So turning now to our organization, I mentioned right up front that we are retooling up all those people, processes, and culture to meet our aspirations. Our new commercial leadership team is creating a professional selling organization, new sales processes. We've hired a new director of sales training. We're improving our analytics and CRM capabilities. We've also recently brought on Cooley to lead the reimbursement and market access efforts and we're also and we are rallying organization around a new culture that centers on five core values : we are patient - centric, we're customer-focused, we are innovative, we are passionate, and we care.  We care about all of our stakeholders and we care about delivering operational excellence. And we are working to build an organization that can deliver sustainable growth in the years ahead. So before we move to the Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Dr. Bruce Robertson from HIG Capital for his tremendous service to Apollo Endosurgery and our Board of Directors for more than 14 years. Bruce participated in the very first institutional investment round for the company in 2008, and has served on our board since then.  He's been instrumental in guiding the company through its formative stages and getting us to the point where we are today. In addition, Bruce has been a fantastic colleague and advisor for me in my first year as CEO. Bruce has decided to step down due to other commitments, and we wish him well. We're conducting a board search process and look forward to providing updates soon. It's on closing. In 2021, we made excellent progress in energizing the business and building the foundation for future growth. I am -- I anticipate that over the course of 2022, we'll begin to transition from this initial energized phase of our strategy. We have multiple catalyst s for growth across our product lines and geographies, and we're putting in place the right team, the right processes, the right culture to meet our aspirations. Thank you for your time today and for your interest in Apollo. And we'll now open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. The first question is coming from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Your line is live. Eric Assaraf : Hi, this is Eric on for Josh. Thanks for taking the questions. I appreciate all the great commentary around the early experience with X-Tack. Just curious, as you get closer to European approval here, could you help us understand what would be included in your CE mark submission. And then is any of your U.S. regulatory work leverageable for attaining that CE mark. Thank you. Charles McKhann : Yeah, no. Thanks, Eric. Yes, under the new NDR requirements, there's obviously additional need for clinical data. So we have been able to leverage some of the data that was included in our initial clinical study that's been published, as well as a lot of the work that went into the U.S. application. As I'm sure, you know, in the past, having an FDA approval, it'd be almost a slam dunk, right? To quickly follow on in U.S. first. It really, right now, is just a timing element of as our notified body works through a backlog of applications from a lot of companies, but we think we've got the right materials that they need to get the approval. Eric Assaraf : Understood. That's great. Thank you. And then thinking about guidance for 2022, could you help us understand what COVID assumptions you're baking into the range here. Jeff, your comments around trends in December, especially in the U.S. How should we be thinking about Q1 revenues relative to the results that you've just delivered here in the fourth quarter? Just any commentary on the cadence of revenue through the year would be really helpful. Thank you. Jeff Black : Sure, Eric. And again, we haven't given quarterly guidance as you know, but I think it's consistent with what -- I think what you're hearing broadly in the industry is certainly early in the quarter, we saw pressured volumes, much like we saw in the fourth quarter. We're starting to see some of that abate. We're seeing nice momentum. But what we can say about the quarter is that we're certainly comfortable with where the street has us in terms of consensus for Q1. That in case, we start to think about the acceleration of the ramp to that 20% growth. That really happens once we get beyond the COVID impact and we start to see acceleration in some of these endobariatric practices. Eric Assaraf : That's great. Thank you guys. Operator : Okay. The next question is coming from Matthew Blackman from Stifel. Your line is live. Matthew Blackman : All right. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Just got a couple. Maybe Charles, just to start with you, I was hoping to get the priorities in 2022 for the U.S. commercial team, whether it's figuring out the sales force size, whether it's focusing on existing accounts or expanding the customer base. I just want to understand what the focus is in '22. And if you could layer on top of that the folks that you've onboarded over the course of 2021, how they are ramping, how productivity for the whole sales force looks like. And then just a couple of quick follow-ups. Charles McKhann : Sure. Matt, as I think, you know, we have our core reps and the vast majority of our sales team in the U.S. carry the full bag of all three products, and then we've now layered on regional endobariatric managers that are focused on the opportunity in that area. And so for the first group, their priorities, if you look across product lines, we think we still have excellent opportunities to continue to identify and train new users in OverStitch, and they're doing that. But also driving additional usage in our existing base. That's a very important focus. For X-Tack, it's -- the strategy we laid out last year of continuing to be quite focused on a targeted set of accounts, and really driving the model of increasing adoption remains a priority for us.  And as I just alluded to the importance of being able to do that across multiple users in both upper and lower GI is a real focus for that group. And then another focus, I'd say is to sell the whole bag. We've got some of our reps who are very good at selling ORBERA, and some who've got less experience in it. And I think given what we're seeing already in the marketplace of a nice bounce for that product, we've got a lot of share learnings on it that I think is going to help our sales organization expand the product across some regions that have had a lot of success, and make that more consistent. So we're pretty excited about the opportunities across each of those. And then for the -- these already [Indiscernible] roles I mentioned, we have a group of early adopters internally, we refer to as Wave 1 that's reference on one of the slides you saw. And to really learning from them, right? It's a mix of both academic and private practices. It's a mix of GIs and surgeons. So we got different models that are already having a lot of success across a range of endobariatric. So the balloon is big part of that, but then also some of the other procedures. So we're learning a lot about everything it takes to build and grow those kinds of practices, and then having a focus on what the next waves are going to look like. And we're just striking the right balance given the fact that we don't have any indication for the suture inside of it. But we absolutely to do a lot with the balloon, including those co-margin programs I mentioned. Matthew Blackman : Got it. I appreciate that and I'll just ask one more. I'm curious, you've called out the top ten accounts, something like greater than 600,000 in revenue. Are those accounts using multiple products within the APEN portfolio? Or is it largely driven by one product? I'm obviously trying to get at to what opportunity there may be to cross-sell. And obviously, as you've mentioned before, how you could turn that into a playbook for the rest of your accounts. Charles McKhann : I think you see there's a mix of accounts in there. Some of that are pretty broad-based, some of the larger academic settings that truly are using a whole range of the products, and really incorporating X-Tack into that as well. So you've got all three products that are involved. And then you've got some that are more endobariatric accounts that absolutely will use both the Balloon and OverStitch, probably not likely to use a lot of X-Tack, because the applications are more limited in that setting. Matthew Blackman : Got it. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Okay. The next question is coming from Adam Maeder from Piper Sandler. Your line is live. Adam Maeder : Hey, Charles, hey, Jeff. Thanks for taking the questions here and congrats on a nice year. Wanted to start with the guidance and see if we can just deconstruct that a little bit further particularly by segment. Just curious to get some additional color on how you think about the ESS franchise versus the balloon business in 2022. And if you're willing to kind of put any color around contribution from X-Tack, maybe we can start there and then I had a follow-up or two. Thanks. Charles McKhann : Yeah, I know. Thanks, Adam. You know what? As we look across, we see each product can continue to contribute to growth. Thinking in order a little bit, I think the -- on the balloon side, I think we're still learning frankly in terms of sustainable elements of growth and what it can deliver, but we're encouraged. Obviously, we had a very good year last year. I'm not -- we're not planning for another year of 50% growth, but I'd be nice. But we do think it can be a sustainable contributor, which given the history for the product line would be a really good outcome. And so we're looking at that, and as we implement more of these programs and get more one-way with it, we'll have more to build on to say sort of the level of sustainable growth. And then we see, I think, a good balanced contribution then across the other two products. Good opportunities with X-Tack here in the U.S., and then layering on depending on the timing of approvals outside the U.S., and so that can absolutely be out there both this year and beyond. And then a lot of excitement, obviously around OverStitch, both the core GI applications we continue to add new users there. And the opportunities as the year progresses on the weight loss side. And again, that I mentioned before, we really are trying to be appropriate and have the right level of where we're not the folks promoting the aspects around the weight loss side for OverStitch until we have the right indication. Jeff Black : Yes, Adam. Just to add to that, as you think about it, as we think about our long-term growth play, and we talked about this 20-plus percent long-term CAGR, I think you need to think about it as, yes, as OverStitch and X-Tack being the outsized growers relative to that 20% and ORBERA likely being behind that, but that's really how you get to the blended growth of 20 plus percent. If that's helpful. Adam Maeder : Yes, that's helpful color guys. And maybe just a quick follow-up on that, and then if I could squeeze in a third, I'll try my luck. But for the follow-up, wondering if you guys can put a finer point on ESG in revision, FDA approval timing. Any finer point or specific quarter where we should expect those to come on label? And then is there anything in terms of the guidance that you've had -- that you have issued $73 million to $75 million that currently contemplates revenue directly associated to those indications? Thanks. Charles McKhann : Yes. So when we submitted the application for the De Novo 510(k), I think even in the press release, Adam, we mentioned that, we had one of our outside law firms do an analysis that says on average, the De novo 5 10(K) takes 12 months. And each one is unique because there is no predicate. And we're working through the process, but we've mentally prepared ourselves for that kind of a timeline, which would put you in the second half of the year from a timing standpoint. But there's uncertainty around that, and we're going to do everything we can to move it along and support the process, hopefully to a successful conclusion. From that vantage point, given that kind of timeline, we haven't put a hockey stick kind of ramp into the sort of back half of our year, although we do know that even just general awareness in the community is having somewhat of a lift effect. So again, we're playing our role appropriately, but we do see a broader awareness about weight loss and endoscopic procedures, and people are coming to us interested about it. So -- and we can appropriately do things like training on the suturing techniques. But again, we're trying to be careful here. Adam Maeder : Okay. Really helpful, Chas. And just the last one if I may, just gross margin. Jeff, I think you gave some helpful puts and takes in the prepared remarks. But just want to kind of flush that out a little bit more. I think you have the mid 60s number in the slide deck over the next three to five years. Do we straight-line that from where we currently are to get there? Is it going to be a bit lumpy? Or I guess just trying to figure out exactly how we think about 2022 gross margin if you're willing to quantify to any extent. Thanks so much, guys. Appreciate it. Jeff Black : Sure. Yes, Adam. Thinking about '22, we haven't given specific guidance, but we will see expansion. I think it's more of an evolution of the margin and not a step change. I think that's the way you need to think about it. There's still a lot that we're working through in terms of the planning for the launch of new products, the configurations, pricing considerations, a lot to really think about in terms of what might drive longer-term margin. I think you think about '22 margin and even really '23 is more of a gradual evolution. Adam Maeder : Okay, got it. That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Okay. The next question is coming from Matt Hewitt from Craig - Hallum. Matt, your line is live. Matt Hewitt : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions and congratulations on the progress in '21. Maybe first up, and I don't know if this is a metric that you can provide or if you're going to focus on other areas. But as far as X-Tack accounts, where did the year end up? And as you look at '22, is it more about driving utilization and focusing on the quality of the accounts or is it still about grabbing new greenfield opportunities within new accounts entirely? Charles McKhann : Matt, I think the overall, it's still very much about the quality aspects. We do view this as a product that can be used quite widespread, but there are definitely learnings about the learning curve and nuances to even just, especially for people who aren't used to suturing. And it's much simpler than OverStitch, but it is for some of the alternative procedures are doing nothing. And so we want to make sure that people understand the product and how to use it well. And so we've got a heavy focus on a targeted set of accounts that are using the product -- sorry, that are doing these kinds of procedures at high volumes, and they are the primary focus for our sales organization. It doesn't mean we're not opening other additional accounts, but again, we really are trying to focus on that utilization metric because I think many people who have been involved with launches where you try to get out too quickly, get out to a lot of institutions or you're not getting the traction you want to get from a utilization standpoint, that continues to be a big focus with the team. We will continue then to build and grow over time by kind of the utilization first strategy in terms of how we do it. Matt Hewitt : That's helpful. And I guess along those lines and I really, as it might be a little bit early, but as the year progresses or as we maybe start looking at '23, will you start providing some utilization trends even if just high level to help us recognize the ramp that you're seeing within accounts. Charles McKhann : Yeah. Matt, it's a fair question. I think the answer is possibly. It's a competitively sensitive product as well. So we're trying to be as guarded as we can around how much we actually offer. But to the extent that we can continue to share more of our key metrics without compromising some of that, we'll do that. I mean, we try to lay out as an example our sequential percentage growth, 40%, we saw 20% increase in number of ordering accounts. And clearly, you probably don't have a good view on the baseline, but we're trying to give you what we can without sort of compromising some of the competitive sensitivity. Matt Hewitt : Completely understand, thank you. And then maybe one last one. Is there any update on the status of the Nash trial as far as timing or plans, whether or not there would just be ORBERA or whether we would include OverStitch? Any color on that process will be helpful. Thank you. Charles McKhann : Yeah. Now, Matt, it's a good question and one that we are working through, frankly. It's -- we've been with some experts in both the GI side of things and the hepatology side of things to really work through the learnings that have gone into recent trials in the NASH area. As I'm sure you're aware, there have been tens of trials, multiple trials on the drug side, many of which haven't been very successful. And so we're really trying to learn from those, while also taking a hard look at the data that we have for both Balloons and ESG, right? As we are collecting some additional data, you know MERIT has data on comorbidities, liver function was not one of them. But we've got some other studies in Europe that have reported some initial data that looks interesting.  And then you wrap in that there is still a whole ongoing set of discussions with CMS about exactly what their coverage policies might be for new technologies. The previous MCIT doesn't look like it's going forward, but they're talking about new versions of what they might do. So for all those reasons, we're taking a pretty deliberate approach to whether it's one product or both products, it's a one trial or multiple trials. As a small company, we probably only get one chance to get this right, so we're measuring twice, cut once approach here intentionally because there's just a lot of moving parts. Matt Hewitt : I completely understand. All right. Thank you. Operator : Okay. The next question is coming from Frank Takkinen from Lake Street Capital Markets. Your line is live. Frank Takkinen : Chas, Jeff, congrats on all progress. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask a couple more on the top 10 accounts. First, can you comment on how many of those top 10 are endobariatric -specific. And then 2, my assumption is there's been a little mix in the composition of those top 10 accounts. Can you comment on what's driving that, whether that's the OverStitch account and introduced X-Tack or endobariatric accounts that's growing quicker than the rest of the account base. Just any color around how the composition has changed and why would be great. Charles McKhann : Yeah. Then I would say the majority do fall under that category of endobariatric or at least where endobariatric is a significant portion of what they do. And so that's an important element. Some of those will also be doing some of the core GI procedures, so they may, as I said in fact be using X-Tack as well. And so I think we do have some where it's kind of all in, and you've got both -- all three product lines contributing to that growth. But I would say a number of them, and probably the majority is primarily being driven by the balloon and OverStitch at that level, right. Really driving sort of those, as I mentioned, $600,000 volumes. Those are typically when you have institutions that really are embracing the role for endoscopic therapies on the weight loss side. Again, with the balloon often being a big part of that. Frank Takkinen : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then two in the operating expense region. First, how do we think about sales force growth for 2022? And then secondly, thinking about just broad business investments sounds like that's going to take up pretty aggressively now that you have the funds to do so. Where should we expect to see that most in the operating expense structure? Jeff Black : Yeah, Frank, good question. I think the first question on the sales force growth, we ramped up to about 30 by the end of the year. We've made some incremental hires throughout the course of the first quarter. I think where we are now is that we were really more focused on making sure that the existing sales force is trained up and that they begin to ramp up and we start to see the programs that are working, the ones that aren't, and adjust. And so I think you'll definitely see a bit of a ramp in hiring Q1, and we'll probably start to see another ramp later in the year. So I think as as you start to think about sales and marketing expenses ramping in the near term, it is some of the run rate from the larger commercial sales rep footprint. But then it's also the investment in the marketing type programs around endobariatric s that Charles walked you through. And then as you think about investments beyond sales and marketing, the reimbursement initiatives, bringing Keely on board and building out that team, some of the clinical initiatives in terms of a deeper dive on X-Tack publications and NASH strategy that we hope we'll get more clarity on by the end of the year, and then across the R&D product portfolio, COGS improvement, it really is in many cases just really making up for some level of under-investment historically. Charles McKhann : Just one more thing on the salesforce. Just to give you an order of magnitude, Frank. Last year, we -- this is U.S. I'm talking about. We almost doubled the sales force to about 30. I'd say order of magnitude by the end of the year of 2022 will be in the range of call it 40 to 45. We're not looking to double again. Now, that could change. Things take off and we're going to evaluate that as we go. But just to give you a sense of our thinking, it's not doubling again. It's continuing to grow and split some of the larger territories continue to get depth in some of the markets where we know we can drive growth with our current footprint. While in parallel, we're going to evaluate the overall footprint. I mentioned these regional endobariatric managers. That's almost like a pilot, right? To see what that role, how it contributes, how it complements the existing roles, in advance of the newer indication. And so we'll see the exact structure and size as the year goes on. Frank Takkinen : Got it. That's helpful. I'll stop there. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : The next question is coming from Chris Cooley from Stephens. Your line is live. Ben Bienvenu : Hi. This is Ben on for Chris. Thanks for taking the question just a quick one for us. Given the current inflationary environment and your prior comments around potentially passing on price, I was just wondering if you could provide some additional color around any potential timing on those price uptakes. And then really how we can think about volume growth moving forward, if you do implement those. Thank you. Charles McKhann : Hi, Ben. So for OverStitch, we did take a price increase at beginning of the year. We have in the past taken a cost of living increase. It was modestly higher this year in light of the inflationary environment that we see, and so that was certainly part of our planning. And so we implemented that really at the start of the year. Jeff was alluding to also as we get the new indication and the new products, how exactly we price those in the marketplace is still something we're working through when that plays into things like some of our reimbursement strategies and other areas. So that determination will be more closely tied to the roll-out of the new products, and the systems as it were for ESG and revisions, which will certainly in the back half of the year or even beyond as we kind of think through that aspect of it. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the floor back to management for any closing remarks. Jeff Black : Awesome. Thanks again, folks for joining us. We really appreciate it. Very gratified with the progress we made in 2021 and looking forward to an exciting year ahead and thank you for your interest and the follow-up. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Apollo Endosurgery First Quarter 2022 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode, and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Matt Kreps. Sir, the floor is yours. Matt Kreps : Thank you, John. And thanks everyone for participating in today's call to discuss Apollo's first quarter 2022 financial and operating results. Joining me on the call are Chas McKhann, Chief Executive Officer and Jeff Black, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will include slides to accompany the audio presentation. For those of you joining us by telephone-only, you can download a copy of the slides at our investor relations site, ir.apolloendo.com and choosing Events and Presentations. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call today will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including Apollo's financial outlook and Apollo's plans and timing for product development and sales. In addition, there is uncertainty about the continued spread of COVID-19 virus and the ongoing impact it may have on our operations, the demand for our products, global supply chains, and economic activity in general. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties, and Apollo's actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent Form 10-Q. The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, May 3, 2022. Except as required by law, Apollo undertakes no obligation to revise or update any statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. Additionally, today's discussion will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide an additional tool for evaluating the company's core performance. Management uses these metrics in its own evaluation of continuing operating performance, and a baseline for assessing the future earnings potential of the company. Included in our press release issued today is our financial results and corresponding 8-K filing, our supplemental tables reconciling non-GAAP figures to their closest GAAP comparable. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Chas. Chas McKhann : Thank you, Matt, and thank you, everybody, for joining us here today. We really appreciate it. So look, we are about a year into a new strategy to transform Apollo. And I'm really excited about the progress that we've made in a relatively short period of time. We've repositioned the company to go after larger market opportunities, and we're building a much stronger organization that's poised to capitalize on those opportunities as we focus on energizing the business and then over the course of this year, moving into an acceleration mode and eventually building leadership positions in the markets we serve. This afternoon, we reported solid performance for the first quarter of the year with sales of $16.7 million, and that was even in the face of the Omicron wave that impacted a lot of companies and procedures around the world really, and then other global macroeconomic challenges, which we'll refer to over the course of the call. But despite that, and I'll -- some of the highlights for the quarter, we achieved 20% year-on-year growth. And it was well-balanced growth. It was 24% in our ESS franchise. That's our OverStitch device and our X-Tack product. And we also achieved 16% growth with our intragastric balloon franchise, and so again, nice balance across our products. This quarter, our growth was primarily driven by the US with 33% growth in the US, 40% for IGB franchise, 34% for ESS, so really nice performance here in the US. An interesting fact here over what we've observed, and this is an extension of what we reported on our prior call. Our top 10 accounts grew by 63% year-on-year. And these are not distributors, these are individual accounts. And the average sales in those top 10 accounts, is right around $1 million annualized. So it gives you a sense of what we can achieve, when our customers really incorporate Apollo's products into their clinical practice and really make it a focus of patient care. And then in addition, we achieved 14% sequential growth in the number of ordering accounts for X-Tack here in the US. And we also achieved sequential sales growth in terms of -- so ordering accounts up 14% as well as sequential growth in X-Tack sales quarter-on-quarter. And so while delivering on a strong quarter, we also remain very focused on a broader set of priorities for the overall year, both delivering on the near term but also building the foundation for the growth in years to come. And so, our four main priorities. First is to expand our core GI business and defect closure and fixation. And that's inclusive of both OverStitch and X-Tack. It involves training new users, continue to build adoption and preparing for the approval of X-Tack, the CE mark approval outside the US. Second priority is leveraging a resurgence in ORBERA. The intragastric balloon franchise has done very well since I've gotten here, and it's been a big important part of our business, continues to grow. We want to make sure that's sustainable growth, and we're putting a lot of focus and energy behind that. And that fits part and parcel with our third priority, which is preparing for the launch of Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE. We're working through the process with the FDA for a new regulatory clearance and preparing for the new product launch associated with that. And all the while building the organization. We need to have the right capabilities in place to make sure that we can go after those opportunities, and we've been making very important ads really top to bottom, and I will come back to that. So, Jeff is going to provide some updates on the financial results in the quarter, and then I will come back and talk through each of these four priorities to give you updates on how we're doing against each of them. Jeff? Jeff Black : Thank you, Chas, and thank you, everybody, for joining the call today. As Chas said, I'll spend a few minutes here on a little bit of a deeper dive into the financials and then turn it back over to Chas for a more detailed business update. Starting with slide 7 on revenue, again, a strong year-over-year growth across the product portfolio. It was our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. And excluding the legacy Lap-Band business, this was the largest revenue quarter on record for Apollo. 33% growth in the US, so we are beginning to see the impact of our planned investments, specifically the expansion of the sales force, while still early stages, we're beginning to see traction and increased productivity. We saw a continued strength in ORBERA on the heels of enhanced marketing efforts. And again, still some lingering effects of COVID on hospital access and staffing, particularly in academic hospitals, where core GI business is typically very strong. We saw 6% growth outside the US, strong demand in distributor markets, offset by continued pressure in the quarter in concentrated direct markets, particularly Western Europe, where we also believe to be lingering pandemic effects. Significant foreign currency impacts, particularly for the euro, which had a nearly $300,000 impact on year-over-year growth. On a constant currency basis, our OUS growth was 10%. Global growth was 22%. And just as a reminder, because international sales represent more than 40% of our overall revenue, we're disproportionately impacted by negative foreign currency impacts compared to similarly sized Medtech companies that typically don't have such a large OUS footprint. Other revenue, while it's not material, it was impacted by our planned wind down of Apollo Care for Orbera, which we outsourced to a third-party beginning in 2022. This will ensure we can properly scale support for Orbera, as that business continues to expand without a material financial impact to Apollo. Overall, we're again pleased with our revenue performance in the first quarter and our ability to successfully navigate a generally slow start for Medtech. In terms of outlook for 2022, we continue to expect 2022 revenue of $73 million to $75 million, while we're cognizant of potential global recessionary impacts, lingering pandemic headwinds and foreign currency pressures from a strengthened dollar, particularly for the euro, which currently represents nearly half of our OUS revenue. Moving to gross margin on Slide 8. Gross margin improved by 210 basis points over a year ago. In the US, our margin increased from a higher Orbera mix as well as margin expansion on our ESS product lines. We're seeing the impact of 2021 OverStitch COGS improvement projects. We're seeing improved overhead efficiencies, and we also saw some price increase impact for both OverStitch and X-Tack. The margin expansion that we saw in the US was offset by a higher mix of distributor sales, OUS, which have a lower gross margin profile. We remain focused on continued gross margin improvements, particularly with OverStitch, which has a lower gross margin profile than the Orbera and X-Tack. So major drivers continue to be in gross margin expansion in the future will be product mix, improved overhead absorption, direct COGS improvement programs, like I said, focused primarily on OverStitch. And at the same time, we're navigating supply chain and manufacturing scale-up complexities, but we remain confident that we'll drive blended gross margin to the mid-60% range in the next three to five years. Moving to OpEx on Slide 9. As we look at operating spend profile, as we've done in the past, we think it's important to exclude non-cash stock-based compensation to get just a clearer picture of what our non-GAAP core operating run rate is. And as we previously said, 2022 is an investment year for us. In the near-term, we remain focused on building capabilities following historical underinvestment in the business. The most significant area of increased investment is in sales and marketing in the United States. For example, in the fourth quarter, you'll see our non-GAAP sales and marketing OpEx ran at about 48% of revenue. This reflects our planned investments in growth initiatives, primarily building out the channel, marketing programs as we prepare for the anticipated launch of our ESG products. As we've said before, in the US, we still have a very small commercial team relative to the size of our opportunities. We made substantial progress a year ago or last year, expanding our footprint. We continue to do so. At the end of 2021, we had a commercial team of just under 30 in the field. We grew that to 30 territory managers and two regional Endobariatric managers at the end of the first quarter. This team is ramping up. We anticipate further improvements in rep productivity as they gain additional time and territory and experience with our products and customers. Going forward, we continue to evaluate the appropriate scale of our commercial team and we'll invest as necessary. Other focused area of our planned investments, are in R&D, medical education, clinical reimbursement, product development and gross margin improvement. And on the G&A side, we will continue to thoughtfully invest in infrastructure and staff to properly support the business, but we expect to see the heaviest investment in both sales and marketing and R&D. Importantly, that we have the ability to modulate spend as appropriate. And we're well positioned from a balance sheet perspective to make these investments. So with that said, before I turn it over to Ted, just a couple of comments on cash use and burn. Moving to our balance sheet, slide 10, as you may recall, last year, we secured over $175 million in new capital and borrowing capacity, enabling us to begin making investments required to capitalize on the opportunities in front of us without really creating a concern about cash runway. This positions us very well, with a multiyear runway to execute the business, which is especially important now in what has turned out to be an uncertain and volatile capital markets environment. As we expected, we saw a planned up-tick in cash burn in the first quarter relative to 2021. Of particular note, nearly 1/3 of that burn was $2.9 million in working capital, which represents the pay down of 2021 year-end accruals as well as inventory builds to support the expected growth in demand for our products. Even with our planned increase in average quarterly burn, we're extremely well positioned to execute on our planned growth initiatives with nearly $150 million in cash and committed cash at the end of the first quarter. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chas. Chas McKhann : Thank you, Jeff. So turning to slide 12, just a quick reminder for those who are new to Apollo, we've got our three different product lines, our X-Tack product, OverStitch and the ORBERA intragastric balloon and that's really focused across two different therapeutic areas : our advanced GI focus as well as endobariatric or endoscopic weight loss. And as you'll see on slide 13, we continue to be focused on large market opportunities and developing from a product standpoint, but also clinical development and reimbursement otherwise, all the different elements that we think will be required to go after these opportunities. I mentioned our four priorities across the business for the year. And so let's provide an update here on each of them. First, on the core GI, the defect closure and fixation side of our business. We've got OverStitch, which really is a unique one-of-a-kind product, primarily focused on full thickness suturing in the upper GI. We are continuing to work to build and develop the defect closure side of the business with OverStitch. That involves training new users as well as expanding the different applications that users -- that our customers use OverStitch and making sure that they're familiar with and really apply the product in such a wide range of opportunities, which we know it can in fact positively impact patient care. That's true also in the -- outside the U.S. where the core GI has been a lower percentage of our overall business for OverStitch, and we've got plans in place that we're executing to build that part of the business outside the U.S. We then add in X-Tack, which as you can see on the chart, is a really nice complement OverStitch. It fills an important therapeutic gap between Through-the-scope clips and OverStitch in terms of complexity of the defect and size of the defect and the durability of the fixation. And again, we continue to make very good progress. We just launched X-Tack right around this time last year. And so we're seeing still very good progress with customers. We continue to refine our targeting and focus on high-volume centers. We continue to develop our sales training. As Jeff mentioned, we have a relatively new sales force with more than half the reps in the US hired within the last year. We continue to build the supporting body of clinical evidence and I'm going to come back in a minute to the upcoming DDW Meeting, which is the Digestive Disease Week Meeting. It's the largest GI meeting in the world and we expect both OverStitch and X-Tack to be very well represented at that meeting. We're expanding our peer-to-peer marketing programs, both through things like webcast. We just did an outstanding one with Dr. Darin Dufault from Duke University as well as old-fashioned face-to-face meetings where colleagues can hear from each other in terms of how they're applying this new device into their clinical practices. And then finally, we are absolutely working on preparing for the OUS launch of X-Tack. We already have a presence in a few select markets outside the US. The most recent one has been Australia, which we are just getting going here as of this month. But the key one will be getting CE Mark clearance for X-Tack, and we're still working through that regulatory process and -- but preparing commercially for when that occurs, and we'll be excited when it does. The next slide just shows some of the -- just the complements around OverStitch and X-Tack. You can see the kind of blue dots on the page, and for those of you who aren't -- don't have the slides in front of you, basically, what it's showing is that X-Tack opens up the right side of the colon, the lower GI for us. And that's where the predominant of procedures are in the lower GI and these are polyp-removal procedures. So, think about when you're in your colonoscopy and they find a large polyp defect that needs to be removed. If it's over about two centimeters, there's a lot of evidence that those are the defects that need to be prophylactically closed. And that's an important target market for X-Tack. But in addition, our customers are finding many other core applications for the device, which is great to see and many of them are listed on the page. So, fistulas and perforations, a POEM procedure, which is more of an upper GI procedure, mucosal tear, there's a whole range. And so we're pleased to see the progress there and continue to build and capitalize on that. Next slide. So, next up is ORBERA. Again, we want to continue to maintain the momentum with ORBERA and really ensure that it's sustainable because it's been a tremendous turnaround for a product and a category that frankly struggled for a number of years, but we've seen very nice growth with ORBERA. We've seen it globally. We continue to capitalize on some macro factors in terms of weight gain during the pandemic and coming out of the pandemic, I think, has been favorable to a product that has a lot of evidence of at least a 10% total body weight loss. Right around this time last year, we have the new AGA Clinical Practice guidelines. First time ever that a major society endorsed intragastric balloon therapy and that's kind of a seal of approval as it were for intragastric balloon therapy. We are proud of the fact that ORBERA has, by far, the most clinical evidence of any intragastric balloon in the market and it's an important element to a safety and trust element around the product. We've seen an increase in physician interest. We've done more training for ORBERA in the US in the past few months than we've done in a number of years. And we're putting more focus on it from a sales and marketing standpoint, which is helping to contribute to the sustainability of those results. And then importantly, we're seeing some very important competitive wins outside the US. In the US, we are primarily the main product available for intragastric balloons. There's a recent market entrant that's still in the very early stages of having to do a post-approval trial. So we're really in the US. Outside the US, it is a very competitive market, but we are seeing nice wins outside the US that are helping to contribute to our ongoing growth. And it comes back to you that we've got a really good product with a long track record of safety and efficacy. And then that ties right into our broader strategy around endobariatric, and our preparation for the launch of Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE. So we showed this slide on the last earnings call, and I'll just use this as an opportunity to provide some important updates as we are working across a broad comprehensive launch plan for these products. We are still working through the De Novo 510(k) clearance with the FDA and we'll look forward to providing input an update on that as things progress. We are actively engaging with leading physician societies on both the GI and the surgery side. On the GI side, there's groups like the American Gastroenterology Association and the ASGE, two of the leading societies as well as ACG, so a lot of GI societies. There's also major surgical societies. So SAGES and then the ASMBS, which is the metabolic Surgery Society. And we've been spending a lot of time with them describing our plans around the new indications, talking to them about where we see endoscopic therapies fitting within the broader continuum of care and making sure that we've got good alignment across, again, both GIs and surgeons. And then talking about ways we can best work together on important elements of things like training and education and support on efforts on things like reimbursement and market access. And those have been very productive discussions. And I think a big part of a broader market development process that we're working on. We are aware of efforts that a number of these societies already have underway on things like clinical practice guidelines. Now those processes take time. There's a lot that goes into a new set of practice skylines. But the fact that they're already working on those efforts is a really good sign that the societies are looking towards where these new procedures will fit in the broader continuum of care. We are also actively learning from our early adopters. There are a number of customers, both in -- outside the US as well as in the US that are already incorporating ESG and revisions into their clinical practice. We are very careful from a promotional standpoint, but physicians can use OverStitch for these procedures. And so, we are already kind of learning from those customers. And we call them internally the waven accounts. And it's really interesting because what we're seeing is a really nice mix of different models. We see some models that are in academic medical centers, some of the leading centers in the world. We see others that are individual private practice physicians or small groups of physicians, and we're seeing success in either case. We're seeing some models that are surgeon led. We're seeing some models that are GI led. We've seen some that are integrated, GIS and surgeons working together. There are commonalities though. The ones that are most successful have a laser focus on clinical outcomes and how they're working to make sure before the procedure, during the procedure and after the procedure and patient follow-up that they're doing everything necessary to achieve the best possible outcomes for patients. And so we're kind of going to school on those initial set of customers. We're developing the playbooks that we will be using with the next waves of accounts as they move forward once we get a new indication. In the meantime, we can gain a lot of practical experience with ORBERA. I mentioned the renewed marketing efforts around ORBERA. I'll give you an example. We are doing co-marketing programs with some of these Wave 1 accounts, frankly, who offer the intragastric balloon, as well as some other accounts that have demonstrated the ability to attract patients and talk to them about the procedures and ensure that if you're doing marketing, patient marketing, that it results in actual procedures. And so, we've been able to do that with ORBERA. We initiated this late last year and had been moving forward here and having really good outcomes and experience and measurable results that we can both obviously support the ORBERA business, but also learn in terms of how this will play ultimately in a broader endobariatric world. So we're excited by those early learnings, and we're going to keep building on them. And then last, but certainly not least, we are absolutely building out our reimbursement and market access team. We, in January, announced the hiring of a new VP of Reimbursement and Market Access. Chas since added a Director of Payer Engagement, who has already joined and is a full-time employee focused specifically on how we will work with payers. And we are strengthening our capabilities in areas like health economics and others. So this is a critically important area and a broader market development and a set of skills and capabilities that we are really building here at Apollo. So a few times now, I've already mentioned the upcoming Digestive Disease Week meeting, and we're really excited about it. So this is the largest gastroenterology meeting in the world. This is the first time the meeting will be taking place in person for three years. It's been gone to virtual in the last couple of years. And so, as we talk to people in the medical community, they're really excited to get back together. I think the fact that it's in San Diego doesn't hurt. But as part of that, what we're really looking forward to is that, simply put, we expect DDW to be an excellent showcase of Apollo's products and procedures. They've only, at this point, released the preliminary agenda. More details will be coming out in the next week or two. So even based off of these preliminary information from the organizers, we are already aware of over 40 posters and video presentations about Apollo products and procedures and more than 60 lectures and podium presentations. So there's going to be a lot of discussion about Apollo products at the meeting, and including some important new clinical data and new clinical studies. So let me highlight a few there. And again, this is a preliminary list, before the meeting, we will likely do a press release informing you of others to be on a lookout for DDW. First is the MERIT study. Many of you know, MERIT is the randomized controlled trial that Apollo sponsored, testing the ESG procedure compared to diet and exercise. The preliminary results were presented at the IPSO meeting, a surgery meeting in a virtual session in October. And I'm pleased to report that, at DDW, the full results of MERIT will be released by Dr. Barham Abu Dayyeh in two sessions, both in a plenary session on Saturday, May 21, and then again in more detail in a full session on Tuesday at the meeting. So very excited for the full results for MERIT. It will just be additive to the information we've already -- that's already been presented. Another really interesting presentation will come from Dr. Chris McGowan. Chris is -- Dr. McGowan is based out of Cary, North Carolina, private practice position at True You Weight Loss. He does an excellent job of following up all his patients, and he's going to be presenting data on patients with Class III obesity, meaning patients with a BMI of more than 40. And so we're looking forward to those data and the presentation of Dr. McGowan. Dr. Reem Sharaiha from Cornell is going to be presenting a five-year follow-up data with comorbidity information and the impact on comorbidities, and Dr. Beran is also going be presenting systematic review, pardon me \u2013 and meta-analysis comparing ESG to laparoscopic sleeves. And again, this is just a cross-section of some of the data that will be presented. On the revision side, Dr. Anna Carolina Hoff has a oral presentation focused on combination therapy of revisional procedures along with GLP-1 inhibitors. As many of you may recall that last year at the DDW meeting, Dr. Hoff had one of the top papers at DDW focused on combination therapy of ESG plus semaglutide. It was a randomized controlled trial and the headline was basically that when you combine ESG plus semaglutide, which has the brand name Wegovy, you get essentially surgical level of outcomes. It was more than 25% total body weight loss in that study. And so we're excited to see the new presentation from Dr. Hoff. And we are well aware that some of the newer medications, including semaglutide and the recent results from a new medication from Eli Lilly and Company. We expect will have an important impact in addressing the global obesi epidemic, but we see a really interesting role in combination therapies, and so more data on that will be coming at DDW. Not to be outdone, the defect closure side of our business will also be very well represented at the meeting. There is a session, I think, this is on Saturday that Dr. Christopher Gostout, who is our Chief Medical Officer, is co-chairing with Dr. Harry Aslanian from Yale University that's going to be talking about defect closure in everyday practice. And that will include discussions around suturing with OverStitch and case studies with X-Tack. There is new data from a multicenter experience on X-Tack. There is a new another study looking specifically at X-Tack in colonic EMR defects. There's another paper involved with ESD closure. So again, this is just a summary of what we expect to be a significant amount of information at the meeting, so we're excited about that. Speaking of clinical data, a study that was released in Q1 that I'll draw your attention to. And I'm on slide 20 for those who are following along. This was in GIE -- Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, which is one of the leading journals in the field. So the study was authored by Dr. Alqahtani out of Saudi Arabia. And one of the most impressive element -- one element is just the scale of the study. It is -- it involves more than 3,000 patient pairs. It's a propensity match study of ESG compared to patients who received laparoscopic sleeve. So that's more than a 6,000 patient study, which is really unusual in the device world. Some of the headlines is that it showed durable results with ESG out to three years with a 14% total body weight loss at sustained out to three years. In addition, the comorbidity remission in this study with ESG was very similar to what was found in LSG patients. And, in fact, was slightly better in the areas of dyslipidemia and hypertension. Showed an excellent safety profile for the procedures. We're just showing that in real-world clinical practice, ESG is a very safe procedure. And then also provides good evidence that, if patients needed it, they could either get a repeat ESG basically a retightening, or they could revert to an LSG. And that's important. It's an important element to be able to leave all options open to patients. And we've known that about ESG, but to have additional clinical data that shows the feasibility of that, important, especially to a surgical audience who like to know that they can still have different options available to them. Turning now to the organization side of our business and things we're developing. On the left is a summary of the core values of Apollo that we've really focused on. We're very focused on building a strong culture of the company, a winning culture that's customer-focused, it's patient-focused, and it's a big part of who we are. So we've been introducing these internally. It's becoming a big part of how we manage our business. And all the while, we are adding to the organization really from top to bottom as it were. We are very pleased to announce just a few weeks ago, having announced the hiring of Jeannette Bankes to join our Board of Directors. Jeannette is the President and General Manager of the Global Surgical franchise at Alcon. And she brings tremendous experience in developing and commercializing new technologies, including in markets around the world. So really good global experience and so we are thrilled to have Jeanette join our Board of Directors. I mentioned new hires in the reimbursement and market access side. We've promoted a new Head of VP of R&D to really renew and reengage our efforts on the pipeline development. And then as Jeff mentioned, we are selectively and very targeted making additions throughout the organization to make sure that we've got the right scale to grow. One of the biggest areas that we are focusing on, and you saw it in the financial numbers, has been on our commercial team and so just an update of where we are. We are \u2013 as Jeff mentioned, we've grown \u2013 added a few positions here over the first part of the year in the US and plan to continue to grow over the course of the year. We are adding new training capabilities as we do have a relatively new team. And we've seen increased productivity as we brought people on board, but we absolutely expect that to continue going forward. We're improving our sales and analytics. And as I described in some of the launch planning for ESG, we really are building out our marketing capabilities as well. Importantly, on the OUS side of our business, as Jeff mentioned, it is more than 40% of our business, and we're making important additions there as well. Again, selective adds in key markets to drive growth, especially on the ESS side and preparing for the X-Tack launch. We really have reignited our physician training programs outside the US. They did struggle for a while during the COVID period, and even into next year because many of those trading programs do require travel. And as we all know, international travel has had its challenges. But when they are fully running again, we've had great participation. And we're also developing plans to expand into large untapped market opportunities. Just today in the earnings release, we announced in Japan. So we've had some access into Japan through some limited use kind of pathways, but we've just received clearance for OverStitch Sx in Japan, which is a nice opportunity for us. We still have some work to do on the reimbursement front, but this will allow us to continue to build and grow there. We've got initial footholds into the Chinese market that also can build and grow and expand over time. And somewhat ironically, given the sale of our international business in Canada, we currently have clearances for the Intragastric Balloon, but do not have yet clearances for X-Tack and OverStitch, and we're working to address those as well. So continued significant growth opportunities outside the US while we grow and develop in the US as well. And by the way, when I mentioned the prelaunch planning around ESG and Apollo REVISE, many of the elements that we're working on in the US have broad applicability outside the US as well, because we are able to really -- for example, the reimbursement efforts that we focus on here in other markets, we will focus on as well. And so to wrap up, we delivered a solid quarter in Q1 despite some of the macroeconomic headwinds, and we also have made substantial progress across each of our priorities for the year, and we remain very excited about the prospects for our products and our procedures and the impact that we can have in markets around the world. And so with that, let me turn it back over to John for the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Okay. And the first question here is coming from Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum Capital. Your line is live Q \u2013 Matt Hewitt : Thank you. And congratulations on the strong quarter, kind of bucking the normal seasonal pattern, especially given the headwinds you faced in January from COVID. I guess my first question is regarding progress with X-Tack, I think last quarter, you really started to focus on your desire to drive utilization. I think during your prepared remarks, you mentioned 14% growth, if I heard you correctly. Do you have kind of a target that you're hoping to hit from a utilization standpoint, or how should we be looking at that over the remainder of this year and going forward? A \u2013 Chas McKhann : Yes. No, Matt, thank you. Appreciate the question. We were pleased with sequential growth, both in new accounts as well as in overall utilization with X-Tack. That was despite what often we do see some seasonal patterns as well as there was a pretty significant COVID impact here in the first part of the quarter. It improved as the quarter progressed. I think that's a very consistent theme with other med tech companies as well. And so we will look to continue to build on that same kind of quarter-on-quarter additional growth as we -- as our newer reps get up to speed as it were as new data comes out, all the different elements I mentioned. And so we feel good about a prime continued sequential growth quarter-to-quarter, and that's what we'll be looking for from our US sales team. And then over time, we'll add on the US side of that as well. Q \u2013 Matt Hewitt : Understood. Okay. And then one of the questions that I get a lot, especially here over the past couple of weeks when others from -- on the device side have been reporting is this question about how much of Q1, were you seeing a rebound in just getting back to normal, or was there some backlog to kind of work through? And maybe if you could walk through what you're seeing even now through April, are we getting back to a normal that it's not so much a backlog. This is a normal growth rate for the business and what we should be expecting going forward? A \u2013 Chas McKhann : Yes, it's a good question and one that's a little hard to tease out, except to say that we certainly saw an impact in late last year and early this year. We did see a nice improvement over the course of the quarter. But I think it varies by different segments and different markets. We didn't see a sort of snapback rebound that, I think, for example, orthopedics, some did. Because where we saw the biggest impacts were in some of the larger academic medical centers and the equivalents in places like Europe, and those have come back, but a bit more gradually because you have a combination of both COVID, but also -- and I'm sure you guys have all heard about various staffing-related issues that impact a lot of those same institutions. So we're seeing an improvement, but we haven't really felt it as a snapback rebound more just a good gradual improvement and I think we're tracking in the right direction. Matt Hewitt : Got it. And then maybe one last one for me, and I'll hop back in the queue and it kind of touches on what you're just saying there, as far as staffing issues and some of that, I think, at least on the hospital side, as we're reading it is some doctors are just transferring from one hospital to another. In other cases, they are leaving the market. But does that -- I would imagine that, that actually can represent an opportunity for you as well, a doctor that's familiar with OverStitch and Orbera and X-Tack and leaving one practice and going to another, bringing you along gives you a new in a new group to train or bring up to speed. Are you seeing some of that with some of the issues that healthcare has been seeing on the hiring side, or what could -- what do you think is going to drive that next leg of adoption, or is it just hitting the payment and introducing the products. Chas McKhann : Yes. Now let me separate out two things. I think the bigger constraint we've seen has been more on the nurse side than on the physician side. And again, these have been well documented and just in the types of settings I've mentioned. And I think the situation is improving, but that's been coming out of COVID, just a challenge for certain institutions. And I think, like I said, they're starting to get a handle on it and it's improving. On the physician side, there is some movement, but mostly for us, it really is just a matter of continuing to train new users for -- across our products. And then doing, as you said, the leg work once someone is trained, making sure they become totally comfortable with the devices and the procedures and expanding the different kinds of procedures they can use it for in the case of both OverStitch and X-Tack. And in the case of the Orbera side of things, understanding how to really develop their practices and patient marketing some of those other areas where we're doing some of the co-marketing elements. Matt Hewitt : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Okay. The next question is coming from Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler. Your line is live. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, Charles and Jeff, this is Simran on for Adam. Congrats on a great quarter, guys. I guess I'll start off asking about just kind of your business and exiting Q1, you said there's some momentum with recovery. So how should we think about models in Q2 and quarterly cadence throughout the duration of the year? Chas McKhann : Sure. We've -- we've been investing, as Jeff mentioned, in different aspects of growth. And so certainly are looking to continue to see that. We saw a good evidence of results of that in Q1, but I do expect to see that progress. And certainly to achieve our guidance range for the year, we expect that to continue to step up and are focused on delivering on that. And that will be globally based to get things like some order patterns outside the US with some of our distributors as well. And so we feel good about a nice progression here and reiterating our guidance even with -- and Jeff alluded to this, but just to be really clear, we do have a bit of a headwind on the FX side, more than most companies our size, but are still focused on the guidance we've delivered and internally, we want to exceed that. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Perfect. Should we be seeing any meaningful impact from the cadence of new product launches that you could potentially be having this year in terms of ESG revised as well as OverStitch in Japan, just kind of what can you say about the impact of these launches and approvals? Chas McKhann : Sure. Yeah. No, so for ESG and revise, when we submitted to the FDA, which was back in -- late in Q3 of last year, we said that on average, de novo 510(k) take about a year. That is average. There is -- there are wide error bars in those data because de novo 510(k) almost by definition, have a little bit more uncertainty than a traditional 510(k). So it's a little hard to pinpoint. We are preparing for it, and we hope to see that in the second half of the year and doing everything we can to support that process. The -- another big launch that we are working on, clearly, is the X-Tack launch outside the US. We have spoken on previous calls about there's a regulatory change in paradigm going on in Europe. There's a transition to the medical device regulations MDR. You guys may be familiar with your other med tech companies you follow as well. The net result of that is just things are taking longer. And so if we do see an impact, it would be later in the year that we expect, and we said that throughout that it's going to take a while. And then the Japan side for OverStitch, we're very pleased to get the clearance. As I mentioned in my comments, there's still some regulatory work to be done to really open up the market around OverStitch, but it will, I think, on the margin, have some positive impacts on our US business. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Perfect. And then if I could squeeze in one more. Anything to call out from a supply chain standpoint? And just going off of that, how should we think about gross margin trajectory this year with those gross margin improvement projects that you guys are working on for OverStitch in particular? Jeff Black : Yeah, Serena [ph], this is Jeff. Yeah, I think as we've said in the past, I think -- we don't expect that we'll see any sort of step change in margin. It will be a gradual improvement. And a lot of what you saw in -- or what you saw in Q1 was really a mix of a number of factors, overhead efficiency. And as we improve the top line, we'll start to see even better efficiencies on overhead absorption. We did start to see the impact of the cost improvement projects that we executed last year. We'll continue to see those. So I would say expect more of a gradual improvement as opposed to any step change in any single quarter. Your question on supply chain, I would characterize our supply chain complexity is less about supply and more about just ensuring that we are working closely with our contract manufacturers on capacity and staffing. But we've not run into any situations where we're overly concerned about either incremental costs that we're not expecting or significant capacity constraints that we're not able to address. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Perfect. Thank you for taking my questions. Chas McKhann : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Up next, we have Chris Cooley with Stephens. Your line is live. Chris Cooley : Good afternoon and congratulations on a great start to the year. Just two quick ones for me, if I may. First, when you think about your top 10 accounts, that was very impressive when we think about the sequential dollar or the implied annual run rate growth coming from about $600,000 at the end of last year to approximately $1 million now. Could you help us better understand the characterization of these accounts? I'm assuming these are primarily endobariatric practices, but what's leading to that kind of step-up in growth? And then how do you scale that beyond those top 10? I've got one quick follow-up after that. Thank you. Chas McKhann : Yes, Chris. We're excited to see the traction that some of these larger accounts are getting. And it's a mix in terms of the nature of the accounts. Some of them are not endobariatric. I mean they're just kind of broad-based users of across the portfolio, some of the larger academic centers. But I would say the majority -- and this is -- it's a global list, so inclusive of both the US and internationally are some of these early adopters are really embracing the endobariatric side of things. And so for that group, that goes back to a bit of the homework we're doing on how they're approaching the markets, right? They are seeing a really good response to, frankly, the procedures they're offering, right, between intragastric balloons and being a part of that for many of them, not all, but for most. But then also with the ESG and endoscopic revisions, it's a nice affirmation for us that the value proposition resonates with patients. And that's true today even in a primarily cash pay environment or as I've mentioned before, in the kind of case-by-case reimbursement situations that some have access to. But it's been really nice to see. And we will be excited at a time when we do have indication to say how do we support that or look to ways that others can follow in their footsteps. Chris Cooley : Appreciate the additional color there. And then you touched on this a little bit in a prior question, but I just want to make sure we fully appreciate the underlying kind of trends here. But when we think about X-Tack, I realize it's still very early days there. But just going back to the third quarter of last year and in the fourth quarter, and then now, we've had a fairly decent deceleration sequentially in the growth rate. And you touched on COVID, obviously, as we started the calendar year, some seasonality there and I'm assuming heightened focus on OverStitch post the MERIT study. But can you just kind of help us unpack a little bit that sequential deceleration in the growth rate from the 4Q to the 1Q? I think it was 40 to 14, if I have my math correct and 70 back in the third quarter, which I would assume would be arbitrarily high as you were ramping up. But just help us kind of understand that trend and then how we should think about that going forward here throughout calendar 2022? Thank you. Chas McKhann : Yes, I think there are a number of factors going on, Chris. One is there is some things around, for example, both seasonality and some COVID impacts, which impacts a bit of what you see in terms of those numbers. We also see, as you move from an environment early on in the launch where a lot of it has to do with some stocking of new accounts and moving to true utilization. And so I think our utilization -- our underlying growth in utilization is probably a little higher from that standpoint. And then we're continuing, I think, in the kind of focus with our sales team of building that sustainable growth. And certainly, we'd like to see continued and even improved quarter-on-quarter growth. And some of that is just some of the newer folks fully getting up to speed and delivering it and producing at the level we expect them to. So, it's a big focus area for us to make sure we continue to sustain it. And I do think that additional clinical information and critical validation around X-Tack, for example, at DDW meeting, will help a lot. Chris Cooley : Thank you. Operator : Okay. The next question is coming from Matthew Blackman with Stifel. Your line is live. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Colin on for Matt. I wanted to focus on X-Tack for a minute. As you guys mentioned, it's currently underweight in that lower GI use segment, which is really a much broader market opportunity. What are sort of the next steps in addressing that opportunity? Are you focused on education as the first priority, or is it really access to practices with a different focus than your new overage practices, you use OverStitch and ORBERA a lot, or is it really adding that clinical data, which you guys plan to present at DDW? Thanks. Chas McKhann : Yeah. Thanks, Colin. It's a little bit of all the above. You've kind of touched on a number of the things that we are in the process of doing and have been, but I think are really emphasizing here. One, it's not surprising that we have an established customer base that is more familiar in the upper GI, and so really pushing our reps to move beyond kind of the established customers into a broader set. That is easier to do as we expand our team and they've got kind of smaller territories. And so we're absolutely doing that. We also have better targeting data with more recent clinical procedure numbers that allows them to be able to really focus on where the volumes are and make sure they're engaging the right physicians there. We're doing more in terms of engaging some of the key KOLs that really are the experts in the lower GI and having good -- very good experiences with some of them. But I do think the last piece around clinical data does matter. And so some of the data sets in colonic EMRs, that I mentioned in my opening comments, will be important. We don't know the outcomes of those studies, but we -- anecdotally, we've heard very good things about how people have done. So again, once we certainly know the outcomes of what is presented and both presentations and posters at DDW, being able to leverage that in those conversations. And a lot of the peer-to-peer kind of marketing is really important. I mentioned doing webcast and face-to-face, just making sure people are hearing from their colleagues about how they are incorporating this new approach into their clinical practice. Inertia is a powerful thing in medicine, and we're looking to change that. Unidentified Analyst : I appreciate that. And then on the new hires in the U.S. at late 2022 and -- a late 2021 and during the first quarter, I was wondering if they're focused on preparing for either the X-Tack U.S. launches or the ESG revised releases and approvals or if they're really focused on selling the full bag of the three products? Any color there would be helpful? Thanks. Chas McKhann : Sure. So we're kind of doing two things simultaneously. We've got our territory managers that typically are focused on selling each of the products. And especially as a new hire getting up to speed on the training around them, the procedures, supporting the accounts and focusing across all three products. In parallel, Jeff and his comments on one of the slides we've mentioned, this newer role of what we're calling a regional endobariatric manager. These are folks that are either been hired or in some cases, rehired or come back to Apollo, who understand all of the different components that will be required to really have a successful practice kind of from a patient standpoint, before the procedure, during the procedure and after the procedure and can really help support and develop those efforts. For now, it's very much focused on ORBERA, because it's on label for us, and they can kind of focus on those efforts while getting to know the practice is involved. And right now, as Jeff mentioned, at the end of the quarter, we have two of those roles very much was a pilot phase to make sure it's delivering the way we think it can. And then assuming, it does and as we move forward with the indication, that's an area that we would plan to enhance and grow. So you have not a splitting of the sales force, but kind of a layering of different capabilities. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : I would now like to turn the floor back to Chas McKhann for closing remarks. Chas McKhann : Well, listen, thank you all very much for joining us today. We appreciate your time and your support. On this slide, we have upcoming activities, and you're welcome to join of them. And then otherwise, we really appreciate your time today. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Apollo Endosurgery Second Quarter 2022 Results. At this time all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Matt Kreps. Sir, the floor is yours. Matt Kreps : Thank you, Matthew and thanks, everyone, for participating in today's call to discuss Apollo's second quarter 2022 financial and operating results. Joining me on the call are Chas McKhann, Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Black, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will include slides to accompany the audio presentation. For those of you joining us by telephone only, you can download a copy of the slides at our Investor Relations site, ir.apolloendo.com, under Events and Presentations. Before we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including Apollo's major outlook and Apollo's plans for timing -- for product development and sales. In addition, there is uncertainty about the continued spread of the COVID-19 virus and the ongoing impact it may have on our operations, the demand for our products, global supply chains and economic activity in general. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties and Apollo's actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent Form 10-Q. The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, August 2, 2022. Except as required by law, Apollo undertakes no obligation to, revise or update any statements to reflect events or circumstances after the day of this call. Additionally, today's discussion will include certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe provide an additional tool for evaluating the company's core performance. Management uses these metrics on its own in its own evaluation of continuing operating performance and as a baseline for assessing the future earnings potential of the company. Included in the press release today with our financial results and corresponding 8-K filing are supplemental tables reconciling non-GAAP figures to their closest GAAP comparable. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chas. Chas McKhann : Thanks, Matt and good afternoon thank you, everyone, for joining us. On today's call, I'll cover highlights of our Q2 performance. Jeff will then cover our financial results and I'll come back and talk to you in more detail about our recent milestones and launch plans for the Apollo ESG and the Apollo REVISE devices. So starting on Page 3 of our deck, our strategy has been to pursue large market opportunities and build an organization that is primed to capitalize on them. And I'm pleased to say that our recent performance has been good validation of this approach. Q2 was a solid quarter for us. We demonstrated revenue of $19.3 million in reported sales and just under $20 million in constant currency. This performance represents a really nice step-up compared to our recent sales levels and the growth has come ahead of two very recent and important catalysts that we've just announced in the last month, the FDA market authorization for the Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE devices and publication just last week of the MERIT study in The Lancet. So turning to Page 5, where we've listed both constant currency growth on the left and then GAAP growth on the right. In Q2, we achieved 20% growth in constant currency and 16% year-on-year growth on a GAAP basis. Once again, our growth has been well balanced across both products and geographies. On a GAAP basis, ESS grew 23%, with strong growth in the U.S. of 22% and international growth of 24%. Our IGB franchise grew 6% on a reported basis, 7% in the U.S., 5% outside the U.S. so again, nice balance across the business and across geographies. As with any U.S.-based company that has a significant presence in Europe, foreign exchange has presented a headwind, it's important to note that Apollo unusual for a med tech company of our size has just under 45% of our sales from outside the U.S. and more than half of that is in Europe. Many of you will know that a year ago, the euro is at $1.20, it's now at $1.02. And so it is a significant impact. But again, we're pleased with the reported 16% and the 20% year-on-year growth from a constant currency standpoint. So again, I'll come back to you with an update from a business and strategic standpoint but let's allow Jeff to walk through the financials. Jeff? Jeff Black : Thank you, Chas and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. I'll spend a few minutes with a financial update give a little commentary on the rest of the year guidance and some discussion about some medium-term targets. First off on Slide 7, just starting off of revenue today again, as Chas said, we reported another quarter of strong year-over-year growth across the whole product portfolio. It's our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This was the largest revenue quarter on record for Apollo on book of GAAP on a constant currency basis. We grew 18% in the U.S. We're continuing to see the impact of our planned investments. Growth is led by adoption in our endobariatric accounts which Chas will dive into later. We're seeing the benefits of sales force expansion, increased sales force productivity, the continued strength in Orbera on the heels of enhanced marketing efforts. We saw procedural volumes improved throughout the second quarter. There have been some lingering COVID effects but nowhere near to the extent that we saw at the beginning of Q1. We're still seeing some staffing shortages in some hospitals, particularly in academic hospitals, where the -- core GI business is typically very strong. We grew 9% OUS on a constant currency basis again, strong demand in both direct and distributor markets and some competitive wins for both OverStitch and Orbera in some key accounts. We also saw foreign currency headwinds, as Chas mentioned, particularly for the euro which had a nearly $600,000 impact on our year-over-year Q2 growth. And as Chas mentioned, because international sales represent more than 40% of our overall sales we're disproportionately impacted by negative foreign currency impacts compared to similarly sized med tech companies that typically do not have such a large OUS footprint. In other revenue, while not material, was impacted by our planned wind down of our Apollo Care program for Orbera which was outsourced to third-party beginning in 2022. Overall, we're again pleased with our revenue performance in the second quarter and our ability to continue to expand adoption across the portfolio. Moving to revenue guidance on Slide 8, we continue to expect 2022 revenue in the $73 million to $75 million range, cognizant of potential global recessionary impacts lingering pandemic headwinds and most significantly foreign currency pressures from the strengthened dollar, particularly for the euro which currently represents nearly half of our OUS revenue. Our guidance implies fiscal year 2022 growth of 16% and 19% and second half year-over-year growth of about 17% which is essentially flat sequential growth against first half on a GAAP basis. Some of this can be attributed to Q3 seasonality which is typical in our business and we're seeing some of it play out in July. But the biggest impact is foreign currency headwinds. To put this in perspective, the euro foreign currency rate is down 11% since the beginning of 2022 and we've seen similar pressures in most of our OUS geographies. So, on a full year basis we expect foreign currency headwinds of up to $2.1 million in the second half of the year and $3 million on a full year basis. And guidance then on a constant currency basis now implies fiscal year '22 growth and second half '22 growth in the low to mid-20% range. Moving to Slide 10 on non-GAAP OpEx as we look at our -- my apologies, gross margin on Slide 9. As you can see, we're on track with our margin expansion targets. Gross margin improved by 190 basis points versus the first quarter -- of the second quarter of last year. On a constant currency basis, our gross margin improved by 320 basis points to just over 58%. Sequentially, gross margin improved 50 basis points over the first quarter. We saw gross margin expansion on our ESS product line from the impact of 2021 OverStitch COGS improvement projects. We saw improved overhead efficiencies. We also saw some price increase impact for both OverStitch and X-Tack. Major drivers of overall gross margin expansion will continue to be product mix, improved overhead absorption and direct COGS improvement programs focused primarily on OverStitch. We continue to navigate supply chain and manufacturing scale up complexities but we remain confident in our ability to drive blended gross margin to the mid-60% range in the medium term. Now moving to Slide 10 on OpEx as we look at operating spend profile, we think it's important to exclude non-cash stock-based compensation to get a clearer picture of our non-GAAP core operating expense run rate. As we previously said, 2022 is an investment year. In the near term, we're focused on building capabilities following historical underinvestment in the business, the most significant area being sales and marketing in the U.S. For example, in the second quarter, our non-GAAP sales and marketing OpEx ran about 45% of revenue which reflects our planned investments and growth initiatives, primarily in building out our sales channel as we prepare for the launch of Apollo ESG and REVISE products. Our other focused areas of planned investment are in R&D, medical education, clinical reimbursement, product development and again, COGS improvement. And on the G&A side, we'll continue to thoughtfully invest in infrastructure and staff to properly support the business. As we stated, 2022 is an investment year for us with a primary focus on building out our commercial infrastructure in the U.S. to support growing interest and demand for our technologies, especially Apollo ESG and REVISE. But that said, we are modulating spend in light of the changing environment. The more future focused initiatives are now a lower priority. We're setting a very high bar for these kind of investments. For example, we're taking a much more conservative view of investments in longer-term clinical and R&D pipeline initiatives that may not be necessary to support our core business today. While these are all elements that are ultimately critical for longer-term prospects, we have significant flexibility as to how much and when we fund these initiatives. So far in 2022, we've not made any long-term commitments to fund these types of initiatives. In fact, in the first half of 2022, we are well below our OpEx and CapEx spend plans while still on target with our revenue plan. Importantly, we have the ability to modulate spend as appropriate and we're well positioned from a balance sheet perspective to make these investments. With that on Slide 11, addressing our balance sheet in the fourth quarter of last year, we reinforced our balance sheet with $75 million in equity issuance and a new credit facility that will provide up to an additional $65 million in available capital over the next few years. At the end of Q2, we had $140 million in cash and committed cash, including $75 million in cash and equivalents and access to another $40 million over 2023 and '24 based on revenue milestones which are well below our base case expectations. We saw total cash use in the second quarter down by more than $2 million compared to the first quarter which is indicative of our disciplined use of capital even as we continue to make growth investments. We have a multiyear run rate at [indiscernible] our plan with an eye toward investments to take advantage of near-term opportunities in front of us. In terms of 2022 outlook, we expect to end the year with $125 million in cash and committed cash, including more than $60 million in cash and cash equivalents. This implies 2022 cash use of around $30 million which we anticipate is our high watermark for annual burn based upon our base case model. And that brings us to our medium-term business targets and commentary on our path to breakeven. Moving to Slide 12 -- as we've highlighted today in the past quarters, we have the OpEx and CapEx flexibility to greatly enhance our EBITDA and cash burn profile once we've built our organization to scale. And as you can see from the illustrative targets based upon our current base case model, we have a line of sight to positive EBITDA and cash flow breakeven business by the time we reach $150 million in annual revenue. We'll be in a position to make strategic decisions as to whether we enhance investment for accelerating top line growth or more future-focused noncore initiatives or to more aggressively position the company for profitability. But most importantly, based on our current base case model, we have the balance sheet and committed capital today to get us there. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chas for our business and strategic update. Chas McKhann : Thanks, Jeff. So in 2022, we have four overall strategic priorities. I'm going to spend the majority of our time today talking about the launch of Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE given our recent announcements. But before I do that, let me comment on the other three. First, around expanding our core GI defect closure and fixation business that's our OverStitch and our X-Tack products in that area. We've had a good quarter and good progress. Many of you know that in May, we had a very productive Digestive Disease Week meeting and that I think it included more than 100 different presentations about our products and that the X-Tack device was featured very prominently in that. And some of the first data that's come out on X-Tack after just one study that was published last year. And so building on that, we saw a 16% sequential growth in the quarter with X-Tack and we do anticipate that the awareness generated at DDW and that those presentations are then published and that will continue to help support continued interest and adoption of X-Tack. And then furthermore, that there are lots of opportunities still for OverStitch across a whole range of applications in defect closure and fixation. On Orbera, Orbera continues to perform well and has been a meaningful growth driver in our business for the last 18 months. We have successfully implemented co-marketing programs for Orbera in a number of our target accounts and MESA [ph] provided significant incremental growth for Orbera. And we also view these as essentially pilot programs where learnings from what's worked and what's been most successful can be applied to Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE and I'll come back to that. And we've also observed that Orbera has done particularly well in integrated practices that are offering a range of both Orbera, ESG and revision procedures. And we believe that has a sustainable element to it. And then on advancing the organization and Jeff already talked about this, right we are building the right capabilities that we think we need to really take advantage of these opportunities. We're doing it in a very targeted way. We're reviewing every addition in headcount, line item detail and only investing in the ones that we think are critical but we are making great progress in building our key capabilities in the organization. I am very pleased also to welcome Sharon O'Keefe to the Apollo Board of Directors which we announced just about a month ago. Sharon has extensive experience in leading large medical centers and for nine years served as the President of the University of Chicago Medical Center. She is a thoughtful, experienced healthcare executive and she will bring a new perspective to Apollo Board and we are very excited to have her. So moving now to the launch of Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE, first, let's start with the news that we've announced over the last month, two important milestones that literally have been years in the making. On July 12, Apollo received marketing authorization from the FDA for the Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE products it was via the de novo process. A couple of things to highlight 1 is the BMI range for the clearance of 30 to 50. That is a wide range and helps us allow us to treat potentially many, many patients who suffer from obesity. And so we're very pleased with that. Also, this de novo decision came even faster than we anticipated and we are very grateful to our reviewers at the FDA for their responsiveness and an interactive process throughout the process. And then on Thursday, just this past week, the MERIT study, a randomized controlled trial of ESG procedure was published in The Lancet. And I think the quote on the right side of the page which comes directly from the publication, is an excellent summary. For those who don't have the slides in front of you, I'll read it and the implications of all the available evidence. The MERIT study proves that ESG is scalable and can be offered in outpatient -- endoscopy practices by surgeons or gastroenterologists with an excellent safety profile without mortality and with predictable conservatively managed adverse events. And so the publication in Lancet is a big deal and one that we're very excited about. Many of you may know that recently, The Lancet was -- basically took over the leadership position as the highest impact factor journal in the world and so it's an honor to be published in it and all due credit to the investigators in the study. As you see on this page, there are some quotes from Dr. Abu Dayyeh [ph] from the Mayo Clinic and Dr. Wilson from UT in Houston really highlighting some of the overall benefits that were observed in the study and of the ESG procedure. Dr. Abu Dayyeh highlights not only the weight loss benefits but the study also highlighted meaningful improvements in comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and metabolic syndrome. And Dr. Wilson highlights the fact that we now have a safe, effective and durable procedure that can be performed by both GIs and surgeons. We are very grateful to both Dr. Abu Dayyeh and Dr. Wilson and the entire clinical investigator group who works on MERIT. This was not an easy study to complete. Most of it was performed during the height of the COVID pandemic just a few years ago and we congratulate them on their publication and we are very, very thankful for the work that went into it. So I'd like to take a step back and put into context now these two announcements. For more than two decades, engineers, researchers, venture capitalists have been working on developing new endoscopic approaches for weight loss. It's not an exaggeration to say that 100s of millions of dollars have been invested in pursuit of a less invasive, safe, effective and durable treatment for weight loss. And as you can see on Slide 18, ESG is the first and only procedure that fully delivers on this promise. Let me say a word about the Orbera intragastric balloon because it's an outstanding product and it continues to play a growing role in the treatment of weight loss. And Orbera's role is increasingly important in an integrated setting of care within an integrated endobariatric practice. But that being said, when you think about a full package of -- and the value proposition, only ESG offers what you see on the page. That being an FDA authorization in this case, for both primary and revision procedures, Level 1 evidence with the MERIT study in The Lancet, an endoscopic approach that same day, no incisions and with a fast recovery period, proven effectiveness with 49% excess body weight loss in MERIT. And 15% to 20% total body weight loss in a global published literature which by the way, now has more than 10,000 patients that have been studied in ESG procedures. A very good track record of safety with consistently around the 2% rate of adverse events, serious adverse events -- and as highlighted in The Lancet publication, these events typically can be managed very conservatively and in durability, two years in MERIT and up to five years in the published literature. And so again, that's why there's so much excitement now about the authorization and the study back-to-back. And physicians who've been working on this, as I said, for literally a decade or more, are incredibly excited by these two developments. So if anyone on the call isn't familiar with ESG, it is a suturing procedure in -- on the stomach, reducing the stomach volume as well as delaying gastric emptying which results in the benefits I just mentioned. We're going after and addressing a large patient population, more than 100 million people in the U.S. have a BMI over 30. But importantly, there are only about 200,000 primary bariatric procedures, traditional bariatric procedures performed in the U.S. each year. That result -- that translates, sorry, into a 0.2% treatment rate. We recently conducted market research with more than 1,100 people and confirm something that would seem intuitively pretty obvious. The biggest reason people don't consider bariatric surgeries is fear, fear of side effects, fear of complications. But the value proposition of ESG is fundamentally different. In the same survey we presented information about the ESG procedure and approximately 2/3 of patients are interested in the procedure and you can see the reasons why in terms of no surgical cuts, significant weight loss, durability. 57% would likely see a doctor to talk more about it. And the preference and overall participants expressed a clear preference for ESG over traditional surgeries. These surveys findings are consistent with the experience of physicians who are already early adopters. And what they tell us is that when patients are treated with both options, ESG or traditional surgeries, there is a true benefit for the ESG procedure. But furthermore and probably even more importantly, many patients who would not even consider a traditional surgery are now contacting these practices and wanting to learn more about ESG. And so with ESG, there's a substantial opportunity to grow the size of the pie of people who seek intervention. I'd like to directly address recent questions about the potential impact of weight loss medications on our endobariatric business. Recently, there have been important developments in new weight loss medications, including first semaglutide for Novo Nordisk which has the brand name of Wegovy as well as trazefetide from Eli Lilly which is currently only approved for diabetes but we do expect that in the coming months, it will be a clear for weight loss as well. These new medications are a substantial step-up compared to traditional weight loss drugs. And they are widely anticipated to become blockbusters. But as with any treatment, there are some downsides. The new drugs are expensive -- well more than $1,000 per month and they often are not covered by insurance. They can have tolerability issues and side effects. And we know from decades of experience, the compliance on long-term medication is often very challenging for patients. But again, we do expect them to have a major impact but recall the size of the problem. More than 100 million people and 40% of the adult population in the U.S. have a BMI over 30, having new treatment options, including these medications as well as ESG is a big step forward. And we also anticipate that the increased focus on obesity provided by companies like Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly will prompt many people to consider whether to take action and to evaluate their treatment options. And when they do, they're going to learn more about ESG as well. The potential of combination therapy of ESG plus one of these new medications is very exciting. The study shown on Slide 21 was presented at DDW 2021, so a little more than a year ago and was just recently published. It was a randomized controlled trial for one arm with CDSG [ph] and the second arm received a combination of ESG and a short course of semaglutide. The ESG arm alone performed very well with 18.7% total body weight loss. In combination, the total body weight loss was 25.2%. That's comparable to what is achieved typically with a traditional bariatric surgery without all of the downsides of undergoing a full surgical -- traditional surgical procedure. We are already aware of other physicians who are conducting similar studies of combination therapy for both ESG and revision procedures and so we'd expect to see more data in the future. And also, some of our customers are already incorporating GLP-1 medications into their treatment paradigms of patients who receive an ESG. Turning now to revision procedures, this also represents a big opportunity for us. Over a 10-year period, 1.4 million people in the U.S. underwent a primary bariatric surgery in the U.S. And over time, the body accommodates and studies have shown that up to 1/3 of people who receive a bariatric surgery may be candidates -- for a revision procedure. Traditionally, this has involved another invasive surgical procedure with all of the costs and risks associated with the primary procedure. But despite this, revision surgical procedures are the fastest-growing segment of the traditional laparoscopic surgical market. Now with the Apollo REVISE device, physicians will be able to alter the anatomy using a suturing technique and be able to regain many of the original benefits in an incision-less and typically same-day procedure. In a study published last year out of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, an endoscopic approach to revision procedures demonstrated similar effectiveness to a surgical procedures and this was studied by the way, up to five years but showed substantial improvements on adverse events and especially serious adverse events. So the potential value proposition is very clear. So turning now to Slide 23, so we've just recently received the FDA market authorizations but early adopting physicians have already started to embrace the procedures and prove their viability in real-world clinical settings. What you see on Slide 24, the top 10 private practices in the U.S. that are focused on endobariatrics and the top 10 academic centers where the majority or the entirety of their procedures are endobariatric. As you can see, the growth in these practices in the past 18 months has been substantial as both surgeons and GIs begin to incorporate endobariatric procedures into their clinical practice. The academic centers have grown by 28% in the last year. The private practices have grown their volumes by over -- by 60%. And furthermore, if you look at the average annualized sales across these 20 accounts in the first half of 2022, the annualized sales is about $600,000. As we look at this group, we see that there are numerous recipes for success, private practice and academic, surgeon or GI or a combination of both. Some are primarily cash pay. Some are using prior authorizations which I'll come back to as we talk about market access in a minute. So there are multiple potential models for success going forward. I will say replicating these successes will take some time. Many factors need to come together to create a successful practice, a skilled and well-trained physician. Staff who can provide excellent patient care both before and after the procedure and a practice infrastructure that is effective in identifying and managing patients in all of the key requirements for success. These 20 institutions and others like them in our key international markets already provide an excellent starting point and give us the confidence as we move forward. Slide 25 shows visual examples of some of the accounts that are already beginning to educate patients about endobariatric procedures, including ESG and revisions. These are publicly available screen shots from their websites but many of these practices are already using sophisticated marketing efforts using channels like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube as well as traditional radio and print ads. Through these collective efforts as well as co-marketing programs from Apollo, patients will be -- have an opportunity to learn and become increased awareness of ESG and endoscopic procedures and awareness and understanding will continue to grow. Slide 26 shows a summary of the different activities associated with our launch plans, including our marketing and medical education initiatives, training for physicians, readying our sales team and targeting them from a sales effort and then a range of reimbursement and market access initiatives -- that are ongoing. These activities are well underway and we do anticipate them contributing to our growth both later this year and into 2023 and beyond. Highlighting some of the key activities among our sales organization, one of the big changes that we've made is we've now added a new role into our sales team that we call regional endobariatric managers. This is a group that now complements our existing market development managers -- sorry, traditional sales reps. And the REM role really complements the traditional sales rep role by focusing on supporting new and emerging practices and that can incorporate Orbera ESG and revision procedures. And they're really focused on all of the different aspects of market development, of identifying patients, how to share best practices and helping grow and develop which is a different set of skill sets but one that's incredibly important in terms of how we will develop this over time. And then we're also enhancing our sales team effectiveness through enhanced training, customer relationship management and marketing support. Moving on to reimbursement and just market access, incredibly important to sustaining growth, importantly, we have already had existing models that are working as you see in the growth on the prior slide. Among the top 20 accounts, some exclusively use a cash pay model and their substantial growth is very good evidence of the high interest level and willingness to pay among patients. And we've been making channel checks with these accounts, especially in light of the broader macroeconomic environment and we continue to hear reports of strong interest and demand even in today's uncertain economic environment. Something we're watching closely but we're getting good feedback from the people who are talking to patients every single day. Other accounts also pursue prior authorizations with insurance companies for both ESG and revisions and often are getting coverage on a case-by-case basis. Achieving broader coding coverage and payment will take time. We have three primary areas of engagement, especially now with the both MERIT study and the FDA authorization and SAM [ph] first is the facility coding and payment. There are potential opportunities for new technology codes with Medicare and we will be pursuing those and we'll provide an update as we move forward. CPT codes are how physicians get paid and we are engaging the leading GI and surgical societies in the CPT coding process. Our objective is to have a successful Category 1 CPT code during the upcoming annual cycle which will result in a new Category 1 CPT code being effective January 1, 2025. But again, still work to do with the societies because I think we've mentioned this before, the AMA-CPT panel in the surgical and GI societies will really drive that process. And then thirdly engaging payers, coverage will build over time. As I mentioned, we already have seen success in some cases on a case-by-case basis. With the new market authorizations as well as with The Lancet publication, we will engage in efforts now to improve the coverage of both ESG and revisions. In the meantime, moving on to Slide 29 -- pardon me, we do still have a very viable cash pay model. And we just try to showing on this slide that it really is a win-win for both patients and physicians. Patients have very good treatment options that can be tailored to their needs with Orbera, with ESG or with revision procedures. And again, these can be in the context of both, a dedicated GI-based endobariatric practice or an integrated program that's offered by surgeons. For physicians, it is a chance to differentiate their practice, a chance to grow their practice and the practice economics can be very attractive as well. So in summary, with the recent market authorization and The Lancet publication, we are reiterating our medium-term growth outlook and adding a line of sight to cash flow positive business in the years ahead. And we are very excited about the impact that our products can have in improving patient care going forward. So with that, let me turn it back to Matthew and we'll open the call to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Chris Cooley from Stephens. Chris Cooley : Congratulations on the solid quarter just a couple of quick ones for me. First Chas, just curious if you could help us maybe look into your crystal ball. And as we think about in particular, the Lilly results, how do you see this affecting the market from a channel perspective. I guess, not only from a provider but also if we just think about the patient funnel, does this bring more patients into the patient funnel than over time, basically source from that for the surgical procedure? Does this -- I'm just kind of curious how you're thinking about that because in that study, the mean percentage weight loss was approximately 15% in six months. So just kind of curious how you think that may or may not play out? And then secondly, maybe just -- I'll ask both my questions upfront for Jeff. I appreciate the focus on achieving profitability on the hand the plan that you've outlined here on today's call? Just curious, though, if you've kind of changed your views on the rep adds. I think at DDW, you talked about getting upwards of 45 by calendar year-end. I noticed on Slide 27 and maybe this is just semantics, approximately 40 reps by year-end. I'm just curious if you're thinking about maybe modulating your headcount there a little bit. I know -- in your prepared remarks at the outset you talked about more closely evaluating incremental hires going forward, just trying to triangulate that a little bit as well? Chas McKhann : Appreciate it. So on the weight loss medications, both semaglutide and then the Lilly results with tirzepatide, I think we're all speculating a little bit in terms of conversations of how this will play out. But as we talk to physicians who again, are treating a lot of patients already, I think from a channel standpoint, it could play out at a couple of different time points. As I mentioned, I do think you're going to see more people who are overweight to obese are going to revisit should I do something, right? And you're going to have the weight of very large pharmaceutical companies talking about that. And someone will get medications but someone will also learn about their options overall. And we've already seen some examples of that our customers have. The second part that I did mention in my comments is patient compliance. Staying on a long-term injectable medication isn't easy. And we've just seen that across categories in -- for decades. So we absolutely expect they're going to have an impact, no question. But on a relative scale of the number of patients, right now, our fraction of procedures is such a small fraction of the overall market that the opportunity to get even some lift out of a net effect of increased interest and then some patients who try these medications and -- look for something more effective, we think actually creates some really good opportunities relative to our scale. Jeff? Jeff Black : Sure yes Chris, thank you. And to your question on headcount and OpEx modulation, I think it's a combination of two things. It's just being very critical about every dollar of spend and every head count that we add. But on the sales channel and on the commercial organization, it's really less about expense control, to be honest with you and more about the strategy around what is the right mix in the sales force, right. And so, we're really -- we're in many areas, we're really doubling down on this REM role and piloting some REM roles and how they best interplay with the sales reps. And so, that may differ on a geography by geography basis. We may have situations where a sales rep has a broader coverage territory because they have an REM to support them. We may have situations where because of geographic distance, we may have to add more sales reps to cover a more expansive geography and then supplement with more or less REMs. And so it's really more of a piloting around what's the right mix. And so it's less about, hey, let's say, five heads but let's get the mix right. Anything to add to that, Chas? Chas McKhann : No, I think you summarized it well. Chris Cooley : And if I could maybe just squeeze one other quick one in. I know during the first quarter, you received OverStitch. I'm sorry you received clearance in Japan for OverStitch. And we're going to -- obviously, you're working on timing and the dollar value there for reimbursement. Are there any new updates that you can provide at this time for the Japanese market and I'll get back in the queue? Chas McKhann : No, so we got the clearance in January -- sorry in Q1, you're right. We've still -- as you may well know, Chris, from other companies you cover, having the right distributor in Japan is critical and thinking long-term how you approach it. And so, we are actually still finalizing our distributor relationships in Japan which will end up impacting than what we expect on the growth trajectory. Operator : Your next question is coming from Adam Maeder from Piper Sandler. Simran Kaur : This is Simran on for Adam. Congrats on a great quarter and for the fulsome update on the business. So I know it's very early days but what impact, if any, have you seen on ESG and OverStitch volumes since the FDA approval of the labeling change for ESG and REVISE? And then maybe as a follow-up there, how do we think about the adoption over the remainder of 2022 and maybe even '23 in both existing endobariatric accounts and then now new accounts kind of coming into the funnel? Chas McKhann : Yes, no I appreciate the question. I think there'll be a time -- let me back up. The interest level following the authorizations and especially -- and then the publication last week has been extremely high. There's a lot of excitement. But there'll be a time lag from that to cases and people being treated, right? I mean if you think about the different elements I mentioned that come together through accelerating their practice, they take some time. And so, we do see that factoring into later in the year and then certainly, our momentum heading into 2023. And so that's kind of the timeframe and we would expect to see an impact of moving from, as I said, a lot of interest to a real impact. And then it's also been offset -- the announcements have just come in the last month. And as Jeff mentioned, we have seen some summer seasonality. And if any of you have traveled recently, airports are extremely busy, people are taking vacations. And we've seen that both with a number of our key customers. And so that's normal at this time of the year but I think maybe even a little bit more so this year. And that might cloud any immediate impact relative to putting the pieces together. We really are thinking about this for the long-term as well. One of the things I meant to mention in my upfront comments is speed is not our most important thing in this next phase quality is, right? We want to make sure we get very good customers getting excellent outcomes because that will result in the most long-term sustainable growth. Simran Kaur : Okay, perfect. And then -- maybe as my second question, can you expand on the international performance of the business? And I know both -- and Jeff had mentioned the FX headwinds. And even despite that, we saw pretty strong growth coming from that business. So maybe talk about some of the underlying trends offsetting that foreign currency dynamic and even the trends that you saw in the direct versus distributor channel? Chas McKhann : Sure no, happy to. Yes overall, we had a really good quarter outside the U.S. And the ESS business which is primarily OverStitch outside the U.S., we only have X-Tack in a few countries cleared. We reported 24% on a GAAP basis and 35% year-on-year growth so just good continued adoption of OverStitch. Most of our business outside the U.S. is for OverStitch is endobariatric but we are having a focus on also expanding core GI as well and the team is doing a nice job with that. Pretty good balanced growth between distributor and direct markets. And so, we're pleased with that. We also see good growth on the IGB side as well. We've had some share wins on -- we're much more competitive outside the U.S. and Orbera really does have a great track record of tried and true. And so we continue to do well there. So we had a nice balance in our business and are pleased with how the performance went again, despite the FX piece. And so, I don't over -- get too wrapped up in that it is what it is. The underlying fundamentals, we think, on the international side are very good. And then we are looking forward to X-Tack. No real changes on updates on that from an international CE mark. We're still working through the MDR processes for regulatory and that's probably a 2023 event like versus 2022. Jeff Black : And Simran, just to add to that, just to give a little more color when you see our international performance, what you're seeing is growth in predominantly existing geographies. So we really haven't done a lot of expansion into new geographies and are yet seeing growth in new geographies. So we're very encouraged by that because it is predominantly organic growth. Simran Kaur : Got it. And then, if I could squeeze one quick one in there. Maybe any update on the NASH strategy? I know Jeff, you were talking about modulating spend -- in your efforts to do that. Some of the more longer-term priorities are kind of being put on the back burner for now. So just what are your latest thoughts there any updates? Chas McKhann : Yes, I know that Jeff did allude to the fact that we really are focused on driving the core businesses. And we now are really looking at NASH as one of the key comorbidities associated with improvements in weight loss as well as things like diabetes and hypertension. And so, we're really trying to look at -- as part of the integrated strategy that's going to maximize the utilization of our products. And originally, the NASH strategy started with Orbera but we really are looking at it in the context of ESG as well and especially ESG now with the clearance. And so that is an area where we absolutely are doing a lot of homework working with thought leaders and hepatology community but also in the diabetology community and others to say which will have the greatest impact and therefore, what the clinical strategy would need to be. So it's one that we're not rushing into a new clinical trial right now, especially given the broader economic environment. Operator : Your next question is coming from Frank Takkinen, Lake Street Capital. Frank Takkinen : Congrats on the quarter and all the progress, I wanted to start off with reimbursement around ESG. More specifically, just if there's any opportunity and apologies if I missed it, around establishing a temporary C code for the outpatient setting a little bit quicker than some of those other time lines that you can start generating data and maybe start to see some partial or one-off reimbursement in the outpatient setting while you await final coverage in the multiyear process? Chas McKhann : Yes, no, it's an insightful question, Frank and it's one that our reimbursement team is working through as part of the overall facility payment side of things. So I mentioned things like new technology codes but you're right, C codes could be part of that strategy as well. And we're working through those details right now. Frank Takkinen : Okay, helpful. And then just back to the marketing authorization. My sense there was a couple last things to complete like developing some new SKUs specific to ESG and REVISE. One, can you provide an update on that? And then two, as it relates to that, can you talk to any potential pricing power for the weight loss indications and how that could impact gross margins over time? Chas McKhann : Sure, yes. So on the new -- there are new devices that were cleared the Apollo ESG and the Apollo REVISE devices. There is still some, frankly, kind of logistical elements that go into the packaging around those and being ready to ship that we would expect will still take a few months and probably be early in Q4 when we're shipping the new devices. And that just aligns with what we expected the original time line would have been unusually FDA beat us to it but we were more than happy. So we can still train physicians. We can still speak to the procedure but the actual SKUs being available will be a few months. And then we are also still finalizing the pricing strategy but we do expect they will be opportunity for some premium pricing that would help. But we're still working through the final pieces of that strategy because it will have long-term implications for things like reimbursement and others. And as we get further along, we'll provide an update on that. Frank Takkinen : Okay. And then just -- the second half of that, any comments on how it could impact gross margins over time? Chas McKhann : Well just that, I mean, the ability to have some pricing leverage would absolutely improve and help that and then as Jeff mentioned, the OverStitch and the components OverStitch are our primary focus areas of reducing costs as well. So we've factored that into kind of our overall plans of getting into the mid-60s on gross margin but we'll work that as part of the overall mix as we go forward. Operator : Your next question is coming from Matt Hewitt from Craig-Hallum. Matt Hewitt : Maybe first one and you touched on this a little bit in your prepared remarks but obviously, there was a ton of buzz around DDW for both OverStitch and X-Tack now that we're three months removed. I'm just curious, how has that kind of played out? Obviously, you've gotten the big approvals since then as well as the publication last week. So maybe it's difficult to pull those two pieces apart. But follow-through post DDW would be helpful? Chas McKhann : Yes, no, you're right, Matt. The interest level has been very high, increased awareness, especially for X-Tack as a new product and having podium presentations about it really for the first time in a big meeting just because it was one of the first really large in-person meetings has been exciting. And that has played well and helps support the 16% sequential growth that I mentioned. And so our sales team is very much focused on building on that momentum and continuing going forward. And we have a balance, right, of now needing to be able to do that while also focusing on the endobariatric side as well. So that will be an important thing that we're going to need to balance that is part of the rationale for the dedicated endobariatric manager roles. And so, we have a certain subset of our sales force that is 100% focused on the endobariatric side, while our reps are carrying the full bag. Matt Hewitt : Got it. And then maybe my second question, I think it was Slide 24, where you were talking about your top 10 private practice groups as well as your top 10 academic groups and the growth that they're seeing. I guess that was one of the things that came up at DDW was that some of your top accounts are figuring out ways to navigate the reimbursement with preauthorization? As they get more adopt at doing so until you've got more formal coverage in place, is that something that kind of a road map that your other accounts can follow, especially now that you've got the formal labels. But is that something where they can follow that road map and kind of get reimbursement kind of precharged even ahead of formal coverage? Chas McKhann : The short answer is yes, right. That is something -- that has -- what you heard in some of your conversations at DDW, people have been able to do that on a case-by-case basis really is some of the more sophisticated accounts who know how to do this, right and have been able to effectively navigate those conversations. And they've been doing that independent of Apollo. We didn't have the labeling. So, we didn't have a team in place supporting those kinds of efforts. With the labeling, we can implement a team that can help support that and, for example, share best practices. It can even vary by payer, right. Some payers will respond to certain things that really will make a difference in terms of whether a patient gets covered and learning that documenting it and helping people navigate it will be part of our strategy going forward. Operator : Your next question is coming from Jeff [ph] from Cowen. Unidentified Analyst : Chas, I wanted to just ask about the label for OverStitch ESG and just the BMI range of 30 to 50, how do you see your customer base and the future customers, physicians utilizing ESG and to BMI patients in between 40 and 50? Chas McKhann : I think it's a really interesting question of how it will play out. I think people, for the most part, currently assume that the sweet spot will be in the 30 to 40 range, i.e., the MERIT population and that's probably where we will start for the most part. But there were data presented at DDW, as you may recall, by one of our customers that showed very good results in patients with the BMI over 40. I think it was consistently a 20% or more total body weight loss. And that was independent of any medications. So one of the big speculative questions is whether combination therapies will really play a bigger role in that 40-plus range. And I certainly know some surgeons who think that it may well -- but I do think it will kind of go in that sequence. There still is a belief that ESG is typically a little bit lower on the efficacy side but a really good safety profile and a lot of patient benefits will probably start more of a sweet spot in that 30 to 40 range and then maybe migrate up over time. Unidentified Analyst : Great. I mean what will be sub utilization that may already be of ESG in patients as a preliminary procedure to make a patient a better candidate for maybe a surgical sleeve? Chas McKhann : We have seen people think about a kind of bridge to surgery approach at times as well. I'm not sure how common that is. I mean we certainly have heard it a bit more anecdotally. And could that play out over time, possibly. I mean one of the benefits of ESG as you aren't cutting off future treatment options. It's something that surgeons are very interested and know that they can do a sleeve in the future or do a bypass in the future if they choose to -- but I don't expect necessarily a bridge approach will be that widespread at least initially. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, okay. And then just wanted to ask about how your team is planning on marketing durability of the ESG -- I think MERIT after two years there other publications provide a signal durability to be less longer -- up to five years. How are you playing on marking them and just in the -- thinking about ESG revisions and how you see a path to potentially the potential for an ESG revision with an ESG procedure? Chas McKhann : Sure, yes. No, I appreciate the question. We have a lot of data out to two years. There was just a patient -- a study with 3,000 patients out of the Middle East with very good data out to three years and then there's limited data but some out to five years. So we're in that range. I think our experienced customers who've already been doing this in advance of us talking about it, are careful not to promise it as a panacea and really emphasize the importance of the patient follow-up and patient management in the programs that they do and if they -- how they engage in that can really impact the durability. But then, also, obesity is a chronic disease. And if people understand and expect that, then setting up the possible expectation that, yes, down the line, you need a retightening procedure. And we've got experience with that and good success with it. Or in the future, you may be a candidate for a surgical procedure. These are often part of the conversations and I think we'll be part of how we market it as well. Operator : Your next question is coming from Matthew Blackman from Stifel. Unidentified Analyst : This is Colin on for Matt, just one quick one for me today, first of all congratulations on the recent approval and the strong quarter. I had a question on the midterm growth target of 20%. Is that step-up largely ESG driven or do you also contemplate potential halo effect from ESG on the rest of the broader portfolio pull-through? Chas McKhann : Yes, no Colin, I appreciate that. As we've done our strategic plans, we like, as I mentioned on the call and what we've seen so far, a good balance across both products and geographies. And so I think there is a potential halo effect on -- from ESG and revisions on the balloon. And I mentioned that in terms of sustainable endobariatric practices. We do still continue to see very good traction and growth with X-Tack and that is before the CE mark. So that can be an important growth driver outside the U.S., or especially the economic value proposition of X-Tack is very -- it fits very well with the medical systems. But then having said all of that, I have said before, I think there is an opportunity, given the value proposition I mentioned for ESG to become a market-leading weight loss procedure -- that's not baked in -- I mean, that level of optimism isn't fully baked into that 20% number. I mean if we get to that, we'll be well ahead of that. Just a matter of how long does it take to really put all the pieces together and untapped the opportunity. But given what we're already seeing in people connecting the dots and having good success with growth, we're excited about it. So it's a little bit mix, very good opportunities with ESG and revisions but also balanced growth with other products as well. Operator : That concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the conference back to Chas McKhann for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Chas McKhann : Just want to reiterate our thanks to everybody for joining us today and we look forward to further updates as the year progresses. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Boston Scientific Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lauren Tengler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Lauren Tengler : Thank you, Andrew. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. With me on today\u2019s call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q3 2022 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today\u2019s call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials & Filings. The duration of this morning\u2019s call will be approximately one hour. Mike and Dan will provide comments on Q3 performance as well as the outlook for our business, including Q4 2022 and full year 2022 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith; and Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuation and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures, for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales. Relevant acquisitions include -- excluded for organic growth are Preventice, FARAPULSE and Lumenis Surgical, which closed in March, August and September of 2021, respectively; as well as Baylis Medical, which closed on February 14, 2022. Divestitures include the BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals, which closed on March 1, 2021. Guidance excludes the previously announced agreement to purchase the majority stake of M.I.Tech, which is expected to close by year-end 2022. For more information, please refer to our financial and operating highlights deck, which may be found on our Investor Relations website. On this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified, are organic. This call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, may, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new and anticipated product approvals and launches, acquisitions, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. If our underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect or if certain risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike Mahoney : Thanks, Lauren, and thank you, everyone, for joining us here today. We're very proud of our performance in the third quarter, particularly in light of the ongoing macroeconomic and supply chain headwinds. Our performance continues to be supported by the strength and diversification of our innovative portfolio and the winning spirit of our global team. Third quarter 2022 total company operational sales grew 14% versus prior year and organic sales grew 11.5%, which does exceed the high end of our guidance range of 8% to 10%. This performance is a testament to our category leadership strategy and focus on innovation with strong commercial execution. Six of eight of our business units grew double-digits organically and we believe that nearly all of our businesses and regions grew faster than their respective markets. Third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.43 grew 6.3% versus prior year at the low end of our guidance range of $0.43 to $0.45, attributable to increased FX headwinds and slightly higher spend within the quarter. We have grown 9.2% organically year-to-date through third quarter. And in light of this performance, we are increasing our full year 2022 guidance for operational growth to approximately 11.5% and organic growth to approximately 9%. For fourth quarter 2022 revenue, we're guiding to operational growth of 8.5% to 10.5% and organic growth of 7% to 9%. We're also updating our full year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance to $1.71 to $1.74, primarily related to the ongoing headwind from foreign exchange. Our fourth quarter 2022 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.45 to $0.48. Throughout 2022, we have maintained our goal to improve operating margins. While our goal remains, we feel it's prudent to provide an updated adjusted operating margin target of approximately 26% considering the continued macroeconomic pressures. On a full year basis, this does represent approximately 70 basis points of margin expansion versus our 2021 rate of 25.3%. I'll now provide additional third quarter highlights along with some comments on future outlook. Regionally, the US delivered operational growth of 12% versus prior year. Strong growth was realized across most all of our business units, particularly cardiovascular and endoscopy, and included an approximate 300 basis point tailwind from acquisitions. Middle East -- I'm sorry, Europe, Middle East, and Africa grew 15% on an operational basis versus prior year. We continue to see excellent execution fueled by our innovative portfolio with seven of the eight business units growing double-digits. Sales growth accelerated within our growth in emerging market countries within Europe, with notable strength across cardiology and peripheral interventions. In Asia-Pac, we grew 15% operationally with strong growth in China, India, and ASEAN countries. While our Japan results saw some impact from COVID within the quarter, we continue to see strength driven by new products, including POLARx, WATCHMAN, FLX and Rezum. Our team in China delivered excellent results in the third quarter with growth of 36%. Growth is primarily driven by our ICTx business within cardiovascular, PI and our CRM business units, supported by new and ongoing product launches across the portfolio. Turning to Latin America. The team executed another exceptional quarter, growing 29% operationally. All business units in major markets grew double-digits in the third quarter and across the portfolio. More than 10 new products were launched enabled by remote training and support. I'll now provide some thoughts on our business units, starting with Urology and Public Health, which grew organic sales 13% and 16% on an operational basis. The stone management, prosthetic urology, and prostate health franchises all grew double-digits in the third quarter, with balanced performance across the regions. We continue to focus on global expansion and are pleased to have received approval and commenced the launches of SpaceOAR in both Korea and Mexico and Rezum in Japan. Our Lumenis acquisition did turn organic in September and we remain excited about the global opportunity ahead with the Moses Laser Technology, LithoVue Single-Use Flexible Ureteroscopes, and our broad portfolio of stone management products. In Endoscopy, sales grew 10% organically. This category-leading business continues to focus on product innovations, enhanced by best-in-class physician education and training. Growth in the quarter was driven by our biliary and single-use imaging franchises with ongoing market development activities, enabling increased utilization of EXALT-D and other key products. In Neuromodulation, organic revenue grew 3%. Our pain franchise sales were flat year-over-year, below our expectations, with ongoing reimbursement challenges impacting US procedures for both Vertiflex and Spinal Cord Stimulation. In SCS, while international growth was very strong, with broad demand for WaveWriter Alpha, our US SCS sales were impacted by preauthorization denials despite strong patient demand and ongoing physician interest in our fast therapy. We have a team in place focused on supporting the preauthorization documentation requirements. However, we do anticipate that challenges will continue to persist in the fourth quarter. In Deep Brain Stimulation, the US, EMEA and LatAm regions grew double digits in the third quarter. Globally, we're seeing stable underlying DBS procedure growth, and we continue to see momentum in the US as we moved into full launch of our STIMVIEW XT integrated imaging and programming platforms. Cardiology delivered another excellent quarter, with organic sales growing 13% and operational sales growing 16%. Within cardiology, interventional cardiology therapies, organic sales grew 11%. This coronary therapies franchise performed well in third quarter, driven by strong performance in our international regions, particularly with our differentiated imaging franchise. Importantly, we recently completed enrollment in our AGENT IDE trial. This is the very first US trial for a coronary drug-coated balloon to treat in-stent restenosis. And we expect to launch in Japan in 2023, in the US in 2024. Our structural heart valves franchise did grow double digits in the third quarter again, with continued strength in Europe with our ACURATE neo2 TAVR platform. Additionally, results from the PROTECTED TAVR trial were presented as a late breaker at TCT. Recall the PROTECTED TAVR trial studied our cerebral embolic protection device, SENTINEL, with TAVR versus unprotected TAVR. With a reduction in the primary endpoint of overall stroke -- while the reduction in the primary endpoint of overall stroke did not reach statistical significance, a secondary analysis demonstrated a clinically meaningful 63% relative risk reduction in severe disabling stroke. Turning to WATCHMAN. Organic sales grew 26% in third quarter. Global growth continues to be very strong, further supported by the US FDA approval of an expanded label to include DAPT, giving physicians and patients choice of DAPT or OAC in the first 45 days post implant. We continue to focus on innovation in this space, with a Trusteer, which is our new steerable sheath and we also highlighted our next-generation FLX device, WATCHMAN FLX PRO at our TCT investor event in September. We expect FLX PRO to build on our second-generation FLX with additional sizes in the device coding designed to enhance healing. In Cardiac Rhythm Management, organic sales grew 7% versus prior year. We had another strong quarter of performance, as we continue to focus on lifetime patient management from diagnostics to implant with our broad portfolio. Within core CRM, our low-voltage franchise grew mid-single digits and high-voltage grew low single digits. Our diagnostics franchise continues to perform very well. We're pleased to have received CE Mark for our implantable cardiac monitor, LUX-Dx, and we have commenced our commercial launch. Electrophysiology sales grew 26% on an organic basis and 83% on an operational basis. We continue to see strength in our comprehensive international portfolio, which grew 45% organically. And this includes two months of contribution from FARAPULSE. Physician demand for POLARx in Japan and FARAPULSE and POLARx in Europe remains very strong, and we continue to see increased utilization at existing centers, while we are expanding into new accounts. In addition, we're pleased to have launched FARAPULSE in Australia and Singapore under special access, and we anticipate approval in 2023. The Baylis integration continues to go well with the differentiated Transseptal access portfolio growing double-digits in the quarter and remains on track to achieve our full year expectations. In Peripheral Interventions, organic sales grew 12% with broad growth across all major franchises and regions. In Arterial, our differentiated drug-eluting portfolio grew double-digits in the quarter and we received FDA approval for a line extension of ELUVIA and commenced launch of the longest length of drug eluting stent for peripheral arterial disease in the US. The Interventional Oncology business had another very strong quarter with great growth and continued strength in our cancer therapies, ICX and TheraSphere. We're pleased to have closed on the acquisition of Obsidio and the gel embolic material technology. Obsidio is the first gel embolic with an indication for the peripheral vasculature and a complementary addition to our portfolio. We look forward to launching this technology within the US in 2023. In alignment with our overall commitment to progress our environment, social and governance efforts, the PI division announced collaboration with a healthcare data platform, TruVida, aiming to provide insights to help better address healthcare disparities within various PI disease states. We remain committed to driving sustainable innovation to Boston Scientific. And despite the persistent macroeconomic pressures, we continue to invest for the long-term in R&D, execute strategic tuck-in M&A with a focus on improving patient outcomes today and into the future. We're also excited about the opportunities ahead and remain focused on our long-term financial goals, continuing to grow sales faster than the markets, operating margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EPS growth and strong adjusted free cash flow generation. Before I turn it over to Dan, I do want to take a moment to share that our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ian Meredith, will be retiring in April of 2023. We're extremely grateful for his strong contributions, particularly as dedication to patients, clinical science and meaningful innovation. And it's a great sense of humor. With that, I'll now turn things over to Dan to review our financial performance in more detail. Dan Brennan : Thanks, Mike. Third quarter consolidated revenue of $3,170 million, represents 8.1% reported revenue growth versus third quarter 2021 and reflects a $162 million headwind from foreign exchange, higher than our expectations due to the continued strength of the US dollar. Excluding this 550 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 13.7% in the quarter. Sales from the acquisitions of FARAPULSE through July, Lumenis through August and Baylis contributed 220 basis points resulting in 11.5% organic revenue growth, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of 8% to 10% growth versus 2021. Continued foreign exchange headwinds and slightly higher spend on R&D investment across the portfolio largely offset our top line outperformance, resulting in Q3 adjusted earnings per share of $0.43, achieving the low end of our guidance range, representing 6.3% growth versus 2021. Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 70.7% in line with our expectations. The macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging, particularly related to inflationary pressures and availability of materials, which have largely offset a slight improvement in freight costs. For full year 2022, we continue to expect adjusted gross margin to be slightly below 70.8%, which includes $375 million in macroeconomic headwinds versus 2019. These headwinds are predominantly from increased freight costs and unfavorable manufacturing variances, primarily related to direct material cost and availability with a smaller portion attributable to increased labor costs. Recall, unfavorable manufacturing variances are recognized over approximately six months, in line with our inventory turns. Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.5%, slightly lower than our expectations. We continue to focus on our global goal of operating margin expansion, but believe it is prudent to update our operating margin target to allow for the flexibility to weigh near-term spend discipline with investments to continue to fuel top line growth. We now expect full year adjusted operating margin to be approximately 26%. One-time charges within the quarter's results included a minor write-off related to the discontinuation of our SAVAL program. In addition, we recognized a GAAP charge attributable to an intangible asset impairment of $125 million primarily related to Vertiflex as the business continues to face reimbursement challenges impacting the revenue outlook for the product. On a GAAP basis, the third quarter operating margin was 11.3%. Moving to below the line. Adjusted interest and other expense totaled $91 million in Q3, higher than our expectations driven in part by FX losses from certain unhedged currencies. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 11.9% on an adjusted basis, including discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Excluding these items, our operational tax rate was 14%, in line with expectations. We ended Q3 with 1,440 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $626 million and free cash flow $320 million, with $470 million from operating activities less $150 million net capital expenditures. We now expect our full year 2022 adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $2 billion. Our total legal reserve as of September 30th was $304 million, a decrease of $210 million versus June 30th, primarily related to mesh and certain IP litigation payments. As of September 30, 2022, we had cash on hand of $338 million. Our top priority for capital allocation remains high quality tuck-in M&A and we'll continue to assess opportunities in conjunction with our financial goals. As of September 30th, our leverage was 2.5 times, and we now expect year-end leverage to be at or slightly below 2.5 times. I'll now walk through guidance for Q4 and the full year 2022. We expect full year 2022 operational revenue growth to be approximately 11.5% versus 2021, which excludes an approximate 500 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, 100 basis points higher than our previous expectations. Excluding a 250 basis point contribution from the acquisitions of Preventice, FARAPULSE, Lumenis and Baylis, and $13 million of pre-divestiture specialty pharmaceutical sales in 2021, we now expect full year 2022 organic revenue growth to be approximately 9% versus 2021, reflecting our strong Q4 performance and confidence in continued consistent procedural growth. We expect fourth quarter 2022 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 8.5% to 10.5% versus 2021, which excludes an approximate 650 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates. Excluding a 150 basis point contribution from the acquisition of Baylis, we expect fourth quarter 2022 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 7% to 9%. We continue to expect our full year 2022 adjusted below-the-line expenses to be approximately $350 million. Full year 2022 operational tax rate expectations remain unchanged at approximately 14%, with an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13%, including the benefit of the accounting standard for stock compensation and discrete tax items recognized year-to-date. Our tax rate expectations reflect current legislation, including a provision on the treatment of R&D expenditures. We continue to believe there's bipartisan support to reverse this provision. And if such legislation were to be enacted, we would expect our full year tax rate to revert to its historical range of approximately 11% operational and 10% adjusted. We expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,443 million shares for Q4 2022 and 1,440 million shares for the full year 2022. Our long-term hedging strategy continues to be effective at minimizing FX impact on EPS, and we are largely hedged through 2023. At current rates, we now anticipate FX headwinds on our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $0.06, which is $0.03 unfavorable versus previous expectations due to the continued strengthening of the US dollar. As a result, we are updating our full year adjusted earnings per share range to $1.71 to $1.74, representing 5% to 7% growth versus 2021. We expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.45 to $0.48. One quick housekeeping item before I turn it back over to Lauren. We continue to expect full year 2022 preferred stock dividend expense of approximately $55 million related to our May 2020 mandatory convertible preferred stock offering using the if-converted method. These shares will mature on June 1st, 2023, at which point the dividend expense will retire and our share count will increase based on our share price at the time of conversion. In each of the conversion scenarios, the resulting impact to EPS should be immaterial. For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q3 2022 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q3 results and the MCPS share conversion. In closing, I'm proud of the results we've achieved year-to-date with continued revenue momentum. And despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, we remain focused on operating margin expansion balanced with investment in our innovative portfolio to drive continued above-market top line growth. And with that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q& A. Lauren Tengler : Thank you, Dan. Andrew, let's open it up to questions for the next 35 minutes or so. [Operator Instructions] Andrew, please go ahead. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please, go ahead. Robbie Marcus : Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a great top line quarter. I'll also add congratulations to Dr. Meredith on a very well-deserved retirement. Maybe for my question, it really was a strong top line, double digits organic. Fourth quarter continues to look good in guidance. I think the one area where we've seen a little pressure is on margins. So, Dan, I was hoping you might be able to give us an early look into next year, how elevated is the spending. There's a lot of moving pieces with OpEx and currency and the share count. Do you think the Street's generally in a decent spot for next year with returning to more normalized margin expansion, or do you think it's still going to be a pressured year in 2023? Thanks. Dan Brennan : Sure, Robbie. I think, obviously, early to comment on 2023 specifically. But I think I can probably give you some commentary that would be helpful. First, you mentioned share count. That shouldn't really be a driving factor, because I mentioned on the conversion of the MCPS, that, that shouldn't really impact next year's EPS once converted. Let me look at Q3 first, though. If you look at EPS for the quarter, given the reported revenue at the high end of the range, it's probably reasonable to expect that we would have been at the high end of the EPS range, which was $0.43 to $0.45. We achieved $0.43, which is $0.02 lower than the 45. $0.01 of that is from the incremental FX headwind and $0.01 is from lower operating income percentage versus expectations in the quarter. I think the FX impact, I think, is well understood, given the strengthening of the US dollar, so not a lot of additional commentary there. Relative to our operating income percentage, the goal is to be 26% for the full year. And this involves balancing certain initiatives to reduce expenses in the short term to offset the supply chain and inflation headwinds, while at the same time, continuing to fuel our top line, which has been performing very well. If you look at the P&L components of a 26% adjusted margin scenario in 2022, it would likely have gross margin higher than 2021, SG&A lower than 2021 and R&D slightly higher than 2021. And we think this is appropriate. And keep in mind, as Mike said, this would be 70 basis points higher than the 2021 adjusted operating income margin full year of 25.3% and in line with the 2021 second half and importantly, in line with 2019 full year while absorbing $375 million of supply chain and inflation headwinds compared to 2019. So I feel very good about how we're balancing that and looking at that 26% as a very successful number for the year. Specific to 2023, again, our goal is always to continue to increase operating margin, long-standing goal of doing that 50 basis points per year. If you look at the 25.3 last year, we'll be 70 basis points, as I said, advanced on that in 2022 if we hit that 26. And then even with where we were in 2019 and the second half. So more to come as we evolve and deliver guidance likely in that February timeframe, but I feel good where we are in 2022 and look forward to continuing the journey in 2023 and beyond. Robbie Marcus : Great. Appreciate the color. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please, go ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about Neuromodulation. Mike, could you talk a little bit more about the reimbursement challenges there? What channels are you seeing that in? And it seems like all your businesses are consistently growing around the corporate growth rate except Neuromodulation. So what's the plan to accelerate the growth in that business? And let me just also extend my congratulations to Dr. Meredith, and I wholeheartedly agree with your comments earlier, especially about his sense of humor. Thanks for taking the questions. Mike Mahoney : Larry, yes, we're quite proud of the performance nearly every business grew double-digits and faster than the peer group and every region as well. You saw the growth in Europe and China all over. So we're quite proud of the results in the quarter and really through the year. Neuromod, they're really broken down in two pieces. The deep brain stimulation franchise is doing extremely well, growing strong double-digits, US, Europe, and a nice pipeline. And we're not seeing really some of the macro headwinds in the DBS business. On the spinal cord stimulation business, as you know, this market has been tough to call. Really over the past few years during the pandemic. And now as we're essentially hopefully getting out of the pandemic. The markets, we think, in the low single-digits to potentially mid-single-digit range now. So it has come down a bit in terms of the overall market growth rate, we believe. What's hurting the market, not necessarily Boston Scientific as you've seen some competitive results already, and you've seen this trend throughout the year, has been in the spinal cord stimulation market in the US. And we're seeing more preauthorization denials in the US. We are seeing strong patient funnels. So our team is essentially really focused on building additional capabilities to help our physician customers manage those preauthorization trials. These patients need the products. The products obviously work. I think it's more of an industry challenge right now. And we're working with them to streamline that authorization process to get patients through the funnel and position to get paid. So we do anticipate that headwind will persist in fourth quarter. Hopefully, it will get better in 2023. Us, like our competitors, will have easy comps in 2023 based on this so that helps mathematically. But fundamentally, we need to improve the -- help our patients and customers with this preauthorization hiccups and some of the capabilities we're building into the system with that. But I think it's more a class issue right now than a Boston Scientific issue. Larry Biegelsen : Thank you so much. Operator : The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Sorry, Thank you very much for taking the questions. Can we spend a little bit of time on WATCHMAN franchise? You've had over the last 12 months, increased competition but an improved label and sort of broader geographic reach. Can you pick apart how those segments are going or how those headwinds and maybe not headwinds are impacting the franchise? Thanks. Mike Mahoney : Sure. The WATCHMAN business had a terrific quarter. It grew 26%. The bulk of that growth coming from the US. We have launched recently in Japan, albeit a bit slower given the COVID situation there and the need for more proctoring, but that should have a bigger impact for us in 2023. Similar results in China, I would say same commentary. A bit slower out of the gate given some of the COVID restrictions, but should get better in 2023. We've also continued to gain share in Europe, which I think is important. But by far, the most important market is the US and the team there has done an excellent job. It's really a comment similar to previous calls. You did call out the DAPT label. That did have some additional momentum for us in third quarter as some physicians, kind of, converted back to WATCHMAN FLX now that we've had that label. And really, it's the consistent ease of use, the safety benefits, and the support that the implanting cardiologist or EP is receiving from the refer. The referring community is getting more and more confident in WATCHMAN, in particular, each quarter. And so we expect the market to continue to be quite healthy. We're calling it roughly 30% growth. We're investing in the clinical trials that you're aware of with option and champion to further widen the market opportunity for it. And we have a very strong pipeline of new products coming behind what is already differentiated from our competitor WATCHMAN FLX product. So, we think we're in a really good position here and we're going to continue to grow the market and invest to have this be one of our top growth drivers. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Dan, maybe 1 for you on the financial side here. I think the 26% operating margin for the year, that would imply Q4, the pretty steep ramp in Q4. Are we thinking about margins the right way? And when you think about those margins, what should FX impact be for next year at current rates? Anything to think about balance sheet inventories, which have been capitalized that flowing through the P&L for next year, any impact for 2022? Thank you. Dan Brennan : Relative to -- say that again, Vijay? Vijay Kumar : I meant the inventory impact for 2023, sorry. Not 2022. Dan Brennan : Yes, right, got that. Specific to Q4, so your math is right, right? We're 25.5% year-to-date adjusted operating margin. So it implies a 27.5% for the fourth quarter to get to the full year 26%. We believe we have the plans in place to do that. There's a bit of a seasonality that helps if you look back over the past few years, Q4 is usually the highest margin quarter we have, both gross and operating. So, we're looking for that trend to continue here in Q4. So -- but yes, it requires a strong Q4, but we believe we have the plans in place to deliver that. Specific to 2023, I probably can be a little bit helpful on that. I think somewhat unique to us in our hedging program, we do hedge out multiple years in that program. So, as I mentioned in my commentary, we are largely hedged for 2023. So, if rates were to stay where they are today, I think you'd likely see an impact in 2023 of pretty similar to what you see this year on earnings per share. Recall, at the operating margin percentage level, you don't see much benefit from FX. You see that in the gross margin. But then because our -- the majority of our OpEx dollars are dollar-denominated, you lose that in the OpEx section of the P&L. So, the operating margin contribution from FX is very minor. So, not much to talk about there. But relative to EPS impact, I would say, likely similar to what you see this year, assuming rates remain constant. Vijay Kumar : Thanks guys. Dan Brennan : Thanks Vijay Operator : The next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Travis Steed : Hey for the question. Also congrats to Ian Meredith. So I might have missed it earlier, but can you remind us again the moving parts on what drove the higher OpEx and the lower op margin guide for 2022 versus three months ago? Just as a quick clarification. And then the question I was going to ask was more on the Analyst Day last year. You were committed to a double-digit EPS growth CAGR. This year, you're closer to 7%. Is that double-digit EPS CAGR still good? And in the starting point for 2023 and still be in that double-digit range, given the macro pressures that we're in? Dan Brennan : Yes, on the double-digit earnings per share, that's always been our growth goal, and we've achieved that many years. The issue this year is a change in tax legislation that went into effect in January. And that is about $0.06 overall for the year. So if that were the old legislation, we'd be solidly double digits. It's a provision on the amortization of R&D within tax. And so, that's really the kind of the stick and the spokes of getting to double digits this year. Double digit remains our goal going forward as we talked about at Investor Day. And then your first question was...? Mike Mahoney : I'll just comment. There's a lot of focus on with AdvaMed society and others on advocating for that R&D amortization to reverse. So that is a one-timer that will annualize in 2023. And if you neutralize that and some of the FX were strong double digits for the year. Travis Steed : That\u2019s helpful. And if you could just remind us the moving parts on the 2022 margin guide, exactly what the higher OpEx and what drove the change in op margin again. I may have missed that earlier. Dan Brennan : Yes, it's really. It's really just a balance within the P&L. So if you think of where we are versus 2021, you'll see higher gross margin, you'll see lower SG&A and you'll see slightly higher R&D. So we're balancing the P&L to try and offset the $375 million of headwinds that we have versus 2019. And just maintaining the appropriate level of spend in that R&D line to continue to fuel the top line. So that's really the only tweak within there. So making sure that we fuel the top line, while still trying to offset the supply chain and inflationary headwinds. Travis Steed : Great. And congrats on another good top line. Dan Brennan : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Cecilia Furlong with Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead. Cecilia Furlong : Great. Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Just wanted to ask a bit more color on what you saw exiting September versus July and August across your portfolio. And then, looking at the 4Q guide, if you could just walk through your expectations, either US, OUS, what you're looking at for China. And then just expected either seasonality. Any impact from deductibles. Anything you would call out specifically that you incorporated in the 4Q guide. And thanks for taking the question. Dan Brennan : Yes. I don't think we're going to get into the specifics of the quarter. I mean, we're -- I think the revenue results stand on their own. We're super proud of the 11.5% organic growth in the quarter. So I think that speaks for itself. Relative to Q4, obviously, we're giving guidance today. We know where we are through October through -- where we are in October. And Neuromod, as Mike said, Neuromod is probably a bit challenged in Q4 versus what we might have expected 90 days ago. But the rest of the business has tremendous momentum. And again, super proud of the 11.5% that we delivered in Q3, again, with most of those businesses in double digits. Mike Mahoney : Yes. You asked about the regions. You saw the US performance in third quarter and for the full year is quite strong, but also a particular strength in Europe and Asia-Pac. And our China business grew over 30% in the quarter. It's done extremely well this year based on the diversification of the portfolio and the product launches. And really the innovation of the team in China. And also shout out to the European team in a very mature market, continues to grow double-digits in the kind of Western more established markets and very strong double-digits in the emerging markets there. So, you're seeing really balanced growth across each region throughout the year. And many of those products, as I mentioned in the script, in Europe, particularly in EP, we're working on clinical trials to get these products through and improved in the US. Cecilia Furlong : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Mike Mahoney : You are welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead. Rick Wise : Hi Mike, hi Dan. Two questions. Maybe just on the recovery, just one large picture and one product question. On the recovery, I'm very -- obviously, FX is a notable factor that's going to continue. But I'm curious to what extent are some of the other macro headwinds stabilizing or even improving particularly staffing. I keep saying myself if staffing were less of an issue, maybe you would have grown even more rapidly. Is staffing still an issue? Are things stabilizing in general on the freight and cost side are getting worse? And then I have a product follow-up question. Mike Mahoney : Sure. On the hospital staffing, you've seen some of the big public companies, hospital change report. Maybe it's gotten incrementally better, but certainly still quite a challenge for hospitals. Despite that, the procedure volumes are quite healthy. Despite some of the staffing shortages, could they be a little bit better. If the shortage were improved likely. But they're doing a nice job of managing it. And it's forcing us to be innovative with them on reducing procedure times, which we continue to do, find ways through our portfolio. So, staffing may be slightly better, but still a very tough environment for hospitals. It might provide some upside over time as that gets better, but it's going to get better, more slowly, not overnight. And the other headwinds we talked about I think the $375 million-ish of incremental supply chain, bucketed supply chain costs versus 2019. And the biggest -- we are seeing some slight improvement in some of the freight areas, and we expect some slight improvements ongoing there in 2023. The bigger bucket that's most impactful is the product cost. The material cost, the supplies and raw materials that we purchase. And due to some of the shortages there we have tied up some longer term contracts to ensure supply, but those have come at more hefty price increases. So that bucket, we don't see getting better in 2023. So, we think we'll carry that forward in 2023 as you annualize those contracts. Some of the other areas will get more efficient the productivity of our manufacturing plants and so forth. So, as Dan mentioned, we expect to carry many of the supply chain headwinds primarily for material cost into our 2023 plans. But similar to this year, we did improve margins 70 bps versus 2021. Our goal will be to continue to improve margins in 2023 and manage through that. Rick Wise : That's great, Mike. And just -- it's hard to resist asking about FARAPULSE. It sounds like things are going extremely well. Can you talk about drivers of the demand for FARAPULSE in Europe, maybe any incremental color on centers opened? And just maybe update us, remind us if everything is still on track for data -- US data readout in 2023 and approval in 2024? Thank you again. Mike Mahoney : Thanks, Rick. I'll have Dr. Stein cover that one. Ken Stein : Yes, sure, thanks, Mike, and thanks, Rick, for the question. We're very pleased with the commercial rollout in Europe to date, both in terms of continued procedure growth at the centers where we have opened and being able to open new centers as we continue the product launch. And I think that the drivers are really, what we've always said is the promise of the FARAPULSE technology, right? It's enhanced safety as compared to thermal ablation, it's proving to be at least as efficacious, if not more effective. And certainly, as Mike mentioned in terms of the issue with headwinds with staffing, it's a much more efficient procedure and really just couldn't be happier with what we're seeing in terms of outcomes in Europe to date. We have completed enrollment in our US IDE trial that was the ADVENT trial, and again, still on track to finish follow-up for the primary endpoint of that data in, sort of, midterm next year and then submit to the FDA and then it's all in the hands of the regulators. Rick Wise : Thank you, very much. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. Please, go ahead. Matthew O'Brien: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And let me offer my congratulations to Dr. Meredith as well on his retirement. Mike, it seems like you're taking a little bit of near-term pain right now to continue your spending in these growth areas, because you continue to be one of the faster growth, diversified med tech names out there. So I'm just curious, if you feel like that momentum is going to continue into 2023, where you can stay one of the faster growth, large-cap med tech names out there. And if it's going to be more of a broad-based level of improvement across all the different franchises where you can keep kind of growing in this double-digit range in some areas, or if it's going to be a little bit more focal than what we've seen historically. I don't know if it's specifically in cardiology or other areas. Thank you. Mike Mahoney : Sure. What you've seen in the performance this year is pretty consistent across all of our divisions, six of eight grew double digits in the quarter. And you've seen similar performance throughout the year because of the innovation and commercial teams that we have. And our -- each quarter, as we mentioned many times, the lower growth markets, the mix of those businesses get smaller each quarter and we layer on M&A and new innovation to grow faster. So that's kind of our formula, and it's proven to work pretty well. As we look in some of the decisions that we make, we're very excited about the portfolio of significant launches that we have. Most of the significant -- very significant, move the needle launches are more in the 2024, 2025 period, and that's where you're seeing the great growth in Europe, whether it be our ACURATE neo valve, the Agent balloon that we're excited about, which we think will change really the script in coronary and that will launch next year in Japan. And as Dr. Stein just mentioned, our EP portfolio with FARAPULSE and cryo is doing exceptionally well outside the US, and we have other launches. So that does require quite a bit of R&D and clinical work. We'll be starting a persistent trial with FARAPULSE in the coming months here. So we think our R&D spend is appropriate to fuel that consistent above peer market growth over the LRP. In 2023, we'll give guidance in February. We will have a bit tougher comps in 2023 based on the performance of the estimated 9% growth this year. But if you look at -- we're excited what 2023 will bring, and we'll give more guidance there. But if you look at the company, and what we have for the future based on what we're seeing in Europe and the clinical science that we're delivering, whether it be in our Interventional Oncology business or EP business, we're quite confident in the next LRP that will consistently grow above peer group. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Matt Taylor : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay? Dan Brennan : Yes, hear you fine Matt. Matt Taylor : Thanks Dan. Okay, so I wanted to circle back and just ask 1 about Q4. Just on the 7% to 9% organic versus the 11% plus that you did this quarter. Obviously, the comp is tougher. But is there anything else you call out there? Are you seeing anything slow down? Are you being conservative? Any highlights on just kind of the delta quarter-over-quarter? Dan Brennan : I think it's really just the comp, which is the better part of 250 basis points more difficult. And Neuromod is lower than the average of the rest of the businesses. But as we've continued to say, six of eight double-digits in Q3, continued momentum with a lot of the good new product launches we have, both in the US and internationally. So, I think the business has great momentum. And I think once you clear for the comp, it's a great Q4. And if we delivered 9% organic revenue growth for the full year versus 2021, I think that will be a great year for the company. Matt Taylor : Great. Can I ask 1 follow-up? I just wanted to know, we heard more about pent-up demand signs from some of the other peers that have reported. Would you found that -- are you seeing signs of that start to come due? And how do you square that, I guess, with staffing getting slightly better? What are the things that, I guess, could release over the next couple of quarters to help with the volumes? Dan Brennan : We think the volume is pretty good. And there is certainly pent-up demand, but it's been in the system for a while. You look at your typical backlog, whether it be a knee replacement or a Afib product or whatever, a men's health implant. Oftentimes, you're getting a 60 to 120-day wait in the US. And so there's certainly pent-up demand. But I don't see that getting cured in the near-term. I think there's just a very strong patient demand. There is a bit of a staffing shortage -- there's only so many labs that a hospital has to do procedures. And so we see pretty strong volume, which I guess is a good sign for the future here despite some of the staffing shortages and just hospitals extremely busy, lab time very busy and demand that outstrips their supply in many cases that drive the waitlist. But we don't see that waitlist dramatically changing in the coming months. Matt Taylor : Thanks Mike, thanks Dan. Operator : The next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Pito Chickering : Hey good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Now, it's been a while since the last COVID spike. Have you seen the funnel for patients to get procedures normalize across your product portfolio versus pre COVID levels? Are you seeing any bottlenecks within that funnel as you think about your organic growth? And just to be clear, this isn't about necessarily nurse staffing and hospitals, but all the touch points across health care systems. Mike Mahoney : Yes, I think -- thank you. I think it's similar to the last response. It depends on the region of the world. We did see a slowdown in third quarter in Japan. And you see pockets in China and sometimes pockets all over the world depending on what happens with COVID. But overall, that's been smoothed out with the underlying pretty good procedure growth and us doing a bit better. And so again, I think as you look to fourth quarter and 2023 here, staffing shortage still is an issue. It's not going to be resolved in 2023. Hospitals are being very innovative to try to shore that up. But a strong patient demand, common to see longer wait list. So, we do see pretty consistent demand, but we don't see a quick fix for the staffing shortage. But the underlying demand still strong despite that. Pito Chickering : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Pasquale with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Chris Pasquale : I wanted to follow up on the increased prior of denials in Neuromod. You talked about helping physicians with documentation, but what about addressing the underlying payer reticence to allow access to those therapies? Do you think more clinical data can help? And what had you had planned on that front? Mike Mahoney : I'm really much more to comment on. The team does quite a bit with our clinical studies that we do for product approvals. It's a well-accepted therapy across -- it's been -- it's a pretty mature market in terms of number of competitors and clinical science that's actually increased quite a bit the last few years. Part of it is the payers. We certainly work with our hema teams to contact those payers directly and reemphasize that clinical evidence. But it's really a bit of just some of the recent preauthorization denials that just need to be worked through in terms of their efficiency. And we aim to improve that process. Chris Pasquale : Got you. Okay. Mike Mahoney : I don't think it's related to any -- it's not related -- the slowdown is not related to any poor clinical data. There's good clinical data at Boston Scientific and our peer group and it's well established by the implanter, whether it be a pain physician or an orthopedic physician. It's well proven out. I think it's working through some of the mechanics of these preauthorization denials is the issue. But I also think overall, the market is a bit slower, even excluding that than it was historically. Chris Pasquale : And then renal innovation is going to be a hot topic at AHA. Boston had a program there at one time with Vasix [ph]. How are you thinking about the potential of that therapy and Boston's ability to participate there as it does become a new growth driver in cardiology? Mike Mahoney : Dr. Meredith, take that one. Ian Meredith : Yes, thanks, Chris. It's a good question. Yes, we will see Medtronic hypertension study come out of AHA, and we just saw the RADIANCE II trial results come out the TCT with Ultrasound. This is a real therapy, and hypertension is an enormous cardiovascular problem globally, and we follow this space very carefully. This is a significant opportunity. Obviously, the results still could be improved. If you look, there's significant variability in the treated arm effect. And that probably reflects that we've got more to do to understand in whom we should be using this form of therapy. But it's a real opportunity. Hypertension is a massive cardiovascular problem. We follow the field very closely. It's one that we have to pay attention to. Chris Pasquale : Thanks, and congrats, Dr. Meredith. Ian Meredith : Thank you. Operator : And I understand there is time for one last question, and that would be from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Please go ahead. Matt Miksic : Hey thanks so much for squeezing me in. Mike Mahoney : Good morning Matt. Matt Miksic : Hey how are you? So, congrats on a really strong quarter, and Dr. Meredith, we'll certainly miss your insights and your cheerful disposition. And I guess I'm thankful to that we've got about six months to get to know this humorous side that everyone is referring to. So, I look forward to that. Just one follow-up, if I could, on margins. Dan, you talked about the impact of FX, and it seems like that explains pretty much the $0.03 reduction in EPS guide for the year. Just maybe one question on trajectory. It's such a strong Q3 here. You're adjusting Q4 for EPS and top end of the range for organic growth. That strikes me as a little bit conservative just given the strength, but I love your comment on that. And then maybe you're not talking much about 2023, but the shape of margins. I know there's been a lot of questions around how far into 2023 some of the higher costs will go. And if we were to think about -- is this sort of a front half, back half that we should be thinking about for 2023 at this point. Or I'm sure it's too early to say, but any insight you can give on how we should think about costs as they roll through inventory and P&L and so on? Thanks so much. Dan Brennan : Sure, Matt. A lot to chew on in that question. So, the -- first, I agree with your assertion. The $1.71 to $1.74 from the $1.74 to $1.77 adjusted earnings per share guidance for the year, that is FX. That's down $0.03. FX is the FX impact on EPS was $0.03, it is now $0.06. So that is the difference for the $1.71 to $1.74 change in guidance. On the revenue for Q4, your comment that it appears conservative. I think it's appropriate. I think we've looked at all the different variables that are there, the momentum in the business and we think that the guidance we gave is appropriate. And I think for 2023, I think it's just a bit early. I mean I gave you a little bit of a teaser there on FX, given where we are with our hedging program. But I think other than that -- and obviously, that our goal is to continue to expand operating margin over time. But other than that, I'll probably just let you wait until we give guidance officially on all the specifics. But super excited about how the company has performed this year and look forward to continuing that trend in 2023 and beyond. Lauren Tengler : All right. Thank you for joining us today.

All participants will be in listen only mode [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Lauren Tengler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Lauren Tengler : Thank you, Drew. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q4 and full year '22 results, which includes reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials and Filings. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike and Dan will provide comments on Q4 and full year performance as well as the outlook for our business, including 2023 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ian Meredith and Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures and for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales. Relevant acquisitions excluded for organic growth or Preventice, FARAPULSE and Lumenis Surgical, which closed in March, August and September of 2021, respectively, as well as Baylis Medical, which closed on February 14, 2022. Divestitures include the BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals business, which closed on March 1, 2021. Guidance excludes the previously announced agreements to purchase a majority stake in M.I. Tech and Aquatech as well as the acquisition of Apollo Endosurgery, which are all expected to close in the first half of 2023.

Mike Mahoney : Thanks, Lauren, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. 2022 represented a return to more durable and consistent procedural growth within the markets we serve, which provided a stronger base for our innovative portfolio. I'm very proud of the resiliency and winning spirit of our global team, delivering on our sales and EPS goals despite the ongoing macroeconomic and supply chain challenges. Importantly, we delivered strong performance across all geographic regions and believe that most all of our business units gained or maintained market share throughout the year. In fourth quarter '22, total company operational sales grew 9% and organic sales grew 7% versus fourth quarter '21, which was the low end of the guidance range. However, it's very important to note that these results include an unplanned sales reserve of $60 million, established for an Italian government payback provision which resulted in a headwind of approximately 200 basis points for the quarter. The underlying fourth quarter performance was strong on both sales; operating margin increases and earnings per share. And without the impact of the Italian sales reserve, we would have achieved the high end of our organic sales guidance range of 7% to 9%. Full year '22 operational sales grew 11% versus '21, while organic sales grew 9%, in line with our guidance of approximately 9%. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.45 declined minus 2% versus '21, and full year adjusted EPS of $1.71 grew 5% versus '21, both achieved in the low end of the guidance range. Once again, without the impact of the Italian sales reserve, we would achieve the high end of the guidance range for both fourth quarter and full year of $1.71 to $1.74. We generated full year free cash flow of $950 million and adjusted free cash flow of $2.1 billion, in line with our expectations. Now for outlook for 2023. We are guiding to organic growth of 6% to 8% for both first quarter '23 and full year '23, which excludes the acquisition of Apollo Endosurgery and the majority stake investments in M.I. Tech and all of which are expected to close in the first half of 2023. Our first quarter '23 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.42 to $0.44, and we expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $1.86 to $1.93. And despite the ongoing macroeconomic pressures and supply chain headwinds, we remain committed to our goal of plus 50 basis points of operating margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth in 2023. Dan will provide more details on our '22 performance, the Italian sales reserve and our '23 outlook. I'll now provide some additional highlights on '22 results along with comments on our '23 outlook. Regionally, on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 10% versus fourth quarter '21. Full year '22 grew 11%, inclusive of a 300 basis point tailwind from acquisitions, with particular strength in our WATCHMAN, Endo and urology business units. Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 11% on an operational basis versus fourth quarter '21 and 12% on a full year basis. This above-market growth was supported by ongoing investments in emerging markets, new and ongoing product launches across the portfolio, pricing discipline and strong commercial execution.  We're excited about the year ahead with ongoing momentum across the region, particularly with our innovative EP portfolio and further opportunity with Baylis in the Access Solutions franchise. Asia Pacific grew 10% operationally versus fourth quarter '21 and 12% for the full year. On a full year basis, six out of eight business units grew double digits, supported by ongoing innovation across the region. Full year Japan growth was driven by new products, including POLARx, which has approximately 50% share in open accounts. We look forward to 2023 with ongoing momentum from both new products and are excited about our recent approval and reimbursement received for AGENT DCB, which is a coronary drug-coated balloon for restenosis in small vessels. On a full year basis, China grew more than 20%, fueled by 13 new product launches, ongoing portfolio diversification and the team's resiliency and execution. We continue to expand our presence in the China market with the recently announced acquisition of a majority stake in Acotec. We believe this investment can create strategic value for both companies with opportunities to collaborate in R&D, manufacturing and commercial strategies. We also continue to expect China to be a double-digit grower in '23 despite ongoing VBP pressure and potential impact to procedure volumes in Q1 from COVID. In Latin America, the momentum continued with operational sales growth of 16% versus fourth quarter '21 and full year growth of 28%, with all business units growing double digits versus '21. On the business units, starting with urology. Urology sales grew 12%, both operationally and organically versus fourth quarter '21 and on a full year basis. They grew 15% operationally and 10% organically versus '21. Within the quarter, all franchises grew double digits, fueled by new and ongoing product launches and continued global expansion. On a full year basis, global growth was driven by key products such as LithoVue, Rezum and SpaceOAR as well as the acquisition of the Lumenis Moser laser technology, further complementing the urology portfolio. Endoscopy sales grew 7% organically in the quarter, and on a full year basis grew 8% organically versus '21. In '22, we had global success with innovative products such as AXIOS and Single-Use imaging, both growing over 20% and supporting strong growth across the globe. In the fourth quarter, we announced our intent to acquire Apollo Endosurgery, which will add a complementary and innovative endoluminal surgery portfolio. We look forward to closing this acquisition as well as our previously announced majority stake in M.I. Tech, which includes the innovative stent in the first half of '23. Neuromodulation sales grew 5% organically versus fourth quarter '21 and on a full year basis grew 3% organically versus '21. Globally, our spinal cord stimulation business grew 4% in the fourth quarter with continued physician enthusiasm for WaveWriter Alpha and FAST. We continue to invest in clinical evidence to expand indications and present three-month data from our nonsurgical back study, SOLIS, at NANS earlier this year.  The study comparing SCS to conventional medical management met its primary endpoints, and we anticipate FDA approval for nonsurgical back indication by the end of '23. Our Brain franchise grew double digits in the quarter and low double digits on a full year basis. This strong performance is aided by continued momentum from new product launches in '22 as well as the recent launch of the Vercise 2-in-1 lead extension. Peripheral Intervention sales grew 9% organically versus both fourth quarter '21 and full year '21. Within Arterial, we are pleased with the performance of our drug-eluting portfolio growing strong double digits for the full year and achieving the number one global position -- I'm sorry, the number one position within SFA in the U.S. On a full year basis, our venous franchise was flat versus prior year with Varithena, our market-leading varicose vein offering, growing over 20% in 2022. Our Interventional Oncology franchise performed well in '22, growing low double digits, led by our portfolio of innovative cancer therapies and suite of embolization tools. We continue to invest in expanding the potential applications of TheraSphere and enrolled our first patient in our early feasibility study, frontier the image of -- safety of image-guided intra-arterial delivery of TheraSphere GBM in patients with the reoccurring glioblastoma. Cardiology delivered another excellent quarter, with operational sales growing 13% and organic sales growing 10% versus fourth quarter '21. On a full year basis, sales grew 14% operationally and 10% organically. Our newly aligned cardiology group delivered strong growth across its four businesses, as we continue to invest in the higher growth segments and differentiated offerings for our customers that address the areas of greatest cardiac need for patients. Within Cardiology, Interventional Cardiology Therapy sales grew 5% organically in fourth quarter and on a full year basis grew 8% organically versus '21. On a full year basis, the Coronary Therapies' franchise, which includes both drug-eluting stents and complex PCI grew 7%, driven by strong performance in our international regions and our imaging franchise. Our structural Heart Valves franchise grew double digits in both fourth quarter and the full year basis, outpacing the market in Europe with our ACURATE neo2 aortic valve. Ongoing clinical evidence to support growth throughout '22 and in the fourth quarter. Data from the ACURATE neo2 PMCF study was presented as a late breaker at PCR London Valves, demonstrating positive safety and 30-day outcomes with low PVL rates and best-in-class pacemaker implantation rates. Additionally, we enrolled our first patient in the ACURATE Prime XL Nested Registry, assessing the safety and efficacy of the ACURATE Prime Aortic Valve XL to treat patients with severe aortic restenosis who need a larger valve size for the TAVR procedure. WATCHMAN sales grew 22% organically versus fourth quarter '21 and on a full year basis grew 24% organically versus '21. Q4 finished with record sales, strong utilization in the U.S. supported by the DAPT label expansion. Importantly, we completed the enrollment of our CHAMPION-AF trial way ahead of schedule. This head-to-head trial versus novel oral anticoagulation has the potential to more than triple the number of patients indicated for WATCHMAN FLEX in 2027 and beyond. We remain excited about this outlook for this business and expect double-digit growth in 2023, fueled by innovation, ongoing clinical evidence and strong commercial execution. CRM sales grew 6%, both operationally and organically versus fourth quarter '21 and on a full year basis grew 8% operationally and 7% organically. Our Diagnostics franchise had a strong year, growing double digits versus '21. In core CRM, on the full year basis, our high-voltage business grew low single digits, and our low voltage business grew mid-single digits, and we expect that all major markets were in line or slightly above the market. Electrophysiology sales grew 76% operationally and 25% organically versus fourth quarter '21 and on a full year basis grew 69% operationally and 18% organically versus '21. Importantly, our international EP business continues to outpace the market, growing over 40% organically versus fourth quarter '21. POLARx continues to perform well in both Europe and Japan has now been treated to treat over patients since launch. Momentum in FARAPULSE continues with another strong quarter of growth in Europe. And we continue to invest in clinical evidence and look forward to the readout of the randomized ADVENT U.S. IDE trial in the second half of '23 and are planning to initiate our ADVANTAGE AF trial these therapods patients with persistent AFib imminently. We've been very pleased with the performance of our Baylis acquisition and the innovative platform, which grew 2 times faster than the market in '22. We launched our VersaCross Connect in '22, improving efficiencies in our WATCHMAN procedure. Earlier this year, we shared our strategy consistent with years past. We continue to position ourselves to win in the markets we play through meaningful innovation by balancing our financial commitments. And in '22, we announced four acquisitions, invested 10% of our sales in internal R&D to fund sustainable growth and advance patient care. We're extremely excited about the year ahead and remain focused on our people and sustaining a culture that is motivated to drive differentiated performance and achieve our long-term goals, continuing to grow sales faster than markets, continuing to expand operating margins and delivering double-digit adjusted EPS growth and strong adjusted free cash flow generation. So, before I turn it over to Dan, I want to share that with the retirement of Dr. Ian Meredith, Dr. Ken Stein will assume some of the global responsibilities that previously fell under Ian, including total company investor engagement, in addition to a CRM, EP and WATCHMAN roles. Please join me in congratulating Ken, and thank Ian for his many contributions. With that, I'll pass it off to Dan to provide more details on the financials. Dan Brennan : Thanks, Mike. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue of $3.242 billion represents a 3.7% reported revenue growth versus the fourth quarter 2021 and reflects a $158 million headwind from foreign exchange, slightly favorable to our expectations as the U.S. dollar weakened throughout the quarter. Excluding this 500 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 8.7% in the quarter. Sales from the acquisition of Baylis contributed 160 basis points resulting in 7.1% organic revenue growth at the low end of our guidance range of 7% to 9% growth versus 2021, including an approximate 200 basis point impact associated with an unplanned sales reserve related to an Italian government payback provision, which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022. With the goal of recovering spending above the government's medical device budgets, this payback provision requires companies that have supplied medical devices to public hospitals in Italy to pay back a portion of these overrun amounts. While we and others in our industry, have appealed and will continue to challenge the enforceability of the law through the Italian court system. We established a sales reserve of $60 million in the fourth quarter, representing our best estimates of amounts we could be required to pay back. Without the reserve, we would have achieved the high end of the organic revenue growth guidance range. Flow-through on the Italian sales reserve resulted in Q4 adjusted earnings per share of $0.45, at the low end of our range, representing a decline of 2% versus 2021. Without the reserve, we would have achieved the high end of our range for the quarter. Full year 2022 consolidated revenue of $12.682 billion represents 6.7% reported revenue growth versus full year 2021 and reflects a $524 million headwind from foreign exchange. Excluding this 440 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 11.1% for the year. Sales from closed acquisitions contributed 240 basis points, resulting in 8.7% organic revenue growth, in line with expectations and inclusive of a 50 basis point impact associated with the Italian sales reserve. Full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $1.71 represents 4.8% growth versus 2021, achieving the low end of our guidance range of $1.71 to $1.74. Without the unplanned Italian sales reserve, we would have been at the high end of our full year guidance range. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 70.5%, resulting in full year 2022 adjusted gross margin also of 70.5%, in line with our expectations. Full year adjusted gross margin improved versus 2021, driven by an FX tailwind of approximately 100 basis points related to our hedging contracts, partially offset by continued macroeconomic headwinds. These headwinds were approximately $375 million versus 2019 and are predominantly from increased freight costs and unfavorable manufacturing variances primarily related to direct material cost and availability. Our 2023 guidance assumes macroeconomic and supply chain headwinds will be similar to 2022. Different from prior years, we expect first half 2023 gross margin to be higher than the second half, largely due to the timing of foreign exchange movements that occurred during 2022. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.7% resulting in full year 2022 adjusted operating margin of 25.6%, improving 30 basis points versus 2021, inclusive of a 30 basis point negative impact from the unplanned Italian sales reserve. As we look to 2023, we continue to focus on our goal of annual operating margin expansion. And despite our expectation of continued macroeconomic headwinds, our goal is to achieve approximately 26.4% adjusted operating margin for the full year 2023, representing 80 basis points of improvement versus the 2022 adjusted operating margin of 25.6% and importantly, 50 basis points of expansion compared to the full year 2022 adjusted operating margin without the impact of the Italian sales reserve. On a GAAP basis, the fourth quarter operating margin was 12.4%, including $131 million in litigation-related expenses, which I'll provide detail on in a moment. Moving to below the line. Fourth quarter adjusted interest and other expense totaled $88 million, resulting in full year adjusted interest and other expense of $362 million, slightly higher than our expectations, driven in part by an FX loss from certain unhedged currencies. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 11.9% and 12.7% for the full year 2022 and including discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Our operational tax rate was 12% for the fourth quarter and 13.5% for the full year, slightly favorable to our expectations of approximately 14%. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1.442 billion in Q4 and 1.440 billion for the full year 2022. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $776 million, and free cash flow was $597 million with $807 million from operating activities less $210 million of net capital expenditures. Full year 2022 adjusted free cash flow was $2.1 billion, in line with expectations, and free cash flow was $949 million with $1.5 billion from operating activities less $576 million of net capital expenditures. For 2023, we expect adjusted free cash flow in excess of $2.3 billion. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash on hand of $928 million. We continue to expect to close the acquisition of Apollo Endosurgery and the majority stake investments in M.I. Tech and Acotec with cash on hand or available credit lines in the first half of 2023. Our top priority for capital allocation remains high-quality tuck-in M&A, and we'll continue to assess opportunities in conjunction with our financial goals. As of December 31, our leverage was 2.57 times, in line with our expectations, and we were pleased to be upgraded to BBB+ with a stable outlook at both Fitch and Standard & Poor's within the quarter. Our legal reserve was $443 million as of December 31, an increase of $139 million from the prior quarter, primarily related to our mesh litigation. While our U.S. case count has remained materially the same over the past three years, we've increased our reserve to account for our latest estimates of the time and cost to resolve these claims as well as remaining probable and estimable global claims. I'll now walk through guidance for Q1 and the full year 2023. And as a reminder, guidance excludes any acquisitions that have not yet closed. We expect full year 2023 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 5% to 7% versus 2022. Excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, based on current rates, and a 20 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full year 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 6% to 8% versus 2022. We expect first quarter 2023 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 3% to 5% versus Q1 2022. Excluding an approximate 350 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates and a 70 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect first quarter 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 6% to 8%. We expect our full year 2023 adjusted below the line expenses to be approximately $340 million. Under current legislation and forecasted geographic mix of sales, we forecast a full year 2023 operational tax rate of approximately 14%, with an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13% including the benefit of the accounting for stock compensation, which we expect will largely be recognized in the first quarter, resulting in a Q1 2023 adjusted tax rate of approximately 12%. We expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.447 billion shares for Q1 2023 and 1.464 billion shares for full year 2023, which includes the shares we expect to issue on June 1 this year related to our May 2020 mandatory convertible preferred stock offering. We expect the impact to adjusted earnings per share to be neutral with the preferred stock dividend ending at the time of conversion. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.86 to $1.93, representing 9% to 13% growth versus 2022. At current rates and existing hedging contracts, we anticipate a neutral impact from FX on full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share. We expect first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.42 to $0.44. For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2022 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q4 results and 2023 guidance. In closing, I'm very proud of the results that our global team achieved in 2022 with top-tier revenue performance and differentiated operating margin expansion despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, and I'm looking forward to continued momentum during 2023. With that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A. Lauren Tengler : Thanks, Dan. Drew, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. In order for us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Drew, please go ahead. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead. Rick Wise : Good morning everybody. Great to see another excellent year from Boston Scientific. I guess to focus on one question, I'll start with your 2023 guidance. Obviously, the 6% to 8% guide is right in line with your long-term philosophy. But you started in the same place in '22. You obviously, excluding the Italy issue, finished above 9% organically. Why again stick with the to 8%? Is this conservatism, respect for lingering macro pressures or both? And maybe just as part of that, why model macro headwinds similar to '22? The large-cap companies reporting to date, they're not Boston Scientific, but they're all in some way, shape or form highlighting the improving or less pressures from macro as they finish the year and start '23? Thank you very much. Mike Mahoney : Good morning, Rick. It's Mike. Thanks for the compliments. Just to summarize your points, I guess. We're really happy with fourth quarter. Excluding that onetime Italy reserve grew plus 9%, basically high end of sales, high end of EPS. And as Dan said, really pleased that delivered top-tier revenue growth and I think one of the few companies that actually improved margins as well in '22. So, we have a lot of momentum and we're excited, very bullish on '23 in the future here. On guidance, you don't win the day in February here. So we think the 6% to 8% guidance for full year is appropriate. For the full year, we're coming off a 9% growth comp in 2022. And we obviously plan to grow as fast as we possibly can we continue to invest in the company. There are a couple of things that will be in -- there are pluses and minus. We're very bullish on the EP business, our momentum with WATCHMAN with There's a couple of headwinds. We do believe on the CRM side. We grew about 6% or 7%, I guess, last year, 7% in a market that's low single digits when you include diagnostics.  So, we expect a little bit of a headwind there based on comps China performed terrific for us in '22, and we expect them to deliver, again, excellent double-digit growth but potentially not quite as fast as they did in '22. Also, the underlying markets we compete at about 6%. So, we think coming off a 9% comp, 6% to 8% full year estimate. This time of year, is the smart prudent guidance to give, and we're going to push to beat it. Dan Brennan : And then relative to the macroeconomic environment, Rick, the -- we kind of reiterated that 375 that we saw in 2022 as being a similar headwind in 2023. As you saw through 2022, we have a pretty high-performing global supply chain organization that has been on top of this all through it, and which is the reason that we've been giving the updates at the level of specs specificity that we have. So, as you would imagine, as we went through our annual operating plan process and guidance preparation process, they really dug in at a detailed level to try and understand what 2023 could bring. There are some elements that look better, right? Freight does work better. You see fuel prices and oil prices coming down. So, we're optimistic freight costs will be less. The supply of materials and the cost of materials is still a bit uncertain and choppy and that direct labor piece that we had that in 2022, you've got to annualize that in 2023. So, I think the prudent case right here, the prudent course for guidance in February is to assume that we don't get a lot of macroeconomic help in 2023, I'd love to be surprised as we go through the year that we get that help. But I think as we sit here in February, prudent to assume a similar headwind to what we saw last year. Rick Wise : Thank you so much. Operator : The next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Robbie Marcus : Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe to start, Mike, at our conference last month, you were really bullish on FARAPULSE, and we saw EP have a nice beat in the quarter, particularly outside the U.S., where you have FARAPULSE and POLARx going now. Maybe you could talk about your expectations what you saw in the quarter for FARAPULSE specifically and your expectations for it in 2023, especially after we get the data later in the back half of the year, assuming it looks good? Mike Mahoney : Sure. Yes, our EP business in the quarter grew 25% and it grew 40 or 50, I think... Lauren Tengler : 40% internationally. Mike Mahoney : 40% internationally and poorly in the U.S. because we don't have these products approved in the U.S. So that really drove the growth down to 25. But I really look at the -- outside the U.S. growth as the key barometer for us. And we're continuing to see great pickup with both our cryo platform and FARAPULSE. Cryo is a platform that is competing against a product that hasn't changed in a decade. And so, physicians like the ease of use and the features of the cryo platform that we have in Japan and in Europe. So that's doing quite well, and we're hopeful to have approval for that second half of '23 in the U.S. here. And then FARAPULSE is doing extremely well for both cryo users who have adopted FARAPULSE and point to point RF users, Dr. Stein is on the phone, so he can make some comments. But the utilization enthusiasm for FARAPULSE is extremely high, and we're very bullish as we look at 2023 in terms of our EP performance and outlook, especially in Europe and Japan. And if we can get some -- the approval of the cryo platform in the second half, the U.S. will perform quite well as well. And then we expect to see a big impact from FARAPULSE in '24. So, the future of our EP business is very bright. We know it's a competitive field.  We believe we have unique platforms in both FARAPULSE and cryo that are differentiated and showing that clinically where they're launched and we have an excellent commercial team ready to bring these to the U.S. So, we don't give specific guidance for EP, but it's clearly a critical growth driver for us 23 and well beyond that. Dr. Stein, if you have any other comments? Ken Stein : Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Robbie. Again, just we do believe that FARAPULSE is differentiated relative to other PFA technologies out there. I think it's important to reiterate that all PSA is not created equal and because it's a field effect, the results that you're going to see with any of the technologies are highly dependent the way actual catheter design and FARAPULSE is the only system in evaluation right now that was designed from the ground up to deliver PFA dependent on the waveform that's delivered and dependent on the dosing strategy. And as you said, we are really looking forward to presenting the results of our randomized FARAPULSE trial, ADVENT in the second half of this year as well as to initiate our persistent AF trial advantage imminently. The only thing I'd add to what Mike said is I also think as you think about I think it's really important also to consider the really extraordinary momentum that we've got with our Transseptal access solutions from Baylis and continue to see above-market growth with that and continue to see increased use of the bales Transseptal access solutions, the energy needle and versus across access, both in ablation procedures and in WATCHMAN and other structural heart procedures. Robbie Marcus : Great. Thanks. And maybe just a quick follow-up. China has been an important growth driver for Boston Scientific, grew 22% in the year even with the difficult operating environment. So how should we be thinking about China coming out of the reopening here into first quarter? And what's your expectation for the year going forward? Thanks. Mike Mahoney : Thank you. That team had a terrific '22 despite all the challenges with COVID and all the different pricing tenders that occur over there. So, for China, in '23, we are very bullish again -- we do expect double-digit growth out of the China team for the full year. There'll likely be some pressure in first quarter given the challenges that they've had in China with COVID. So, we expect potentially some sales growth challenges in Q1, but we do expect strong double digit for the full year, likely not at the same level as the 22% that we delivered in '22, but strong double digits nonetheless. Operator : The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on a strong end to the year here. I wanted to ask a two-part question also on FARAPULSE. So maybe for Dr. Stein, you talked about your excitement for the ADVENT trial later this year. Can you help put the data into context? How did that compare to prior RF and cryo studies? And what would be a win for you in ADVENT for FARAPULSE? And we're going to see -- the second part is we're going to see the Medtronic Pulse select data at ACC, the J&J INSPIRE data at Boston AF, I guess, this weekend. You talked about how FARAPULSE is differentiated. What should we be looking for in those studies that would support your comments earlier? Thank for taking my question. Ken Stein : Yes. Thanks, Larry. And let me just sort of begin by reiterating what I said to Robbie here. As we look at the data, everyone just needs to bear in mind that every PFA technology really needs to be evaluated on its own. It's very much unlike RF ablation. When you're doing RF ablation, if you've got the same size catheter tip and you've got the same back patch and the same power that you're putting through, you get the same lesion. PFA is very different. Again, because it's an electric field effect, what happens is just intimately related to actually the catheter design that tells you the shape of the field that you're generating; the waveform, which tells you very much what kind of impact you're going to have from that field and then your dosing strategy, how many applications of energy do you put in and where do you put them in. We're very confident that FARAPULSE is the industry leader in this. Again, based on having a catheter that was designed from the ground up to deliver PFA, based on a decade of preclinical and then really high-quality clinical data, validating the waveform and validating a dosing strategy with ReMAP studies that creates durable isolation. And I say, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and we're really excited and looking forward to seeing the results of our randomized ADVENT trial. I'm glad that you mentioned MANIFEST, again, gives us a high degree of confidence in where we're going, right? So, MANIFEST is a registry study of the earliest commercial cases following our CE Mark approval in Europe. So, this is people's first experience climbing the learning curve and is reported out published initially on the first 1,700 cases and then some limited follow-up in about 1,400 of those patients. And really what those data show really proves the advantages of using a system like FARAPULSE. Certainly, 1,700 patients, the safety promise of FARAPULSE was realized. No cases of esophageal injury, no cases of persistent phrenic nerve injury, no cases of pulmonary vein stenosis, so certainly being able to avoid most feared complications of AF ablation. Seeing efficacy results that for paroxysmal AFib are at least as good as what's reported in high-quality trials with conventional thermal ablation and seeing remarkable procedure efficiency. Now -- in commercial clinical use, now sort of routinely seeing these cases being done on the order of 30 minutes. And that kind of procedural efficiency is, it's good for the system as a whole, right? There are a lot of patients who need to be treated dealing with staffing issues, et cetera, et cetera. Anything we can do an increased throughput is good. It's good for patients, though, too. The less time you're undergoing a procedure, the less number of things that can go wrong, honestly. And so basically, to some, right, the MANIFEST data validates what we see as all the differentiated advantages of FARAPULSE, a safer procedure avoiding the worst complications. A procedure that is at least as effective as what you see with thermal ablation and a really efficient procedure, which benefits physicians, hospitals and patients. Larry Biegelsen : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you very much for taking the question. And good morning. I want to spend just a minute or two on the Urology and Pelvic Prolapse business. I mean, that was up another 12% this quarter, 12.7% organically last quarter. What is driving that? And should we think of this more as a solid double-digit grower as we look forward?  And my follow-up question, I'm going to just put it out there now, 50 basis points of operating margin expansion or at least 50 basis points this year, where is that coming from? Thank you. Mike Mahoney : Great, Mike here. Thanks for asking the endo, uro. You didn't asked about endo, but I'll throw it in there because they continue just to really outperform and are getting quite sizable within our portfolio and both accretive nicely to margins and growth rate. The urology results, I mentioned in the prepared words, it's a strong global performance around the world. This business has been predominantly a U.S.-oriented business that grows faster in the U.S. accretive to Boston Scientific. Outside the U.S. has been very underpenetrated. But now with all the investments that we've made, commercial and through R&D and through acquisitions is strengthening our outside the U.S. business in urology extensively. And the combination of that global performance and I would say, a highly differentiated portfolio. We talked about category leadership within a service line, and we really have that with urology and with endoscopy. So they have a very differentiated portfolio that's very comprehensive versus our competitive set and contracting capabilities with customers who want to work with us. And so urology continues to do quite well, and we expect similar results over the next few years here. And the integration of Lumenis has done well. So that's a terrific business. And I would say, along the same lines, most of the same words with endoscopy as well. In terms of margin improvement, Dan, do you want to hit that one? Dan Brennan : I can do that. Yes, so the commentary again was 50 basis points on top of the 2022 results, excluding the Italian sales reserve. So that would be more like 25.6% was the actual, and then there was a 30 basis point impact. So then add 50 basis points to that is where you get the 26.4 just to give you the math there. And where does it come from? The short answer is, we believe all lines of the P&L. So gross margin will have a slight headwind from FX this year. Again, we said neutral to the EPS line, neutral to adjusted EPS for the year. But at the gross margin line, we're largely hedged for the year 2023. And with what we see with where rates are today, we think we'll have a slight headwind from FX in gross margin. But we still think gross margin itself can go north through a lot of the good activities that we have from our global supply chain team in terms of reducing cost and other volume improvement programs. And then tightly managing our discretionary spend within SG&A to ensure it's helping us achieve our strategic plan. And as we've always talked about, just really focused on R&D efficiencies and leverage. It all starts with a healthy top line. We think that 6% to 8% guidance versus that 9% comp last year is a good, solid, healthy top line, and that gives us leverage opportunities throughout the whole P&L. And we think each line of the P&L has the opportunity to contribute towards the goal in 2023. Operator : The next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Thanks for taking my question. Just some cleanup questions here on the guidance assumptions. Mike, the 6% to 8% organic, it is what it is, but can you just remind us what are the incremental tailwinds -- positive tailwinds here in '23 and any incremental headwinds versus '22? Some things I can think of FARAPULSE becomes organic, maybe China has a little bit of a headwind, but can you just go through some of those drivers? And again, on share count up 20 million, that seems are just given how we've seen share count progress throughout the year. Curious why -- what's behind the share count assumption for the year? Dan Brennan : Yes, sure. On the share count, just to take that clean up quickly and then Mike can take your revenue question. It's just a simple math of the converts that we have in -- during the year. So the increase is from the share count that will increase when we convert the mandatory preferreds. Recall, we then lose the preferred dividend. So it's neutral to EPS, but the share count increases as those preferred holders will get common shares. That makes sense, Vijay? Vijay Kumar : That's helpful. Yes. Dan Brennan : Yes. So I mean the takeaway should be neutral EPS impact from share count related to the mandatory preferred conversion this year. Mike Mahoney : Sure. And the headwinds and tailwinds, maybe just some of the headwinds : we like the fact we did 9% growth in '22, but that's a bit of a tighter tougher comp than normal. So that's one.  I had mentioned China would be expect double-digit growth, but likely not the same growth as '22. And then also CRM coming off of a really exceedingly market growth quite a bit in '22, likely to grow more in line with the market in '23. So there's a couple of the headwinds, clearly, a bunch of tailwinds. The company performed -- continues to perform extremely well across the globe, Europe, LatAm, Asia-Pac and U.S. You saw really impressive growth across the company. WATCHMAN growing 24% for the year, Cardiology as a whole grouping grow 10%, PI grew 9%, Endo 8%, Euro 10%. So we have just very strong momentum across the businesses, which is obviously a bit of a tailwind given the momentum we have commercially. And we have incrementally to that some of the questions today on EP. We expect to have a very strong year in EP in outside in Europe and in Japan. Potential tailwind would be depending on when cryo gets approved in the U.S. So I'm sure how much of an impact that will have in the U.S. depends on the approval date there. Other products like WATCHMAN continue to do extremely well. We're really proud. We actually think we gained share in fourth quarter with WATCHMAN and ended the year just over 90% market share. So that business continues to do really well. And the one that gets very little discussion by analysts, but lots internally and by physicians is ACURATE neo2. We now have a large size. That business is doing extremely well in Europe, actually building momentum each quarter. And we're anxious to finish that U.S. trial shortly. Vijay Kumar : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : The next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Travis Steed : Hi, good morning, everybody. And thanks for taking my question. I guess I'll ask a question on the Italy impact. Just curious why we're only hearing about this from Boston. I don't know if maybe it's -- you're taking a more conservative approach in taking a reserve. And it seems like a big number. I know it seems like Italy wouldn't be that big of a country, so maybe just calculated on more than a year of sales. And I just want to confirm no impact on 2023? And then I'll ask my follow-up now as well, which is on op margins. I think you mentioned gross margin first half higher, lower in the second half on currency. And I just want to make sure there's any puts and takes to consider on the op margin side first half versus second half? Thank you. Dan Brennan : Sure, Travis. I'll take the Italy one first. I can't speak for other companies. I can speak for on behalf of Boston Scientific. It's been an evolving situation, particularly over the last few weeks here, because what you have is the Italian government passed a provision back in 2015 with regard to what I mentioned to trying to claw back some excess spending over the allocated budgets within the public hospitals in Italy. But for the last 7-plus years, there's really been -- it's been dormant. There's been limited implementation guidance, there's really been literally no activity around that. That changed, again, over the last few weeks, with some events that put a little more teeth into their desire to collect those monies. And so we booked that incremental reserve. We had a reserve on the books, we booked an incremental reserve to cover what we believe will be the amounts that we'll owe as part of that. We're obviously challenging it vehemently through the Italian court system as our other industry participants, we disagree with it. But that outcome will be uncertain, but we picked a reserve that we think is a reasonable reserve given the timeframe. Mike Mahoney : He also mentioned do you see an issue in '23 with more reserves? Dan Brennan : The '23 amounts are included in guidance. So the amount of the reserve relates to prior periods, 2015 to 2022, anything that's 2023 and beyond is included in guidance. With respect to op margin, actually, I'm glad you asked that question because it's a bit of a juxtaposition with gross margin. So I mentioned that gross margin will be higher in the first half and lower in the second half, which is a bit of a buck the trend we normally have, which I wanted to make sure I got that point out there. Relative to operating margin, though, I think you'll see a similar trend where it builds throughout the year. So the gross margin higher in the first half, lower in the second half, but through the rest of the P&L and netting down to operating margin, I would expect you'd see a very similar trend starting in Q1 and building to higher amounts as you go first half, second half. So hopefully, that's clear, Travis. Travis Steed : Yes. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Cecilia Furlong with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Cecilia Furlong : Good morning. And thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask on WATCHMAN, specifically what's underlying the double-digit growth outlook that you called out for '23? How you're thinking about market growth as well as Japan and China contributions? And then just a quick follow-up on ACURATE neo2 with the Prime XL registry. How are you thinking about approval time lines at this point in the U.S.? Mike Mahoney : Sure. On WATCHMAN, we had a terrific year in '22. As I said, maintaining, call it, 90% share, potentially slightly above that, grew 24% for the full year. It's a very healthy market, so call it, 25% growth we expect in '23, two companies in the marketplace today.  Similar to previous comments, the success of WATCHMAN is really manyfold. The safety, consistency and proven effectiveness through clinical trial in everyday practice at WATCHMAN, physicians are extremely comfortable in using the device. They're very comfortable with the support team they have from Boston in the lab with them and the referring physician community is seeing such strong benefits from the LAs procedure that is helping to drive that market growth. So it's an excellent market. It's also a product that's -- a procedure that's profitable for hospitals. And the procedure time today continues to improve, which is really important for hospitals. So the overall market context is very good. We have the leading platform, and we have a new product, new steerable sheath coming this year and the next-gen WATCHMAN platform coming about a year from now. So we have a differentiated pipeline as well. Neo2 is doing extremely well in Europe. We just launched -- or just having some implementation of our XL valves. That's part of the U.S. trial. There was, I think, some -- a bit of inaccurate reporting on that one. We do not expect that XL to slow down the approval process for the U.S. So that does not have an impact on U.S. approval. And that XL valve is important because it's about a one-third of the procedures are using that size valve in Europe. So we're doing quite well, growing faster than market in Europe without that, and eventually, we'll be adding that to approval. So we're excited about that. ACURATE neo2, we expect it to be approved in 2024 in the U.S. Cecilia Furlong : Great. Thank you for taking the question. Operator : And the next question, currently, I have is Josh Jennings with Cowen. Please go ahead. JoshJennings: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping to start off with just your Apollo acquisition and get you into the diabetes -- sorry, not diabetes, the obesity segment. And I just wanted to hear about your outlook for that portfolio but also just device-based intervention opportunities in obesity from a higher level and whether this portfolio could become a long-term growth driver for the endoscopy franchise? And then the follow-up is just on your neuromodulation business. Congratulations on SOLIS trial results. And I think three of the big competitors in the space have a peripheral diabetic neuropathy indication now with different levels of evidence. But I was hoping you could just review Boston's plan to generate clinical evidence for that indication going forward? Thanks a lot. Mike Mahoney : Yes. So on Apollo Endosurgery overall, it's really consistent with our overall strategy of category leadership, which is driving above-market growth and continuing to advance new therapies where we can be the leader. When we look at endoluminal surgery, we think that is really the next frontier for our endo business. And you see a terrific uptake of endoluminal surgery, I would say, outside the U.S., particularly in Japan, a bit more so in Europe and less so in U.S. And so we think endoluminal surgery will really continue to build momentum over the next coming years and Apollo is a platform that's most used by physicians pick outside the U.S. to perform these procedures with a product called OverStitch and xTAC. So we think the addition of Apollo into our current platform will obviously make us the number one strongest endoluminal surgery portfolio, but also put us in a position, as Dr. Duncan would say, to help train the field because these are procedures that require significant physician training to get great outcomes, and we'll be able to do that with the Apollo platform. Unidentified Company Speaker : And then on Neuromod, I asked about SOLIS. Mike Mahoney : On SOLIS with SCS, again, we did see some improvement in that overall SCS business in the fourth quarter, growing 4% in the quarter. SOLIS, we're pleased with the three-month results that we expected. We expect indication and approval for nonsurgical back by the year-end of 2023. Unidentified Company Speaker : And we're in early clinical work for PDN right now and haven't announced any timelines, but we'll look to invest in that space.  And that concludes our call for today. So thank you for joining us. We appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific. If we were unable to get to your question or if you have any follow-ups, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Before you disconnect, Drew will give you all of the pertinent details for the replay. Drew?

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Boston Scientific Cardiology Business Update. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would like now to turn the program over to Jon Monson, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jonathan Monson : Thank you, Alan, and welcome, everyone, on the webcast. We have our Cardiology leadership team here today, including Joe Fitzgerald, Executive Vice President and Group President, Cardiology; Lance Bates, Senior Vice President and President, ICTx; Dr. Janar Sathananthan, Chief Medical Officer, ICTx; and Dr. Ken Stein, our Chief Medical Officer, who will join for the Q&A. Before we begin, we have a few housekeeping items. The duration of today's call will be approximately one hour. Q&A will follow our presentation, and we'll take questions through the webcast. We'll be making forward-looking statements. So you can see here our typical safe harbor and risk factors apply. You can see here our regulatory disclaimers and our financial disclaimers as well. So at this point, I'll turn the call over to Joe. Joe? Joseph Fitzgerald : Thanks, Jon. Appreciate it, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. Just an update on our Cardiology served markets. Today, we call this nearly a $40 billion market of things that are happening in the cath lab, growing in our projection at about an 8% CAGR through the end of '27. What I particularly like about this is if I compare this to maybe five or 10 years ago, we have multiple large, fast-growing markets. You can see the growth rates on the bottom. And our dependency on things like DES and defibrillators has obviously been transformed with multiple growth pillars on this -- in this market. If you look at our year-to-date growth. U.S. has been growing at 27%, international at 18%. You can see the individual growth rates below and the growth drivers associated with each of those. One thing in particular I like about our Q3 in Cardiology is we saw accelerated growth in both ICTx and in our EP business and still very solid growth coming from our WATCHMAN franchise as well. So a lot to like about what's happening year-to-date and what we did in Q3 across our Cardiology franchises. I'm not going to spend -- Lance is going to cover our ICTx stuff on the left of this slide. You've heard most of this on the most recent Q3 earnings call. One new thing that I want to report happened in the EP business this week, yesterday, in fact. So as you know, we got approval for the FARAVIEW mapping software module on OPAL earlier in the quarter. And we received the PMA supplemental approval for our FARAWAVE NAV, both mapping and ablation catheter. And I'm really proud to announce that we went live in multiple accounts mid this week and glad to report that the benefit, being able to map and avoid pulling an expensive high-density mapping catheter and the lesion tagging and the anatomy and the workflow of FARAVIEW was well demonstrated in each of the sites where we went live earlier in the week. So with that, I'll turn it over to Lance Bates, our President of Interventional Cardiology Therapies. Lance Bates : Hi there, everybody. This is Lance Bates, and I will walk us through more details on the markets that we serve. Again, continue to be very compelling and growing around 8% in total through 2027, about $15 billion. And these are the markets and the devices that are the tools for the interventional cardiology community. To give a little more context around drug-eluting therapies, globally, drug-eluting therapies, which includes our drug-eluting stents and our drug-coated balloon, is now growing close to double digits with drug-eluting stents at now less than 5%. That's less than 5% of our total company sales, which continues to show how we're diversifying our portfolio away from drug-eluting stents. Really excited that our AGENT launch in the U.S. continues to be super successful, and we expect to have double-digit and actually double our global drug-coated balloon business in 2025 over 2024. If we move to the next column and talk about complex PCI. You can see it's a very compelling market, over $4 billion. And just as a reminder, when we characterize complex PCI, it includes several served markets, which means IVL is in this number along with guide extensions and crossing wires, et cetera. We are growing in line with the market despite not having IVL in our portfolio at this time. And overall, complex PCI is a business that's now larger than our drug-eluting therapies business. I'd also like to really highlight some of the success we're having with our broad calcium portfolio and business, which includes Rotablator and WOLVERINE. And an example of our growth is that in the U.S., we are now growing mid-teens in Q3, and we expect this momentum to continue into 2025. If we move over to PCIG, which also includes physiology. It includes capital equipment for IVUS and our [SHV] for IVUS. We continue to outpace the market in terms of growth. And I'd really like to focus here on our IVUS [SHV] market share, which is now over 50% as we continue to launch our latest AVVIGO+ platform globally. So we're really enjoying the success there with our physician partners. And if we move over to the TAVR space. You can see it continues to be a very compelling market, high single-digit growth. And what I'd like to do is highlight our ACURATE performance in EMEA, where we continue to have growth approaching the 20% range, and we've now crossed the $200 million mark in revenue in EMEA with our ACURATE platform. We've also recently launched our Prime platform, and we continue to see strong momentum in the last few weeks that we've had it launched with its clinical performance such as the ease of use for commissure alignment, coronary access, both of which are critical for lifetime management of the patient. Now as we wrap up this slide, I'd call your attention to the bottom of the slide, where we've called out before our investments in the mechanical circulatory support space. And that diversification in this high-growth market is compelling for us and that we're excited to announce that we completed our EFS for the VITALYST system. And we continue to invest that we will be in this space and hopefully start our IDE in the U.S. by the end of 2025. If we go to the next slide. I'll do a bit more highlight and details on the success of integrating the portfolio and the pull-through power of our portfolio with AVVIGO and our AGENT DCB. If you look at the left, this highlights the fact that we continue to add to the compelling amount of data supporting the clinical viability of using IVUS in your procedures. We're now launched in 45 countries. And the good news as well is that we have a Class 1A indication for IVUS imaging and ESC guidelines, which is the highest level of guideline recommendation that's achievable. And we continue to see the adoption of AVVIGO+, which is the next gen above our AVVIGO base platform. And AVVIGO+ has advanced features such as automatic lesion assessment and things that make real-time measurements possible in the cath lab and is built upon AI. We have a tremendous AI platform capability in AVVIGO+ that we continue to invest in. And what you could see is that physicians see that benefit because when we have the AVVIGO+, they actually are using our imaging at a factor of 2x in more procedures compared to the base AVVIGO platform. In the center portion of the slide, I just want to continue to reiterate our philosophy in terms of our clinical treatment pathway. And that is you need to see what you're treating. That has to determine what you use to prepare or to make that vessel ready for the treatment, whether that treatment is a drug-eluting stent, it could be a drug-coated balloon or in some cases, leave the vessel alone. We have a super compelling success rate of where IVUS is now being used in 96% of our AGENT cases. And this is really, really important because we want to make sure physicians see the vessel appropriately to make sure that they are choosing the right therapy for that particular pathology. And that's great to see that physicians are using it 96% of the time. And then another key factor, and this is getting to the pull-through power of the portfolio with our calcium portfolio, is that a device was used to prep the vessel, meaning using some sort of calcium prep like Rotablator or WOLVERINE in 100% of all AGENT cases. So AGENT is being used in combination with our calcium treatment and our IVUS portfolio. If you look to the right. This is just a little bit of what we're looking to continue to investing in our leadership position, is potentially having additional clinical trials to focus on potential growth through indication and matrix expansion. Some of those areas could be long and diffuse lesions, small vessel disease, bifurcation. We potentially could look at the ACS patients, basically looking for the clinical opportunities that could have a benefit versus just putting in a drug-eluting stent as the first-line therapy. We're also excited to announce that our AGENT IDE for the 40-millimeter long lesion has started. And we are underway with the first patient having been enrolled. So very excited about the full portfolio. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Janar Sathananthan. Janar Sathananthan : Thank you, Lance. So I'm going to take you through the ACURATE IDE trial. This was a trial that -- to remind the group what's presented today as a late-breaking clinical trial at TCT 2024 by Professor Michael Reardon from the Houston Methodist center. In terms of its study design, this was a large prospective randomized controlled trial, 1,500 patients that were randomized to two groups, one group being the test arm with ACURATE neo2 and the mix control group representing two commercial valves in the United States with the Evolut and Sapien platform in a 2/3:1/3 ratio. Composite endpoints was an endpoint of all-cause mortality stroke or rehospitalization at one year, which is the primary endpoint, and with planned follow-up out to 10 years. I'll reinforce that this is the largest head-to-head TAVR trial that has been done and an important data set. The trial was -- had some complexity related to it. That is one of the largest TAVR trials done in a head-to-head fashion with an all-risk patient population and was also impacted at time points by the COVID pandemic. There were also, as a result of that, issues with enrollment pace with a 4-year enrollment period at an average of approximately three months between cases at an individual site. There were issues with supply constraints and also low operator experience with approximately 3/4 of implanters implanting less than five ACURATE neo2 valves. And of course, we're all well aware of the staffing and case support concerns during the pandemic. On the left-hand side of the screen is the primary endpoint, which was a Bayesian endpoint. You can see here that we had a noninferiority median difference of 6.63 with a noninferiority margin of 8%, where our upper bound exceeds the prespecified noninferiority margin. So noninferiority of the ACURATE neo2 platform versus control, but the primary endpoint was not met in this study. On the right-hand side, you can see what was performed in a post-hoc analysis, which was a careful assessment of all the cases that were implanted with ACURATE. And as part of this work, there was clearly some inconsistencies that were identified with regards to procedural steps, specifically pre and post-dilatation, which were discorded from commercial practice that we see in other markets where the valve is commercial. As a result, there was an impact on valve expansion, which you can see on the images on the right-hand side. Through this post-hoc work, very easy binary way was assessed to identify severe valve under expansion, which is the image on the right. And that was seen in approximately 20% of cases with the other 80% of cases having adequate expansion. When specifically looking at that breakdown in this curve between ACURATE neo2 valves that were expanded versus those that were underexpanded relative to control, the outcomes with ACURATE neo2 valves that were expanded were better. And specifically on this next curve, I'll spend a little bit more time and detail on this because if you look at the hard endpoints of death and stroke, when you look at the breakdown of these two groups, and I'll focus on the left-hand side, you can see that purple represents ACURATE neo2 valves that were underexpanded, and the rates of events are much higher relative to neo2 -- ACURATE neo2 valves that are expanded relative to the control, where the rates are numerically the same or very similar, 3.7 versus 3.6. And similarly, that trend is also seen with relation to stroke, where ACURATE neo2 valves that are expanded have a very similar rate to control at 3.5% and 3.4% in comparison to the purple curve where you can see events of strokes are much higher when the valve is underexpanded. This is some work that has been done by our engineering team, which looks at mechanisms for this. I'll remind the cohort that when we looked at clinically relevant valve thrombosis, this was actually significantly less with the ACURATE platform versus control. However, when we looked at the impact of potential underexpansion, if I focus your attention to the images on the top, you can see that this is a valve that has expanded well. It has what looks to be a nice Mercedes-Benz sign, and the leaflets coapt and open in a very symmetrical way. The image on the right -- top right shows you what the flow looks like, which is a very lamina and column-like flow of blood. In comparison to the bottom image, you can see that, that Mercedes-Benz sign no longer exists. This results in impaired movement of that leaflet. And similarly, on the bottom right-hand corner, you can see that there's -- the red symbolizes very turbulent flow. And so this may lead from certainly our understanding on the bench to mechanisms that may explain some of the events and why having an expanded valve is better, clearly demonstrated by the data. As Lance mentioned, we're encouraged by our ACURATE Prime platform that was launched in -- recently in the last few weeks. I remind the group that this also has incorporation of an additional size, which increases the potential eligible patient population to approximately an additional 20% for the available valve matrix. It also has some enhancements to the frame, which increases the radial force by about 20%. And the delivery system has been further enhanced to optimize ease of use. And here, you can see Professor De Backer with one of his successful first cases in Copenhagen in Europe. There were also some other important relevant data that was presented at TCT across our entire franchises. On the left-hand side, we also did have another late-breaking clinical trial looking at our SENTINEL device. This was a post-hoc analysis from the PROTECTED TAVR study, specifically looking at the U.S. cohort, which represented approximately 2/3 of the overall PROTECTED TAVR study cohort. And it demonstrated in this post-hoc analysis that there was a lower rate of overall stroke at 72 hours and also a significantly lower rate of disabling stroke at 72 hours in the U.S. cohort. And also patients did not -- also had much lower likelihood of needing additional services and were able to return home more likely, which, of course, is an important consideration for patients. And no major safety endpoints were identified. With regards to our AGENT drug-coated balloon, which we are in the midst of, of course, launching and continuing to expand across the United States, this is an important first-to-market drug-coated balloon. We have continued to also look at three subgroups from the AGENT IDE trial, which looks at three different focuses, particularly two patient groups, which are, of course, important for physicians, which is minorities versus white patients, males versus females and also vessel characteristics between small and large vessels. And in all three of those, we see consistent benefit of AGENT drug-coated balloon across those three groups. Turning your attention to the right-hand side of the slide with regards to our WATCHMAN FLX Pro device. This is -- the HEAL LAA clinical study was also presented, which was a post-market study. Important to stress that this study met its 6-month primary safety endpoint for all-cause mortality, stroke, systemic embolism and major bleeding. And what is encouraging is also that it met its 45-day primary efficacy endpoint with zero cases of leak observed. And we remain reassured by the sealing ability of WATCHMAN FLX Pro. So in summary, that summarizes the ACURATE IDE data but also some of the other key data that was presented at TCT 2024. Jonathan Monson : Excellent. Well, thanks, everyone, and we will move now to Q&A for the next 40 minutes or so. And Alan, can you reiterate the instructions on how to submit a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Jonathan Monson : All right. Well, great, everyone. We've got questions coming in. So I will read them out top to bottom, and the team can answer them here. So first one here from Robbie Marcus. Says, two for me. Do you expect these results to negatively impact sales in Europe? And actually, we've got a few of these questions that have come in. And so why don't we hit that one first, and then we'll answer Joe. Lance Bates : All right. Thanks, Jon. I'd say it's -- at this point, we're still very pleased with the results of Prime and the ACURATE platform overall. And as many of you know, we've got a lot more experience in Europe, and that's why we've been enjoying a 20% growth rate. The physicians there had almost a decade of experience with the platform. And what I would say is that we're going to continue to monitor this closely and stay involved and make sure that the physicians in Europe have the learnings that we shared at TCT and continue to support the platform and continue to monitor the situation. Jonathan Monson : Great. Thanks. And then come up part two here from Robbie from JPMorgan. Why didn't physicians have better training and oversight in the trial? Underinflating the valve is normally something that we don't see in trials. Dr. Sathananthan? Janar Sathananthan : Yes. So thank you, Robbie, for the question. I'll just clarify that underinflation or underinflating the valve refers to a balloon expandable valve and filling volume specific to the ACURATE platform. What was observed was the difference with regards to the sizing of a pre-dilatation balloon, which is a preparatory step required before ACURATE is implanted. I touched on some of the factors related to that, which I will remind the group that the study started enrolling in 2019, and the peak of the COVID pandemic occurred soon after. So as a result, as we're all well aware of, this prevented ability for outside groups or physician support to be presented in cases. And there were also significant supply chain issues with regards to available equipment that may have impacted the results. Jonathan Monson : All right. Thank you. Next question comes from Travis Steed at Bank of America. Actually, Travis had a similar question on the European business. I think I'll skip over that. And so then second question from Travis. When will we be able to see Prime data in the trial? Is it likely to have the same limitation as neo2? Janar Sathananthan : So as part of the ACURATE IDE study, we did have a nested registry looking at Prime XL, which is the next-generation system, as you saw in the slide. There will be data presented at London Valves with the ACURATE -- or the first report of the ACURATE Prime system. Jonathan Monson : All right. And our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. And several questions on the regulatory path from here. So when do you expect to file with the FDA? Do you anticipate the FDA calling for an Ad Comm? Dr. Reardon felt strongly about the FDA looking at the totality of the data. Could the FDA ask for a small follow-up study? So maybe Lance or Dr. Sathananthan, just your thoughts on the FDA path and Vijay's question. Janar Sathananthan : Yes. Well, thanks for the question. We remain in active discussions with the FDA at this time with regards to our regulatory pathway forward. Joseph Fitzgerald : I think as well with the questions on panel and what kind of trial, that panel is hard to predict for any sort of original PMA submission. So it's hard to answer that. And the exact question on is there additional data needed and what is that type of data, how large, what type of follow-up, we just -- we're still in active discussions. So need to take those further before we can really get granular on that. Jonathan Monson : Got it. Thanks, Joe. And similar questions from Matt O'Brien, Piper. Matt, I'm just reading through your questions here. Similar on the FDA pathway. Maybe Lance or Joe, a question here. How much would you be saving if you decide against investing in a domestic TAVR program? So maybe just a question about the TAVR program in the U.S. Is it still compelling? Lance Bates : Yes. I think it's definitely a compelling market, as we showed on one of the slides I presented. It's also -- frankly, it's a space to -- that you have to be a complete structural heart player. And I think we've disclosed before that we've got investments in tricuspid and mitral and electrosurgery-type devices. TAVR is a critical component. So we view ourselves that, ultimately, we want to be a full portfolio player in structural heart to serve the interventional cardiologist. Just as we have on the coronary side of the business, we are committed to the interventional cardiology space. And we are continuing to invest in the full structural heart portfolio broadly. Joseph Fitzgerald : I think it's a similar question that we faced with in EP for years, right? We literally executed about a 20-year strategy, multiple acquisitions, a lot of wins, some losses to be a meaningful player in what today is probably greater than a $9 billion market. Did it go as fast as I wanted? No. Was it as easy as I would have wanted? No. But we've talked about this, and you saw it in my first slide. We want to be the preeminent cardiology company. The SHV space is $6.7 billion, growing high single digits. So don't be surprised if we're really resilient even as we hit some adverse times like the outcome of this study. But as I have mentioned before, right, we have some questions to answer regarding pathway to the U.S. And we're active with FDA and getting those pathways identified. Jonathan Monson : Great. Thank you. All right. Next question from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. For the ACURATE IDE, how much of the valve underexpansion might be addressed by the larger valve size, Prime, and so did not having that in the trial impacts the outcome? Janar Sathananthan : Yes. Thank you for the question. I guess I'll just clarify, firstly, that what we have launched in Europe is Prime across all the sizes. And so one thing that may potentially impact expansion is that the Prime design does have an increased radial force strength of approximately 20%. So we will continue to understand the impact of that moving forward. In terms of mitigation, we feel strongly, as was iterated in the presentation in the late-breaking trial, that this can be corrected with procedural factors and specifically the performance of adequate pre-dilatation with an appropriate-sized balloon, and also post-dilatation, we'll be able to address the majority of this underexpansion if and when it occurs. Joseph Fitzgerald : Janar, can you also highlight -- because I think it was important at our symposium. The normal things that we look at PDL, EOA, can you just go through sort of like beyond that, what this alignment has done for our understanding for the ACURATE platform? Janar Sathananthan : Yes, it's a good question, Joe. So I think as part of our deep dive, there was a theme that emerged that we're seeing more and more of these conversations about underexpansion in the entire TAVR space. This is a similar journey that was -- happened within the stent era where post-dilation and optimization with imaging also came about in the stent era. Some of the discussion that we've seen in the deep dive and certainly related to the TAVR space is that typically the two reasons that we think about ballooning a valve is to address paravalvular leak or elevated gradients. And what we saw in the ACURATE IDE trial was actually the gradients were actually better for ACURATE than balloon-expandable valve, and also leak was not a concern. And so this is a sign that -- and certainly, we've updated all of our training that identifying and correcting for expansion is also going to be a key part and I think an important point for the entire TAVR space. Jonathan Monson : All right. Thank you. And next question, another question here from Vijay from Evercore. I'll do my best for this one, definitely, Janar and Joe. So how can we explain why a normal echo finding at 30 days would underexpand at one year? Is this a sign of valve design, for example, not strong radial force? And do you want the second part or hit that one first? Janar Sathananthan : Yes. I can start with that. So the use of an echo as follow-up times after TAVR, which are typically the next day afterwards or 30 days as it was done in this trial and also after one year, it's really to look predominantly at leak and gradients. Echo is a poor imaging modality to look at expansion. What we have found from our learnings from this trial is that we have identified a very simple fluoroscopic method to identify underexpansion of ACURATE that can be seen at the time of the procedure and also optimize with ballooning. And so it's -- and so I think that's the key message from the IDE findings. Jonathan Monson : Got it. And part two. And if we do use post-dilatation, how do we know how much pressure one should be using? Is there a risk of higher pacemaker rates if you expand too much? Janar Sathananthan : Yes. So I would say that the key piece is the size of the balloon that is used. In our recommendation, certainly for commercial use since the valve has been on the market for over 10 years commercially in Europe, the pre-dilatation balloon size is 1 millimeter below the perimeter drive diameter. That was not followed in approximately 80% of the cases in the ACURATE IDE trial. Similarly, with post-dilatation, you would use up to a similar-sized balloon for post-dilation or relative to the annulus. We have seen that in Europe, and there's lots of data that shows consistently single-digit pacemaker rates with the ACURATE platform in all U.S. data. Jonathan Monson : Got it. All right. Next question from Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo. And Joe, Lance, you touched on this earlier, but maybe ask this again from Larry. How committed are you to neo2? Would you do another randomized clinical trial if FDA asks for one? Lance Bates : Well, I'd say, Larry, just to clarify, neo2, we've now transitioned to Prime. And so Prime is the next-generation platform that is being launched commercially in Europe that, as we mentioned earlier, has got some excellent clinical benefits compared to neo2 as well. And I would say we are committed to the platform, and we are going to continue to work with the FDA on what's the most efficient, prudent path forward with ACURATE Prime in the U.S. and in other markets around the world. Jonathan Monson : All right. Thanks, Lance. And got an IVUS question here from Patrick Wood at Morgan Stanley. Do you have any plans to move into AI interpretation of CT scans to measure plaque as a longer-term alternative or complement to IVUS? Janar Sathananthan : Yes. And I think maybe part of the question also relates to the high use of IVUS in relation to AGENT use. I would say, Patrick, we have been very encouraged by the high utility of imaging to plan procedures with the commercial launch of AGENT in ISR that has been encouraged in guidelines, and of course, reflects our strategy and teachings around see, prep, treat in the space. We've also seen that imaging has impacted valve preparation as well. And we've seen increased use of WOLVERINE for lesion preparation in our commercial cases. We're also fairly committed to IVUS as a platform, and part of impetus for AVVIGO+ is the incorporation of AI to make it easier for physicians to interpret with the aid of technology. And we plan future software updates to that end and subsequent iterations of the system. Jonathan Monson : Great. All right. Next question, embolic protection SENTINEL question here from Joanne Wuensch at Citi. Does the new embolic protection data on SENTINEL change your view on utilization? Janar Sathananthan : Yes. I think it's important also just to be cautious that this was a sub-study and a post-hoc analysis of an overall negative study. I do believe, though, that it is valuable to continue to understand the utility of this technology. And physicians are clearly looking for areas where the technology will be beneficial. So I think it highlights more the need for further evidence in this space. Jonathan Monson : All right. Back to ACURATE. This is from Mike Polark with Wolfe. Why was the post-hoc analysis only done on approximately 700 of the 1,500 total patients with their imaging limitations? Janar Sathananthan : Yes. So firstly, I'll reiterate this was an RCT, so 1 :1 randomization. So there's 750 ACURATE cases. We interpreted all the available images. And so there are approximately 47 cases that did not have an image that could be interpreted for expansion. Joseph Fitzgerald : I think it's fair to say, Janar, we looked at all of the ACURATE cases to explain the data that we were surprised by, right? And so we looked at half of the patients in the trial, which were the test. We didn't go back and look at the control. Janar Sathananthan : No. That's true. Jonathan Monson : All right. Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Do you expect Prime may be part of the path forward for potential FDA approval? Would that require a registry or something more? Lance Bates : As we've said, Prime is the platform for TAVR globally. And we are still in communication and conversations with the FDA to determine what that path forward is. We just don't know right now. Jonathan Monson : And next question, kind of similar vein, Jayson Bedford, Raymond James. Maybe other regions, does this data impact ACURATE Prime approval in other regions, for example, Japan? Maybe path in Japan. Lance Bates : Potentially, again, it's the same situation that we're dealing with, where we're collaborating with the FDA first. And we will simultaneously start communicating with the Japanese regulatory authorities as well. Joseph Fitzgerald : Fair to say that the ACURATE IDE was our clinical trial set for both Japan, China and other markets like the U.S., where we're not approved. So we're going to have to have -- like Lance said, we're going to have similar conversations with each of those regulatory authorities. Jonathan Monson : Great. Thank you. Okay. Another one from Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo. Ken, this may be for you. It's on the Inari PEERLESS data. Would just love your view on the Inari PEERLESS data and what impact you expect relative to EKOS. Kenneth Stein : Sure, Larry. I think first off, right, it's just good to see more data come out on interventional therapies for the management of pulmonary embolism. They're still way underutilized. And I think the really important clinical question is just how do interventional therapies like EKOS compared to standard of care, which is anticoagulation alone. I think as you look at the comparison, EKOS, right, realized this is a very complicated composite endpoint using a win ratio. And when you look at the really important objective measures like mortality, intracranial hemorrhage and bleeding outside of the brain, right, there were really no differences in between the arms that were studied. And I think, again, recognizing that being observed in an ICU as an endpoint is guaranteeing a certain result since that's standard of care when you're getting catheter-directed thrombolysis. So we're still very confident in the performance of EKOS and look forward to the results of our HI-PEITHO study. Jonathan Monson : Excellent. Thanks, Dr. Stein. And next question from Travis Steed, Bank of America. And Joe, maybe if you could take this. Any additional color you could provide on the FARAWAVE launch? Are you seeing in those accounts -- are you seeing any changes in the percentage of cases being mapped, any impact, taking share from other mapping, changes in penetration of PFA? So maybe a little more color on, I think, FARAWAVE and the OPAL launch would be helpful. Joseph Fitzgerald : Yes. Thanks, Travis. I think we have said this before. But if you look today globally, this is basically Europe, select Asia markets and the United States. One of the things we love about FARAWAVE is it is consistent or can be done in any one of a number of workflows. So if I take Germany as an example, FARAWAVE is largely used in a fluoro-only workflow. If I go to Czech Republic, it is used in a fluoro aided by ICE visualization. And if I go to other markets like the United States or let's call it, Spain, mapping is done in the vast majority of our FARAWAVE cases. So we're about 36 hours into the FARAVIEW launch. But here's our expectation, is that because of the uniqueness of FARAWAVE 2.0 on FARAVIEW, on OPAL, our belief is that our percentage market share of the cases where mapping is used should go up dramatically from where it is today. Why is that? A couple of reasons. Number one, the FARAWAVE catheter now on the FARAVIEW system is both the mapping and ablation catheter. So you avoid the use of a very expensive high-density system, point one. Point two, viewing FARAWAVE on OPAL and on FARAVIEW, that is the only platform, our proprietary platform where you can see dynamic visualization of the actual catheter. No matter what shape, biscuit, basket, flower or whatever else we call it, I don't know, because of the nav sensor and because of the integration into our proprietary mapping system. The third reason that makes us confident that we'll take meaningful share in the mapping market is our proprietary sort of lesion targeting and lesion tracking. So because it's a combined, integrated system, you cannot do what we do on other systems where they're kind of using and hodgepodging together an impedence-based workflow. So those three reasons, I think, say that we are very comfortable in saying that we'll take share in the mapped cases of FARAWAVE. Jonathan Monson : All right. Thanks, Joe. Next question from Travis Steed at Bank of America. You suspended enrollment in the single arm continued access study but continue to enroll in the extended durability cohorts. Why did the FDA allow you to keep that extended durability cohort enrolling? Janar Sathananthan : Yes. Thanks for the question. I mean we've been in collaboration with the FDA. And with regards to the extended durability cohort, there was a desire to complete enrollment of all the randomized controlled cohort patients and also the various sub-studies. One other important point of context for the extended durability is that we were able to bring in optimized training for the back segment of that trial. And we were able to see real differences in operator adherence to the pre-dilatation balloon and also a change in the post-dilatation as well with the optimized training. Jonathan Monson : Okay. Our next question is from Imron Zafar from Deutsche Bank. And Lance, maybe you can hit this one. Can you give some more color around your mitral and tricuspid investments, anything in terms of timing, specific device categories, repair, replace? So maybe a bit of a broader lens on the bets that we have out there. Lance Bates : Sure. We won't disclose specifics at this time other than to say we do have investments in the combination of our VC portfolio, which continues to be really strong, as well as some hybrid structures where we've got collaborations with other entities that we've stood up. And what I would say, if you look at tricuspid, we have both bets and repair and replace. We find that both therapies potentially could be compelling as more and more data comes out. So we want to have broad bets. In mitral, we have a bet that's more on the repair side. We continue to evaluate would be appropriate bets potentially on the replacement side. And then as I mentioned earlier, electrosurgery is very interesting to us, especially as structural heart becomes more complex in terms of leaflet modification or excisions or LVOT obstruction issues. Some of the new heart failure drugs are creating opportunities with the Holcomb patient. So there's a -- we see a lot of opportunities there that we've also invested in and plan to leverage some of our own internal capabilities. So we have a very broad view. And as Joe said earlier, this is not something we're investing in for the short term. This is the long-term success of this portfolio and this franchise for the long-term value of the company. Jonathan Monson : All right. Well, thanks. We've -- so we've reached the end of our queue. So with that, I want to thank everyone on the webcast today for your time and your interest.

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Lauren Tengler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Lauren Tengler : Thank you, Kyle. Welcome everyone, and thanks for joining us today. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q2 2023 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations on the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials & Filings. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately 1 hour. Mike and Dan will provide comments on Q1 performance as well as the outlook for our business including Q2 and full year 2023 guidance. And then, we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales. Relevant acquisitions and divestitures excluded for organic growth or Baylis Medical, which closed on February 14, 2022. The majority stake investment in Acotec Scientific Holdings Limited and Apollo Endosurgery, which closed in February and April of this year, respectively. Divestitures include the endoscopy pathology business, which closed April of this year. Please note that, we have elected to consolidate Acotec results on a one quarter lag, which had an immaterial impact on our Q2 reported and adjusted results. On June 15, 2022, we announced our entry into a definitive agreement to purchase a majority stake in M.I. Tech, the agreement required global regulatory approvals that we were unable to obtain in some countries. As a result, the original agreement was terminated and in June of this year, we purchased a minority stake in M.I. Tech. For more information, please refer to our financial and operating highlights deck, which may be found on our Investor Relations website. On this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified are organic. This call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate expect, may, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth in market share, new and anticipated product approvals and launches, acquisitions, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. If our underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect or if certain risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections used on \u2013 or expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements.

These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike. Mike? Mike Mahoney : Thanks, Lauren, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. We're very proud of our second quarter results, which exceeded our expectations and demonstrated the strength of our category leadership strategy, commitment to clinical evidence, and the winning spirit of our global team. In second quarter '23, total company sales grew 12%, both operationally and organically versus second quarter '22, exceeding the high end of our organic guidance range of 7% to 9%. We anticipate that most of our business units grew in line or faster than the respective markets, fueled by our innovative portfolio and commercial execution, also supported by healthy procedure demand. Second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.53 grew 21% versus second quarter '22, exceeding the high end of the guidance range of $0.48 to $0.50. And second quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.8%, also slightly higher than anticipated. Through the first half of the year, we have grown their business organic sales rate at 13%, with broad-based durable growth across all of our business units and regions. Importantly, we have also grown our adjusted EPS growth 20% during the first half, while balancing our investments to ensure we achieve our short-term and long-term goals. Now for our 2023 guidance, we're guiding the third quarter '23 organic revenue growth of 7% to 9% and we expect momentum to continue and are raising our full year organic guidance to 10% to 11%. Our third quarter adjusted EPS estimate is $0.46 to $0.48 and we're increasing our full year adjusted EPS range to $1.96 to $2. I'll now provide some additional highlights in the second quarter, along with comments on our '23 outlook, and Dan will provide more details on the financials. Regionally, and on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 9% in second quarter, with notable strength in our WATCHMAN, PI and Endoscopy businesses. Europe, Middle East Africa also grew 9% on an operational basis versus second quarter, with strong performance in the region was broad-based, with double-digit growth in four out of our five major markets in Europe. Across the portfolio, we saw strength in new and ongoing product launches, including FARAPULSE, POLARx, ACURATE neo2 and LUX-DX. Asia Pacific grew 24% operationally versus second quarter, led by strength in China and Japan. Japan growth is fueled by new products, including agent, our drug-coated balloon for the coronary arteries, and resume our minimally invasive BPH technology with device performance and procedures that leave nothing behind is resonating in the market. China delivered excellent growth in the second quarter, led by our innovative portfolio and commercial execution against the COVID impact second quarter '22. We also saw particular strength in our interventional cardiology therapies, WATCHMAN, CRM and PI business units and we continue to expect double-digit growth in China for the full year. I'll now provide some additional commentary on our businesses. Starting with urology. Urology sales grew 8% organically in the second quarter. The stone management franchise grew double-digits, driven by LithoVue and ongoing globalization efforts. Rezum continues to do well globally, growing strong double-digits in the quarter and most recently launching in Brazil. We continue to see ongoing momentum within our prosthetic urology franchise, fueled by patient activation efforts. designed to bring awareness to our erectile restoration and male incontinence interventions. Endoscopy sales were excellent, growing 12% organically and 14% operationally in the second quarter, with notable strength in the U.S., Latin America and Asia-Pac, with new product momentum and healthy procedure demand. Our Apollo integration is progressing well and earlier this month that we received FDA clearance for OverStitch NXT, a suturing system that enables suture placement during advanced endoscopic procedures. This next-generation device brings ease-of-use benefits and improved accessibility when using a single-channel endoscope. Neuromodulation sales grew 3% organically in the second quarter. Spinal cord stimulation sales were flat versus prior year and we expect SCS sales growth to improve in the second half of the year, with strong trialing in the second quarter in support of clinical evidence, which was presented this month at Aspen. Notably, six-month outcome data were reported from the SOLIS trial, which is a randomized controlled trial for non-surgical back pain, which demonstrated superior outcomes for SCS against conventional medical management, also consistent with primary endpoint results. Our brain franchise grew double-digits in the quarter, with continued momentum from new product launches in the U.S. and procedure recovery in Europe. Earlier this month, we received FDA approval for the Vercise Neural Navigator 5 software, which when used with our deep brain stimulation system can help provide clinicians with data for efficient programming in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Peripheral Interventions sales were very strong growing 13% organically versus second quarter '22. Our arterial franchise grew double-digits, led by our drug eluting portfolio. And earlier this month, after reviewing all available data and analysis, the FDA provided updated information associated with paclitaxel-coated devices used to treat PAD, recognizing the safety of these devices and eliminating the requirement for specific warning language within device-related labeling. We're pleased that the FDA determined that the available data do not support an excess mortality risk and we remain dedicated to helping physicians provide the best care possible for their patients. In Venous, U.S. growth was led by ongoing strength in Varithena, a non-thermal treatment for varicose veins, with international growth driven by our clot management technologies. Our Interventional Oncology franchise grew double-digits with strength across the entire portfolio. And last month, we received clearance for the EMBOLD, Soft and Packing Coils, which along with the EMBOLD fibroid coil, complete our detachable coil system. We also began our limited market release for Obsidio, which is the only conformable gel embolic material that's indicated for the peripheral vasculature, adding to our robust embolization portfolio. Cardiology delivered another excellent quarter with organic sales growth of 13% versus second quarter. Within cardiology, the Interventional Cardiology Therapies business, sales grew 12% organically versus second quarter. Our coronary therapies franchise growth was driven by our innovative imaging technologies as well as the recent launch of our agent drug-coated balloon in Japan, offsetting ongoing price pressure in drug eluting stents. Our structural heart valves franchise grew strong double-digits with another quarter of performance from our ACURATE neo2 in Europe. Market reception remains very high, backed by clinical evidence, ease-of-use benefits and a focus on lifetime patient management. We continue to expect to bring ACURATE neo2 to the U.S. in the second half of 2024. WATCHMAN sales grew 27% organically versus second quarter, also outpacing the market. U.S. demand remains strong and international growth was led by China and Japan. We were pleased to have completed enrollment in the WATCHMAN FLX Pro CT pilot study, which is a single study design using multiple imaging modalities to assess post-procedural healing in the next generation of WATCHMAN FLX Pro. We expect continued momentum within the WATCHMAN franchise further supported by the anticipated approval of our both WATCHMAN FLX Pro and our steerable sheath called Trusteer (ph) by the end of 2023. Cardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 5% organically in the quarter. In core CRM, our high-voltage business grew low-single digits and our low-voltage business grew mid-single digits, and we believe that performance was in line or slightly below market growth as the replacement tailwinds neutralize. Our diagnostic franchise grew double-digits in the quarter on the strength of our broad cardiac diagnostic portfolio and we anticipate momentum will continue, supported by the approval of our next-generation ICM called LUX 2 expected later this year. Electrophysiology sales grew 28% organically in the second quarter. International growth continues to be fueled by strong performance in both FARAPULSE and POLARx across Europe and Asia-Pac. We continue to make progress towards bringing these innovative technologies to the U.S., and we expect POLARx approval in the third quarter. In addition, we are looking forward to the data presentation of the ADVENT trial, our U.S. IDE, at the ESC Conference on August 27. Recall the ADVENT trial is a first of its kind, randomized clinical trial, designed for a non-inferior 12-month primary safety and efficacy endpoints compared to a commercially available RF and cryoablation systems. It is notable for its design and rigor as it seeks to demonstrate the single procedure effectiveness of an intervention without the use of antiarrhythmic drugs and reablations. We continue to anticipate the approval of FARAPULSE in the U.S. in 2024. The Access Solutions franchise grew strong double-digits in the second quarter with continued momentum in the U.S. and Japan with a differentiated VersaCross Transseptal platform. We're also proud of the performance of our global teams and are confident in our future. We remain committed to sustainable innovation and our financial goals, consistently growing sales faster than our underlying markets, expanding operating margins and delivered strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth with a strong adjusted free cash flow generation. We're looking forward to our September 20 Investor Day, where our leadership team will provide more insight into our innovative pipeline today, the opportunities ahead and our long-term financial goals. So before I pass it along to Dan, I want to announce that we also have some movement within our business unit leadership team. And after nearly 20 years at Boston Scientific, Maulik Nanavaty has announced his plan to retire in August. Jim Cassidy will now lead the neuromodulation business, where he previously spent eight years prior before moving over to lead the WATCHMAN franchise five years ago. Lastly, Angelo DeRosa will now lead our WATCHMAN business. Angelo has spent the last 10 years of Boston Scientific in Europe, most recently leading the European CRM and EP business. Congratulations to Jim and Angelo and we appreciate Maulik for his many contributions to Neuromodulation in Boston Scientific throughout his career. With that, I'll pass it over to Dan to provide more details on the financials. Dan Brennan : Thanks, Mike. Second quarter 2023 consolidated revenue of $3.599 billion represents 11% reported revenue growth versus the second quarter of 2022 and reflects a 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, in line with expectations. Excluding this $33 million headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 12% in the quarter. Sales from acquisitions and divestitures contributed 30 basis points, resulting in 11.6% organic revenue growth, exceeding our guidance range of 7% to 9%. Q2 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $0.53 grew 20.7% versus 2022, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.48 to $0.50, driven by strong sales performance and a favorable effective tax rate in the quarter. Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 72%, slightly ahead of our expectations, resulting in an adjusted gross margin of 71.2% for the first half of 2023. We continue to expect second half gross margin to be lower than the first half of 2023 and in line with the second half of 2022, largely due to timing of foreign exchange movements in 2022. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.8%, slightly ahead of expectations, predominantly driven by strong top line performance and partially offset by slightly higher SG&A spend. We continue to focus on adjusted operating margin expansion and are maintaining our full year 2023 goal of approximately 26.4% adjusted operating margin, which would represent 80 basis points of improvement versus the full year 2022. On a GAAP basis, the second quarter operating margin was 14.3%. Moving to below the line, second quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $93 million, slightly higher than expectations, driven by FX volatility in certain unhedged currencies. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the second quarter was 9.8%, slightly below expectations due to certain discrete tax items and a lower than anticipated operational tax rate of 13.2%, driven by our geographic mix of earnings in the quarter. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1,456 million shares in Q2, which includes the issuance of 23.98 million common shares upon the conversion of our mandatory convertible preferred stock on June 1 of this year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $514 million, with $658 million from operating activities, less $143 million net capital expenditures. Excluding special items, adjusted free cash flow was $730 million. We continue to target full year 2023 adjusted free cash flow in excess of $2.3 billion. As of June 30, 2023, we had cash on hand of $426 million and our leverage was 2.4 times, in line with our expectations. I'll now walk through guidance for Q3 and the full year. We expect full year 2023 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 11% to 12%, which excludes an approximate 50 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect full year 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 10% to 11% versus 2022. We expect third quarter 2023 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 8% to 10% versus Q3 2022, excluding an approximate 50 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange based on current rates. Excluding the contribution from closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect third quarter 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 7% to 9%. We continue to expect our full year 2023 adjusted below the line expenses to be approximately $340 million. We continue to expect our full year 2023 operational tax rate to be approximately 14%. Under current legislation and forecasted geographic mix of sales, we now expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 12.5%, reflecting favorable tax discretes recognized in the second quarter. We expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.475 billion shares for Q3 2023 and 1.464 billion shares for full year 2023. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.96 to $2, representing 15% to 17% growth versus 2022, which we believe delivers top tier financial performance. We continue to anticipate a neutral impact from FX on our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share and we expect third quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.46 to $0.48. For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q2 2023 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q2 results and 2023 guidance. In closing, I'm very proud of our first half financial performance with top tier organic revenue growth of 13%, adjusted operating margin of 26.2% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 20%, all contributing towards our top-tier financial goals. I look forward to continued momentum in the second half of 2023. And with that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A. Lauren Tengler : Thanks, Dan. Kyle, let's open it up for questions for the next 35 minutes or so. In order for us to take as many questions as possible, please limit their self to one question. Kyle, please go ahead. Operator : Thank you, Lauren. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Robert Marcus : Good morning and congrats on a really nice quarter. Mike Mahoney : Thanks, Robbie. Robert Marcus : Maybe with my one question. It looks like you guys beat pretty much across the board with the exception of neuromodulation. It looks like it was a really strong geographically as well, split across the regions. We've heard from some public statements from managed care companies that outpatients saw kind of a bolus in utilization, but it looks like it was global as well. So I'd love to get the read from you on what you're seeing, what's underlying demand, what is maybe onetime upside, and what you're seeing in the different regions around the world? And if there's any difference inpatient, outpatient, cardio versus non-cardio? Thanks a lot. Mike Mahoney : Sure. Good morning, Robbie. Yeah. So as you know, our portfolio is with the interventional procedures that we offer are very geared to an outpatient setting, in which we think is very positive trend and strategy for the long-term outlook for Boston Scientific, that's where the market is moving towards. So just a quick snapshot around the world. Japan had a very strong quarter just -- really that's primarily portfolio related. China had an excellent quarter. There was an easier comp in second quarter last year due to COVID impact. But I think that whole outpatient dynamic doesn't really play as significantly as much in Asia-Pac there. But really, it's more portfolio related for Japan, some COVID benefit, but great performance in China. And I think what's impressive about Europe, it's really across the board, across all the regions and the emerging markets. Some slowness in Russia, but we're lightly exposed in Russia, less than 1% and U.S. grew 9% as well. You've seen a bit higher proportion of outpatient procedures in the U.S than some of the other regions. But we continue to see just very strong patient demand. There's still a typically a very common wait list for most of our procedures for physicians. So it's a very steady supply and we have a terrific portfolio to meet the market. Robert Marcus : Thanks a lot. Mike Mahoney : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning and thank you for asking \u2013 for taking the question, let me ask. As soon as you print this very good quarter, I'm going to get 15 questions about or more about what to expect for ESC and for the analyst meeting. So maybe you can sort of set or level set what you expect or how we should think about putting those two events within the right framework? Mike Mahoney : Sure. I'll -- maybe Dr. Stein comment and I'll see if I need to comment further afterwards. Kenneth Stein : Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Joanne. Obviously, our big highlight at ESC is going to be the release of the data from Advent, which is, I think as everyone is aware at this point, our IDE trial to seek approval of FARAPULSE in the United States. We're really proud of the rigor of that trial. It is the first randomized trial in this space, comparing Pulsed Field Ablation with FARAPULSE system against thermal ablation with RS and Cryo. It's an incredibly rigorous design in terms of the endpoints and the monitoring, and we look forward to sharing those results in public. Mike Mahoney : Yeah. To make additional comment on FARAPULSE in the quarter, really pleased to see the increased utilization in Europe. We still have been supply chain constrained with our councils in Europe. So the demand for the platform far exceeds our ability to supply thus far, which we've reported out for a number of quarters in a row. But what's exciting, we just recently received GMED approval for a manufacturing approval to actually manufacture this in Minnesota, where we are here. And so we do anticipate, with the capabilities of the European team and the materials work by the supply chain, that we expect a significant increase in availability of new accounts in the fourth quarter of 2023 and that continuing on in 2024 well in advance of the launch in the U.S. So really proud of the supply chain team in this environment to build this capability internally to meet the demand. And you should expect a number of new centers opening in the fourth quarter, but the utilization is what surprised me. The utilization growth within the served centers in Europe continues to be impressive, which speaks to the performance of the platform. Dan Brennan : And then specific to Investor Day, Joanne, which is coming up here on September 20 for us, I would expect to see what you've seen in past investor days. You'll see the team give us a sense of what we think we can do with our financial goals over the next three years. So a formula, it's worked pretty well for us in our past Investor Days and I would look for us to do the same here in September. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead. Frederick Wise : Good morning, Mike. Hi, Dan. Maybe focusing on the excellent margin performance. Operating margins were particularly stand out and the divisional performance, I mean, MedSurg up 410 basis points, cardiovascular up 240 basis points. Help us understand maybe a little more detail the drivers. Is it volume, is it mix? And to what extent did price play a role? And I'm not quite sure I'm understanding your commentary, Dan, about second half margins as well? Thanks so much. Dan Brennan : Sure. Let me try and put a finer point on that, Rick. So for the first half, we ended at 26.2% operating margin with a real strong 26.8% in the second quarter, which puts us in a good spot for our full year target, which is the 26.4%. Specific to Q2 and the 26.8%, for us, it's always about achieving the overall operating margin goals. And I think history would show that we manage all lines of the P&L pretty well to accomplish that objective. So in any given period, you may see one area of the P&L might contribute more or less. But the ultimate goal is, obviously, to get to that bottom line. And then really specific to Q2, I'm really happy that we got to that 26.8% adjusted operating margin. It's 160 basis points better than last year. And we were also able to accelerate some key SG&A investments to ensure the success of some of those upcoming transformational launches that we have starting here, hopefully, this year with our Cryo launch. So for us, it's always about all areas of the P&L can contribute to the overall operating margin story. Relative to first half, second half, the gross margin, which was a little north of 71% for the first half should be lower in the second half, should be more in line with where we were in the second half of last year, kind of in that 70.5% range for the second half. But the operating margin for the second half will get us -- will be higher than it was in the first half and obviously get us to that 26% goal for the year. The reason for the gross margin being lower in the second half, as we've said, is the FX movements in 2022. So as you go forward, I think lower gross margin in the second half, but higher operating margin in the second half to get to that 26.4%. And one little slight quarterly nuance is, I would expect to see a step down in Q3 relative to that 26.8% that we posted in Q2 and then a step up in Q4 to get to the overall number to get to 26.4% for the year. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of flavor of how we were thinking about it in Q2 and what the second half would bring to get us to that 26.4% for the year. Frederick Wise : Appreciate that Dan. Thanks. Dan Brennan : Sure. Operator : Next question comes from Larry Bison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'll reiterate my congratulations at another strong quarter here. Dr. Stein, on Advent, just using the same definition of success in Advent as manifest, I think the success rate was 74%. So what differences do we need to consider between the two studies and how much do you think those differences could impact the results for FARAPULSE? And separately, what have the success rates been with RF and Cryo in previous studies when using the same criteria as Advent? Sorry for the long question. Just lastly, if FARAPULSE is numerically lower on success or efficacy versus RF and Cryo, how do you think it will impact adoption? Thanks for taking the question. Kenneth Stein : Yeah. Sure, Larry. There's a lot there. Let me start right, again, reinforce to everyone. The definition of \"success\" is very different across a lot of the trials. And Advent, I think, has the most rigorous definition of what constitutes success, frankly, compared to any trial that's ever been done in this space, whether it's PFA or whether it's thermal ablation. And so specifically, right, ADVENT is a randomized trial and that requires patients to have success to have no arrhythmia recurrence, cannot continue taking antiarrhythmic drugs even at doses that had previously failed and cannot be reablated during the so-called three month blanking period after the index ablation. It also includes a very rigorous screening for asymptomatic arrhythmias, including three days of periodic Holter monitoring throughout the of course of the one-year follow-up in the study. I think because of that, there's really no way to make apples-to-apples comparisons across the trials. And the other thing, I'd do in terms of expectation, we'd refer everyone back to the design manuscript for the ADVENT study, which is now published online in Heart Rhythm. And this study was designed around to achieve optimal power around an assumed success rate using this definition of 65% in both the thermal and the FARAPULSE arms. And again, to remind everyone, the studies were powered for non-inferiority. And from our standpoint, then success would constitute a demonstration of non-inferiority both for safety and for efficacy. Larry Biegelsen : Got it. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Travis Steed : Hi. Congrats on a good quarter. Just maybe following up to Larry's question, how would you frame up the commercial opportunity for FARAPULSE for the market growth and share kind of based on the various potential outcomes for ADVENT? And I think you said it the most exciting product launch in your career, but just curious how you think the commercial opportunity frames out based on how ADVENT comes out? And then curious if you've seen the data yet or are you still blinded to the data? Thanks. Mike Mahoney : Yeah. We're obviously very bullish. WATCHMAN has been a pretty amazing product launch as well. Sometimes it gets drowned out in some of these would be continued momentum in that category and the growth of that market. But FARAPULSE is very exciting for us. We've been investing for quite a while post-acquisition to build up manufacturing capabilities, which is the most important thing we could do to meet the demand that we're seeing in Europe and in certain countries in Asia-Pac. So we're very pleased with that milestone. And as I commented earlier, expect to drive a number of new installs in the fourth quarter. I also mentioned just the ongoing increase in utilization. So the physicians who are using that in Europe and selected markets in Asia continue to drive more usage of it, which really is a terrific sign, very similar to what we saw with WATCHMAN throughout that progress. We also have a very strong clinical trial cadence with our persistent trial advantage, which is enrolling very quickly in other trials that we've announced as well as ongoing enhancements of the portfolio. So we have the R&D to continue to strengthen the portfolio, the clinical science studies to continue to advance it, and it's the fastest growing -- one of the fastest-growing fields along with WATCHMAN in MedTech, where we have a very low share. We know it's a very competitive market, but we feel we have many advantages with FARAPULSE and really driving the clinical data in this field and we also have the commercial infrastructure to exploit the opportunity. So we're very bullish on it, and we're looking forward to the ADVENT release. Operator : Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Please go ahead. Danielle Antalffy : Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats to Maulik. He was always a pleasure to work with, if you could pass along my best to him. I'd appreciate it. Thank you so much. And my question is really around just thinking about the back half of the year top line growth guidance. It does organically move higher. And I just want to make sure I understand all the puts and takes there. Obviously, back half of the year does get a little bit tougher from a comp perspective on an organic basis, but does reflect some deceleration. I want to basically understand how much of this is just prudent conservatism on your part, which you guys tend to do versus some real product driven or business driven things we need to consider when looking at the back half? Thanks so much. Dan Brennan : Sure, Danielle. I think I can take that one. If you look at the second half, take the full year of 10% to 11%, which I'm super excited about. I mean they have a fully double-digit range for the full year for organic revenue growth is exciting and I'm proud of that. And when you look at the second half, the guidance we've given for the third quarter is 7% to 9%, so 8% at the midpoint. And then the implied is 7% to 9% for the fourth quarter to get to that, coupled with the first half performance that's what gets you to that 10% to 11% full year result. And I think that's appropriate and prudent guidance with where we are the comps, they're a little harder in the second half. I think it's like 100 basis points harder in the second half than they are in the first half. But overall, I think that 7% to 9% is appropriate, prudent for the second half. And if it gets us to that 10% to 11% for the full year, I think that will be a really successful year, coupled with 80 basis points of margin expansion and EPS growth of 15% to 17%, adjusted EPS for the year, I'd call that a pretty good year for the company. Danielle Antalffy : Great. Thanks so much, Dan. Dan Brennan : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Matthew Taylor : Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Dan, I had one more conceptually on margins, I guess. I wanted to understand some of the key puts and takes for margin expansion going forward. And specifically, I think a lot of investors are focused on inflation kind of abating and the potential for you to get savings on things like freight and lower component costs. Do you think that we could see any of that be good guide (ph) for margins in '24 and beyond, and maybe just speak to the high-level factors there, if you could? Dan Brennan : Sure. I'll start at the kind of the overall operating margin level. So if you say that we achieved the 26.4% adjusted operating margin goal for this year, the good news is there's still a long runway of margin expansion journey for us, well beyond that 26.4%. We've said publicly many times that we believe that 30% plus is a very reasonable target for the company. There's nothing structurally that prevents us from getting there. And to the extent that you have a durably, consistently growing top line, it just gives you a number of leverage opportunities to continue to grow that. So you have that kind of as a backdrop. Specific to areas of the P&L, I think the inflation piece is largely hitting gross margin. And we said that we had the $375 million of impact in '22 versus 2019 in gross margin and, in this year, it's basically stayed relatively consistent. So it's not a headwind or a tailwind versus last year, but obviously, a headwind versus that 72.4% margin that we were in 2019. So specific to your question around what happens going forward, I don't think we'll see a lot of inflationary abatement in '23. I think the guidance that we've given assumes we're kind of in -- we are where we are for the year. But as we look forward to '24 and beyond, yes, I mean, this year, the full year gross margin is -- will be kind of approaching 71% for the year. So that's a gap to where we used to be. And our goal, we're maniacally focused on getting back to that level. We do need some macro help in that, as you mentioned. So some of the elements of it, freight, we do see that getting a little better, the inflationary impact of the cost of the inputs into our manufacturing process, we see that abating over time. And then the consistency of the supply of the materials into our manufacturing process has improved. I mean, frankly, that\u2019s improved, but it\u2019s not back to where it used to be. So we still \u2013 it is choppier than we\u2019d like to see it. And that does impact your ability to really run a really efficient manufacturing process. So I think \u201823 kind of, as I said, we are where we are. When you get to \u201824 and beyond, I think there is an opportunity for gross margin to continue to contribute. Frankly, I think all areas of the P&L can contribute, both areas in OpEx, SG&A and R&D, we can be more efficient. In R&D, we certainly can be more efficient overall in SG&A. And if gross margin can move north of that, approaching 71% that we have for this year, I\u2019m excited about the opportunity for margin expansion going forward. Matthew Taylor : Great. Thanks. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you. Dan Brennan : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Samantha Kurtz : Hi. This is Sam Kurtz on for Matt. Congrats on a great quarter and for taking our question. I guess we would like to touch on the guidance again. And maybe could you tell us a little bit about where you're most excited heading into the second half of the year and where we could potentially see that upside? Mike Mahoney : Yeah. Thank you. I'm trying to be vague. It's as you saw in the first half results, the results are really broad-based across the company and across each region. Excellent growth in Asia Pac and Japan and China, continued share taking in Europe and excellent performance in the U.S. So it's really not one region driving it, which should give investors a lot of confidence in just the momentum and durable growth of the company. The standouts, there are a number of them. You continue to see WATCHMAN performance very strong. That market continues to grow well in excess of 20%. We continue to take a little bit of share in that category. And we're very excited in the future about the launches of the distributable sheets and the next-gen WATCHMAN FLX Pro and the potential of these market-expanding trials, which will read out in a couple of years here. So that platform continues to do very well. Our coronary business did excellent. We're seeing nice results of agents in the U.S. We'll be launching that in 2024, which really reverses any declining trend in drug-eluting stents, and that complex coronary business continues to do well. We saw a great strong growth in PI and endo, euro. We had some softness in our Neuromod business. We anticipate that to get better in the second half. So really, it's a continued momentum. And what we'll highlight at Investor Day is some of the questions we received today. We have some potential very big growth drivers with ongoing WATCHMAN momentum in our entire EP business with the launch of Cryo, which we anticipate in the third quarter this year, and FARAPULSE, which has been discussed at great length. So just good momentum and extremely exciting launches coming that we\u2019ll detail out at Investor Day. Samantha Kurtz : Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Please go ahead. Matthew Miksic : Hey. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on a super strong quarter. So really impressive breaking into double-digits. You are welcome. So Dan, I want to just follow up on cash flows and cash flow conversion and sort of what the puts and takes there have been in the first half? What your expectations are in the back half, and your intermediate long-term goals there? I'm sure you more about at the Analyst Meeting, but anything you can share now? And then also just on cash, if I could. You have so many things going on in that portfolio and in your our clinical programs, but I'd love to get your sort of posture on the business development front and your efforts to find and invest in additional technology and assets? Thanks. Dan Brennan : Sure. So on free cash flow, I'm really happy with Q2. Strong free cash flow quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year. To your point, conversion, it's an area of focus for us, an area of opportunity that has our attention, and one we're looking to improve on as we go forward here. As I've said in the past, there's a couple of kind of key reasons, one of which is our GAAP operating income is lower than some of our peers. We're doing a pretty good job of closing that gap over time, and that will be a key contributor. And then the acquisitive nature of what we do is -- can be a bit of a hamstring there, but I would look for -- as you said, at Investor Day, I'd look for us to give some pretty concrete goals relative to what we think we can do over that LRP period in the next three years to improve the conversion ratio that we have. And again, it\u2019s a focus area for us and something that we will look to improve on going forward. And I think your second question was on cash and M&A, is that fair? Matthew Miksic : Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Dan Brennan : Yes. So I mean our capital allocation strategy has been remarkably consistent, right? It\u2019s all about the number one priority being high-quality tuck-in M&A. It\u2019s still our number one priority. We continue to look at opportunities in conjunction with our financial goals. We have closed two deals this year. The acquisition of Apollo closed in April, and then our acquisition of a stake in Acotec, the Chinese company, closed in February. So we\u2019ve closed a couple this year. We continue to look to be active in the M&A space, and that remains our number one capital allocation priority. Matthew Miksic : Thanks and congrats. Dan Brennan : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Our next question comes from Marie Thibault with BTIG. Please go ahead. Marie Thibault : Hi. Good morning. Nice quarter and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask here on POLARx, the Cryo catheter. You have that coming to the U.S. in the second half of this year. I know it's had pretty great success in Europe, but given some of the supply dynamics happening with FARAPULSE, it sounds like manufacturing will ease there for 47 :16. And the timing of the FARAPULSE launch here in the U.S. How are you thinking about that POLARx launch here in the U.S.? Can that same success be replicated here, do you think? Mike Mahoney : Yes. Thank you. POLARx is doing extremely well in Japan, doing quite well in Europe as well, where we also are selling FARAPULSE, as you indicated. We do not have the constraints on POLARx from a supply standpoint. So the team has been well ahead of that. So there's no limitations there. We do anticipate approval at some point, likely in the third quarter. So we'll have the supply to meet the demand. We have the commercial team in place. And the Cryo market is quite substantial in the U.S. And certainly, doctors are very interested in FARAPULSE, but there's a number of Cryo users there. Some physicians may be looking for even longer-term data on FARAPULSE. So we do see a nice market for Cryo in the coming years. And that's an area that really hasn't seen any innovation in nearly a decade. And so we're excited about what POLARx delivers in terms of differentiating features. Physicians are anxious to try a new platform, and we had the demand to support it. So it's -- we're blessed to have both FARAPULSE coming in the U.S. and Cryo as well as our mapping system to really meet the demands of the electrophysiologists. So we're excited about launching Cryo. Marie Thibault : Okay. Very good. Thanks so much. Mike Mahoney : Yeah. Thanks, Marie. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Patrick Wood : Amazing. Thank you very much for taking the question. I'd love a little bit more detail if you could on the Endo business. Obviously, you did very well in the quarter. There's obviously a lot happening in that business overall. But maybe just giving us a sense of patient volumes relative to share pricing, like any details you can give around their single-use endoscopy, that kind of thing. I'd love any more details, if you could? Thanks. Mike Mahoney : Thanks for the endo question. Just one of our very best businesses in the company, a very global business, a strong contributor to accretive OI margin and grew 12% in the quarter. And consistent with other quarters, on the portfolio, it's quite broad-based. We did see strong procedure volume in the quarter, which is positive. And so I would say the procedure volume overall is quite high in that arena. But still, as mentioned earlier, oftentimes waitlist certainly in the U.S. and in Europe for that business. So we expect ongoing strong demand there. The Apollo acquisition, we're very excited about. The strategy for within endo is we have such a broad-based portfolio with so many SKUs that we are the clear category leader in that area. And we also, as you know, offer very differentiated technologies within that portfolio like SpyGlass, Axios (ph) and now Apollo and also the GESTALT-D (ph) platform. So Apollo also adds this endoluminal suturing capability. The opportunity to expand into the endobariatric market, which we believe will be a high growth area. Certainly, it is in Asia today, in Japan and in the U.S. patients seek a less invasive form to have that bariatric procedure. And it couples nicely with the entire portfolio. So our customers enjoy doing broad-based contracts with our Endo business and the portfolio that we offer, supported by strong procedure volumes. So we'll continue to innovate in that business. And the scopes continue to contribute growth as well. So it's really broad-based across that portfolio. Patrick Wood : Really appreciate it. Thanks for the details. Operator : Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe my first one here, you look at 2023 double-digit organic, that's a pretty big number. Should we worry about comps? When you look at the outlook here, can you just remind us, the plus and minuses from a product perspective, what could be tailwinds, headwinds in fiscal '24? Mike Mahoney : Yeah. So we -- it's good for us to create tough comps. We didn't have an easy comp going into this year. It was about a 9% comp going into '23. So that's a pretty healthy comp. And you indicated what the guidance is. I won't repeat up too many of the other comments. It's broad-based momentum. So growing in that guidance range versus 9% comp is a strong year. And we'll give guidance obviously in January for 2024, and Dan will give some insights to our three-year LRP at Investor Day. And we're really bullish about this next three-year period based on these differentiated launches that based on the current momentum that we have in the business, the product cycle that we have and the opportunity to potentially take it up to another level over a three-year period with these launches, many of which we've been discussed on the call today, many of them coming out of the cardio business. And also the benefit of the margin improvement opportunity that Dan outlined, which we think is a multiyear margin improvement opportunity for us and the increasing strength of the balance sheet. So I think all those areas point to the momentum of the company, but we're excited about really the next chapter of the company, given the cadence of launches that really have been a bit more derisked, I would say, versus a year ago. Vijay Kumar : Understood. That's helpful commentary. Dan, on the margin question, any one-offs that we should be aware of when we think of fiscal '24? Anything on FX, kind of VVP (ph), anything that's outside the normal operating leverage at Boston and Delaware that we should be thinking about? Dan Brennan : Yeah. Obviously, with FX, we'll see where that is when we snap the line when we give guidance. So hard to comment on that now. And then there's always things that happen \u2013 VPP (ph) and other things that happen in every year. So our goal will be to -- we'll hit that 26.4% for this year continue to move that north over the LRP period. And again, as Mike said, look for us to be pretty prescriptive as what we think we can do at our Investor Day upcoming in September. Vijay Kumar : Understood. Thanks, guys. Congrats on the [indiscernible]. Dan Brennan : Thanks. Operator : Our last question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Jayson Bedford : Good morning and thanks for fitting me in. Just touching on an earlier question and trying to break out what's normalized market growth versus, say, a temporary catch-up here. You've grown revenue in the double digits in three of the last four quarters here. So I guess my question is, what do you think end market growth is right now in the markets in which you compete? Mike Mahoney : You've seen others report. So the markets are healthy. There's -- we had a bit tougher comps than some of the others in the second quarter. So we're proud of the growth we had in the second quarter. And we had maybe a bit less easier comp. So the -- we'll further redefine what we think the markets are growing in the future. We call it maybe the -- we would have said 6% to 7%-ish range for our served market growth and maybe that's a bit higher this year. But we still believe that in most of our business units, we're growing faster than our peer group, which is what we're paid to do. So it's a healthy market. And whenever we have a very close pulse with our customers and the hospitals that have -- the big hospital systems who have already announced earnings, they have very healthy demand, but we see an ongoing patient backlog for lack of a -- patient wait time. So we don't see the current demand abating. Oftentimes, you'll see a bit of a slowdown in some of the vacation months in August and so forth, which is very routine. But we do anticipate continued support from strong procedure volume in the coming years. We don't see that really abating. Jayson Bedford : Helpful. Thank you. Lauren Tengler : Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific. If we were unable to get to your question or if you have any follow-ups, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Before you disconnect, Kyle will give you all of the pertinent details for the replay.

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lauren Tengler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Lauren Tengler : Thank you, Costas. Welcome everyone, and thanks for joining us today. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q2 2023 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations on the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials & Filings. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike and Dan will provide comments on Q3 performance, as well as the outlook for our business, including Q4 and full-year 2023 guidance. Then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike, and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales. Relevant acquisitions and divestitures excluded for organic growth are Baylis Medical, which closed on February 14, 2022, the majority stake investment in Acotec Scientific, and Apollo Endosurgery, which closed in February and April of this year, respectively. Divestitures include the endoscopy pathology business, which closed April of this year. Please note that we have elected to consolidate Acotec results on a one quarter lag, which had been included in our Q3 reported and adjusted results. Guidance excludes the previously announced agreement to acquire Relievant Medsystems, which is expected to close in the first half of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. For more information, please refer to our financial and operating highlights deck, which may be found on our Investor Relations website. On this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified, are organic. This call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, may, believe, estimate, and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth in market share, new and anticipated product approvals and launches, acquisitions, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend, and other expenses. If our underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect, or if certain risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike. Mike Mahoney : Well done, Lauren. Thank you, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased with another quarter of excellent results, with momentum continuing fueled by new product innovation, clinical evidence, and our talented teams across the globe. Q3 \u201923, total company sales grew 11% operationally and 10% organically versus Q3 \u201822, which exceeds the high end of our guidance range of 7% to 9%. This performance is a testament to our category leadership strategy, focus on innovation, and strong commercial execution. We believe that most of our global business units grew in line or faster than the respective markets. Q3 adjusted EPS at $0.50 grew 15% versus Q3 \u201822, which exceeds the high end of the guidance range of $0.46 to $0.48. Q3 adjusted operating margin was 26.1%, slightly higher than anticipated. Now, for \u201823 guidance, we're guiding to Q4 \u201823 organic revenue growth of 8% to 10%, and aligning our full-year organic guidance to approximately 11%, the high end of our prior guidance. Our Q4 \u201823 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.49 to $0.52, and we are raising our full-year adjusted EPS range to $1.99 to $2.02.  I'll now provide additional highlights on Q3, along with comments on our 2023 outlook, and then Dan will provide more details on the financials. Regionally, on an operational basis, the US grew 9% versus Q3 \u201922, driven by strong performance within our WATCHMAN, EP, endo, and urology businesses. Europe, Middle East, and Africa grew 11% on an operational basis versus Q3 \u201822. Performance of the region was broad-based, with double-digit growth in seven out of our eight business units. Within the quarter, we saw strong growth in EP, with ongoing momentum and demand for FARAPULSE and POLARx. Asia Pac grew 19% operationally versus third quarter \u201922, led by strength in Japan and China. Japan grew strong double digits in the quarter, with ongoing momentum from new products, most notably AGENT DCB, Rez\u016bm, POLARx FIT, and WATCHMAN FLX. Physician demand for our differentiated AGENT DCB remains high, and we've taken a market leadership position within the quarter after launching earlier this year. Double-digit growth in China was led by our Imaging and Complex PCI portfolio, as well as the commercial execution of the team more broadly. These results were further supported by the performance of the Acotec business, and we continue to expect double-digit growth in China for the full year.  I'll now provide some additional commentary on the business units. In the quarter, urology sales grew 11% organically, with international growth of 18%, fueled by new products and globalization efforts, with all regions outside the US growing double digits. Globally, the Stone Management franchise grew double digits, driven by LithoVu and Laser Therapies. Rez\u016bm had another strong quarter of double-digit growth, backed by long-term clinical data supporting international momentum with a leave nothing behind message resonating in Asia. Endoscopy sales grew 11% organically and 12% operationally versus third quarter \u201922, broad-based strength across all regions. Our single-use imaging and AXIOS technologies continued to perform well, both doing double digits within the quarter. And earlier this month, we received US marketing authorization for an expanded indication of the AXIOS stent to include gallbladder drainage, increasing access to more patients with this platform. Neuromodulation sales grew 3% organically versus third quarter \u201822. Our Brain franchise grew low double digits in the quarter, with strength from new product launches, including the Vercise Neural Navigator 5 Software, which is our fifth generation DBS programming solution, furthering our leadership in image-guided programming for more streamlined DBS programming in the US.  Our pain business grew low single digits, driven by spinal cord stimulation sales, which were slightly below our expectations. We're optimistic about the opportunities ahead of our pain business included in our recent US approval to expand indication of our WaveWriter Alpha SCS system to include DPN, which is expected to launch in early \u201824. We're also excited to add to our portfolio with our recently announced agreement to acquire Relievant Medsystems and its Intracept procedure. Intracept is the only US-cleared system for vertebrogenic pain, expanding our portfolio of pain offerings, which is expected to close in the first half of 2024. Peripheral intervention sales grew 8% organically and 13% operationally, which includes the results of Acotec versus third quarter \u201922. Our Arterial franchise delivered another strong quarter, growing low double digits, led by ongoing success globally with our drug-eluting portfolio. in Venous, data from the REAL-PE study was presented earlier this week, demonstrating statistically significant lower major bleeding rates in patients with pulmonary embolism who are treated with EKOS compared to a competitive mechanical thrombectomy device. The REAL-PE study analyzed nearly real-time EHR data for over 2,200 PE patients from 2009 to 2023. This study provides new clinical evidence for providers in determining the optimal modality for each patient's needs. Our Interventional Oncology franchise grew double digits, including ongoing momentum with our Embold Coil, launch as well as strong demand for our cancer therapies. Within the quarter, we received FDA clearance to expand the indication of the Visual ICE Cryoablation System to treat pain associated with tumors that have metastasized to bone in patients who are unable to receive standard radiation therapy. Our cardiology group delivered another excellent quarter, with organic sales growth of 11% versus third quarter \u201822. Within cardiology, interventional cardiology therapy sales grew 7% organically versus third quarter \u201822. Our Structural Heart Valves franchise grew double digits in third quarter, led by ACURATE Neo2 sales performance in Europe. And growth within our Coronary Therapies franchise is fueled by ongoing success of our Imaging technologies. We're pleased to have received clearance for the AVVIGO+ Guidance System. AVVIGO is our next-generation platform that provides high quality fast imaging, with improved physiologic assessment of coronary vessels and lesions. We continue to be pleased with the performance of AGENT DCB in Japan. Importantly, our AGENT IDE trial results were presented yesterday as a late breaker at TCT, with data demonstrating statistical superiority of the AGENT drug-coated balloon versus uncoated balloon angioplasty for the treatment of patients with in-stent restenosis. With our recent regulatory submission to FDA, we anticipate approval of AGENT, the first drug-coated balloon indicated for the coronary arteries within the US in the second half of \u201924. WATCHMAN sales grew 23% organically versus third quarter \u201822. We're very pleased with the excellent performance of this franchise, and have now treated more than 350,000 patients globally. Last month, we received FDA approval of the latest generation WATCHMAN FLX Pro, which is designed to improve visualization during device placement to enhance healing post-implant, and treat a broader range of patient anatomies. Additionally, enrollment has commenced in HEAL-LAA, a post-market study of the WATCHMAN FLX Pro device in the US. We continue to expect strong growth from the WATCHMAN, business backed by new technologies and significant investment in clinical evidence.  Cardiac rhythm management sales grew 5% organically versus third quarter \u201922. And core CRM, our high voltage business, grew low single digits, and our low voltage business grew mid-single digits. Our Diagnostics franchise grew double digits in the quarter, fueled by our diverse portfolio of ambulatory ECGs and ICM. We continue to further innovate in the space, having launched in the US the next-generation LUX-Dx II and the II+ implantable cardiac monitor for long-term monitoring of arrhythmias, providing enhanced diagnostic capabilities and enabling a more efficient workflow. Electrophysiology sales grew 27% organically versus third quarter \u201822. International growth of 33% was driven by excellent performance from our differentiated FARAPULS and POLARx technologies, as well as our Access Solutions franchise and the leading VersaCross Access platform. US growth of 22% was led by our Access Solutions franchise, along with contribution from the early approval - I'm sorry, from the approval of the POLARx Cryoablation System, including POLARx FIT, which enables physicians to adjust and expand the cryo balloon to best fit a patient's individual anatomy. Also, within the quarter, we launched VersaCross Connect for POLARSHEATH, which provides safe and efficient access to the left side of the heart during procedures, expanding our Access Solutions portfolio. Clinical evidence generation remains a key priority, and we're pleased to have completed enrollment in the first phase of the ADVANTAGE AF clinical trial studying FARAPULSE for the treatment of patients with persistent AFib. Additionally, we commenced enrollment and treated our first patient in an extension arm of the ADVANTAGE study to evaluate FARAPOINT, which is a point-by-point PFA focal catheter for CTI ablations used to treat atrial flutter. Finally, within the quarter, we achieved important milestones to bring in our leading PFA technology to the US. Recalled data from our ADVENT IDE trial was presented at ESC at the end of August, comparing FARAPULSE to standard of care thermal modalities meeting the primary endpoints. We've also completed our US regulatory submission and continue to anticipate the approval of FARAPULSE in the US in the second half of \u201924.  Through the first nine months of this year, we have grown organic sales 12% while growing adjusted EPS 18%, with broad-based growth across all of our business units and regions. This performance is supportive of the goal we laid out last month at our Investor Day, where we aspire to be highest performing large cap med tech company over the next three years. We believe our focus and talent and culture, our relentless pursuit of innovation, while doing the right thing for society and operating responsibly, sets us up to deliver a unique set of financial goals over the 2024 to 2026 long range period. Our LRP goals include growing sales 8% to 10% CAGR over the period, while expanding adjusted rate operating margins by 150 basis points over the three years, with double-digit adjusted EPS growth annually, and improvement of our free cash flow conversion to approximately 70% by 2026. With that, I'll pass off to Dan to provide more details on the financials. Dan Brennan : Thanks, Mike. Third quarter 2023 consolidated revenue of $3,527 million, represents 11.2% reported revenue growth versus third quarter 2022, and includes a 10 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange, which was lower than expected due to the strengthening of the US dollar throughout the quarter. Excluding this $4 million tailwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 11.1% in the quarter. Sales from acquisitions and divestitures contributed 90 basis points, resulting in 10.2% organic revenue growth, exceeding our guidance range of 7% to 9%. Q3 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 grew 15% versus 2022, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.46 to $0.48, driven predominantly by our strong sales performance. Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 70.2%, slightly lower than our expectations, primarily driven by foreign exchange. In light of our Q3 results, we now anticipate that full-year 2023 adjusted gross margin will only slightly improve on a year-over-year basis.  Strong sales performance drove third quarter adjusted operating margin of 26.1%, resulting in a year-to-date adjusted operating margin also of 26.1%. Our year-to-date performance sets us up well to achieve our full-year 2023 adjusted operating margin goal of approximately 26.4%, which represents 80 basis points of expansion versus 2022.On a GAAP basis, the third quarter operating margin was 19.6%, which includes a $111 million credit primarily related to certain IP litigation matters. Moving to below the line, third quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $81 million, which was in line with our expectations. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the third quarter was 12.4%, favorable to our expectations, driven by certain discreet tax items in the quarter. Our operational tax rate was 13.9%, in line with expectations. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1,475 million in Q3. Free cash flow for the quarter was $509 million, with $698 million from operating activities, less $190 million net capital expenditures. Excluding special items, adjusted free cash flow was $582 million. As a result of our strong year-to-date adjusted free cash flow generation, we now expect full-year 2023 adjusted free cash flow in excess of $2.4 billion.  Our top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A, followed by annual share purchases to offset dilution from employee stock grants, which we announced at last month's Investor Day. As of September 30, 2023, we had cash on hand of $952 million, and our gross debt leverage was 2.3 times.  I'll now walk through guidance for Q4 and full-year 2023. We expect full-year 2023 operational revenue growth to be approximately 12%, which excludes an approximate 100 basis-point headwind from foreign exchange, higher than our previous estimate due to the strengthening of the US dollar. Excluding the impact of closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect full-year 2023 organic revenue growth to be approximately 11% versus 2022. We expect fourth quarter 2023 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 9% to 11% versus Q3 2022, with a neutral impact from foreign exchange based on current rates. Excluding the contribution from closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect fourth quarter 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 8% to 10%. We continue to expect our full-year 2023 adjusted below the line expenses to be approximately $340 million. Our full-year 2023 operational tax rate is now expected to be approximately 13.5% under current legislation and forecasted geographic mix of sales. As a result of a lower operational tax rate and favorable discrete items recognized in the third quarter, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 12%. We expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,478 million shares for Q4 2023, and 1,464 million shares for the full year 2023. We expect full-year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.99 to $2.02, representing 17% to 18% growth versus 2022. We continue to anticipate a neutral impact from foreign exchange on full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share. We expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.49 to $0.52. For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q3 2023 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q3 results and 2023 guidance.  In closing, I'm very proud of our year-to-date financial performance, with top-tier organic revenue growth of 12%, adjusted operating margin of 26.1%, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 18%. I look forward to continued momentum in the fourth quarter to close out 2023, which will set the stage towards achieving our long-range financial goals.  With that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A. Lauren Tengler : Thanks, Dan. Costas, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. In order for us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Costas, please go ahead. Operator : [Operator instructions]. And the first question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Robbie Marcus : Hi, good morning. And congrats on a great quarter. And since many of us are at TCT, I'll add the nice AGENT DCB trial as well. I had two questions, so I'm going to - I'll just go with one here. As we go back to the Analyst Day, you pointed to 8% to 10% growth and 150 basis points of operating margin expansion over the three-year timeframe. And I believe one of the comments was at the beginning of the range, it'll be towards the lower end and accelerate as you have some of your big new product launches coming. So, I'm looking at 2024 here and I see the Street at 8% to 9% organic sales growth and about 50 basis points margin expansion. I just want to make sure we're interpreting the comments you made at t he Analyst Day correctly, and any thoughts you have on directionality for next year. Thanks a lot. Mike Mahoney : Yes, sure. Robbie. I think relative to the Analyst Day commentary, let me just reiterate just to make sure we're all on the same page. So, yes, as you said, 8% to 10% organic revenue growth over the period, 2024 to 2026, 150 basis points of margin expansion over that three-year period, which would put us, assuming we're at that 26.4% at the end of this year, kind of near that 28%, which is a nice jumping off point for that 30% long-term goal. And then we said that the 2025 revenue growth rate would likely be higher than our 2024 revenue growth rate due to the launches that are coming in 2024. So, that's really the commentary that we had relative to Investor Day. And obviously, 2023 is shaping up to be a great year, good jumping off point heading into 2024. But relative to specifics around 2024, we're working through our 2024 annual planning process here in the fourth quarter. And as you would expect, we'll use that as the basis to give you the guidance when we get to our Q4 earnings call in January. Robbie Marcus : All right, appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. Since many are sitting here at TCT, I think I'm going to focus on that, including, I'd love some feedback on the data that's been presented here, particularly on the AGENT trial. And then I found the WATCH-TAVR Trial also interesting. So, anything you can comment on, that would be wonderful. Thank you. Mike Mahoney : Dr. Stein, you want to comment? Dr. Ken Stein : Yes, thanks, Mike. Let me start again. Hey Joanne. We\u2019re really pleased by all of the data that we saw at TCT. I'll begin with AGENT, and literally could not be happier with the ultimate results of that randomized trial, which again, as I hope everyone recognizes, right, is intended to get approval of the first drug-coated balloon indicated for use in the coronaries in the United States for in-stent restenosis, right? In-stent restenosis accounts for approximately 10% of US coronary interventions today. Having a drug-coated balloon will allow interventionalists to address these stent failures while leaving nothing behind. We've seen how well it's performing where we do have it approved in Japan. And just to reiterate really the incredible results from the trial met endpoint of target lesion failure at 12 months was really marked statistical and clinical superiority to Plano balloon angioplasty, and importantly, both clinically important reductions in target-vessel-MI, and reductions in the need for target lesion revascularization. And then - yes, so that was yesterday. Day before yesterday, we saw the results of WATCH-TAVR. And so, WATCH-TAVR, I think, was an important investigator-initiated trial looking at the combined use of the legacy WATCHMAN 2.5 device at the same time of TAVR in high risk patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing TAVR. And I think on the one hand, we sort of acknowledge that combined use of WATCHMAN with TAVR does face a challenge in reimbursement environment, but also important, the trial validates the safety and the efficacy of the legacy WATCHMAN 2.5 device as compared to control therapy, including the use of NOACs in this population. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from a line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead. Rick Wise : Good morning. Thank you for the question and it's wonderful to see such an excellent quarter. I guess if I focus on one, maybe you could expand on your - Mike, on your - if you want to do it, your neuromod comments, just your latest thinking, just broadly what's going to help re-accelerate the business or what's next from here. But more specifically, the PDN indication approval, how does that affect the business? When does it start contributing? How would you have us think about the beneficial contribution there? Thanks a lot. Mike Mahoney : Thanks. Morning, Rick. In the third quarter, as I mentioned, we're proud that most all of our businesses grew, at least, at most likely, most of them grew above market, likely, with the exception of the one that you asked about, neuromod. So, in the neuromod business, we grew roughly 3% in the quarter. I'll just start off, before you - I jumped SCS, the brain business. Our DBS business continues to do well, continues to grow share. And in third quarter, it grew double digits again with the neural navigator. So, that business continues to become a larger part of the overall mix. Global SCS still is the largest piece. That's been under pressure, as you pointed out. The pressure points really come from additional - probably a couple of new competitors to the marketplace, some competitive launches, and our DPN approval, which we're very excited about, which you highlighted, we received in October, but we don't expect to launch our DPN platform until likely first quarter, near the mid first quarter of 2024. So, this will certainly help us with our core SCS business with that additional indication. And also, with the Relievant company that we've signed but not yet closed, we expect to close that in 2024. So, we need the combination of the DPN through our existing SCS base, combining with the Relievant, and also our RF platform gives us a really nice category leadership position to treat pain with a variety of options, which will be differentiated. So, we do expect likely some softness to continue in the fourth quarter, and we obviously aim to improve on those results in 2024 based on what I just highlighted. Rick Wise : Appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys, congrats on the print and the data being presented at TCT. If I may, I want to stick to on the financial side. Dan, just to clarify the 2024 commentary, if the acceleration is all being driven by new products, and these new products are being launched, I think you said back half of next year, should we be perhaps thinking about the lower end of that 8% to 10%? And I think you mentioned gross margins FX impact here. So, it looks like Q4 is going to look similar to 3Q. How to think about any FX impact from gross margins as we look at the outlook. Dan Brennan : Sure. So, I\u2019ll hit the gross margin one first. The gross margin in the third quarter was a little bit lower than we expected, and it was predominantly driven by FX, that 70.2%. So, we had been targeting kind of to be approaching 71% for the full year this year. We were 70.5 last year. Just tempering that commentary to say you know what, we might not hit the approaching 71%. We might be - we'll be north of 70.5, but maybe not as high as approaching 71%. So, a bit of a nuance there, but driven by FX. And we had mentioned for - the long range plan at Investor Day for 2024, 2025, and 2026, that there'd be a bit of an FX headwind in gross margin in 2024 that should get better over that timeframe of 2024, 2025, 2026. Relative to 2024 organic revenue growth, no, there's really not much to assume other than we'll let you know on January 31 when we have our call. We have 8% to 10% as the CAGR for the three years. As I mentioned, we'll work through our annual planning process here over the back half of this quarter, and we'll let you know. We do have some nice launches, obviously in 2024, as you mentioned, many in the back half, but we'll let you know on January 31 what we think the range will be for 2024. Vijay Kumar : Understood. Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Congrats on the print. Mike, we've made it this far without GLP-1 question, but I'm going to ask it anyway. Obviously, diabetes and obesity are risk factors for many diseases such as cardiovascular disease. So, how are you thinking about the potential long-term impact of GLP-1s on your businesses, and any high level thoughts, Mike, on how investors have reacted to GLP-1s in general? Thank you. Mike Mahoney : Dr. Stein, you want to give our comment on GLP-1? Dr. Ken Stein : Yes, thanks, Mike, and hey, good morning, Larry. I think I'm going to begin, right, I mean, as a doc, I think you have to acknowledge these are promising agents. I think on the other hand, as a doc and a realist who's lived through the launch of other promising agents in the past, and I think statins are a really good example, I think you\u2019ve got to acknowledge, and particularly these drugs, given issues of cost, issues of convenience and issues of tolerability, we expect it will take at least a decade to reach peak penetration of these drugs in the indicated population. And even after a decade, we expect that only a minority of American patients with obesity will be taking these drugs. But if you think about these barriers to usage, I begin by saying, we see very limited short-term impact on cardiovascular disease, and even in the long-term, right, our analysis, taking into account, again, penetration ramp of these drugs, as I said, and taking into account what we know this far, thus far, about a reported 20% reduction in cardiovascular event rates, suggests to us that the impact on US coronary and peripheral procedure volumes will be minor even at peak. And I think it's important to state. So, we, even with these drugs, continue to expect both of these procedures to continue to grow in volume over the next decade. First of all, I think it's also really important to point out that cardiovascular disease is a global issue, that there is less attribution to obesity in other regions, particularly Asia, making it less amenable to prevention with these drugs, which are frankly also very likely to be less accessible outside of the US. Also, any decrease in cardiovascular mortality and events will necessarily be accompanied by a corresponding increase in the prevalence of other diseases that are associated with aging, diseases in areas that are really very well served by our products, including things like cardiac pacing, interventional oncology for many forms of cancer, deep brain stimulation. And finally, right, the assumptions that I'm talking to in terms of our modeling, right, don't consider other procedural growth factors like an aging population over this period, and certainly doesn't consider the long track record that we have of focusing and executing on innovation. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks, Dr. Stein. Operator : The next question is from the line of Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Travis Steed : Hey, thanks for taking the question. I did want to ask about FARAPULSE. It sounded like the update was expected approval in second half 2024. Just curious when that was filed with the FDA. And maybe talk a little bit about scaling that up in the US and the potential to see pull-through on the ancillary products like mapping. Lauren Tengler : Maybe you take the timing of launch, and you can speak to the value to the full portfolio. Dr. Ken Stein : Yes, sure, Lauren. So, yes, on timing, again, as we said, I think everyone knows, right, our foundational pivotal scale data to submit to the FDA was ADVENT. Presented those results, as Mike said at, ESC, the end of August, with simultaneous publication in New England Journal of Medicine. Hit all of our endpoints, very clean data set. And so, again, as we've said, we've now completed our regulatory submission to the FDA and things are in the regulator's hands. So, continue to expect approval second half of next year. And I think all of the EPs that I've spoken to in the US can't wait to get their hands on it. Mike Mahoney : Yes. You saw the results in the third quarter, which are quite strong with both POLARx and FARAPULSE. I think what's important is our supply chain team has done a terrific job over the past 18 months in building supply of both catheters and the capital equipment needed. So, we expect to see a more significant install cadence to the back half of this quarter and into first quarter. So, we feel like we've really significantly improved our supply capabilities, and you'll see that in 2024 in Europe, and we'll be ready for the US launch. Travis Steed : Great. Thanks a lot for the question. Congrats on the good quarter. Operator : The next question is from the line of Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Please go ahead. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. And congrats on a great quarter and the data here at TCT. Just a quick question on Q4 topline guide. I imagine there's some conservatism baked in here, but if I'm looking at it correctly, is implying a little bit of a deceleration, and not to be nitpicky here, but just want to make sure we're understanding of what the tailwinds versus headwinds are as we go into Q4 and heading into 2024. Thanks so much. Dan Brennan : Sure, Danielle. Yes, I think of note, if you think back to our July guidance, obviously we didn't give specific Q4 guidance, but implied in that guidance would've been 7% to 9%. So, the 8% to 10% that we have for the fourth quarter is a bit of acceleration from where that would've been. As always, we think the 8% to 10% is a prudent number for the quarter, and believe it's the right number for the quarter for - to close out the year. It'll put us at 11%, approximately 11% organic revenue growth for the year. So, I think that's a great year for the company. And you combine that with the other metrics that we have, not just revenue, but the 11% organic revenue growth, you'd see 80 basis points of margin expansion at that 26.4% adjusted op margin. And then you get to 17% to 18% full-year EPS at that $1.99 to kind of that milestone over $2 to get to that $2.02. That's a good year. Danielle Antalffy : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Matt Taylor : Hi, thanks for taking the question. I actually wanted to ask one on neuromodulation. You talked about results below expectations in light of competitive dynamics. So, I was hoping you could comment on that and whether you expect any improvement in growth now that you have the PDN indication. Mike Mahoney : Sure, Matt. Yes, there's been a couple of new entrants into the field over the last 12 months. And so, they've taken a little bit of market share. Overall, the market's likely, I don't know, 5% to 6%-ish, and this year we're likely to - in SCS US, likely be below the market. I mentioned earlier, a big driver there is not having the support of DPN, which we just recently received in October. And we expect to be able to offer that capability in line with some of our competitors in first quarter 2024. So, we do expect to have a softer fourth quarter, and then we expect acceleration improvement in 2024 versus 2023 for our SCS business and our Brain business. DBS continues to take share and grow double digits, and again, mentioned it's likely the only division that's grown below the market. Matt Taylor : Great. Thanks, Mike. Operator : The next question is from the line of Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Josh Jennings : Hi, good morning. Congratulations on the strong results, and wanted to follow up on Travis's question on FARAPULSE. Was hoping to just better understand where your US EP sales force stands today and how you're building that out, your plan to build that out and for the FARAPULSE launch. And then just on top of that, just thinking about the full integration of FARAPULSE and arrhythmia and developing these FARAVIEW capabilities, is there anything of note that we should be thinking about that would provide clinical advantages that could catalyze stronger demand for arrhythmia once that integration is completed, I believe at the year-end of 2024? Thanks for taking the questions. Mike Mahoney : Sure. Yes. I won't go into all too many specifics on our commercial strategy. We do have a scaled and trained EP sales force, as you imagine, given the capabilities we have with our WATCHMAN division and our EP business and our CRM business. So, we have a scaled EP force that's been trained up now, and what's great to see is they're successfully selling cryo today. So, having the approval of that, and we had a really nice initial, I don't know, 30 days or so of cryo openings. So, we expect to see cryo to be a nice revenue driver force in 2024 as we wait for the FARAPULSE approval. So, we do have a scaled, highly capable EP commercial team. And Ken, if you want to comment on the arrhythmia offerings. Dr. Ken Stein : Yes. Thanks, Josh. And again, we're very excited about FARAPULSE as it stands today. So, we have disclosed, we do have a next generation of FARAWAVE catheter, right, which is the ablation catheter part of the FARAPULSE system that will include an embedded NAV sensor that will work with a novel iteration to the arrhythmia software that we're calling FARAVIEW that we do have targeted for year-end of 2024. And our goal here really, Josh, is, I said, we're never going to compel people to use arrhythmia if they want to use FARAPULSE, but we're going to make the FARAWAVE and FARAVIEW system compelling for physicians to use. And there are really some very novel things that we're able to do with that system combination that we believe is going to improve physician workflow and hopefully lead to even better patient outcomes with the combined system, even on top of the great outcomes that we saw in ADVENT. Josh Jennings : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question is from the line of Chris Pasquale with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. ChrisPasquale: Thanks. I had a follow-up for Dr. Stein on AGENT. The results were certainly impressive versus PTA, but it was noted from the podium that about 85% of ISR cases in the US today are being treated with drug-eluting stents. So, do you have plans to follow up the IDE study with a randomized trial versus DES? And maybe just some thoughts on how you see AGENT fitting into the treatment paradigm versus that standard of care. Dr. Ken Stein : Yes, Chris, I\u2019m not going to get into what our post-approval research strategy is going to look like. I think that there's a lot to be learned when you see how drug-coated balloons are used in Japan and how they're used in Europe today, right? And patients with in-stent restenosis have failed the stent. And fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I don't think that there are a lot of physicians who want to be putting additional foreign objects into someone who's already had in-stent restenosis. So, we really believe the results that we saw with AGENT are compelling and compelling enough to move the vast majority of interventionalists to use AGENT in place of either Plano balloon angioplasty or in place of, again, yet another stent in the in-stent restenosis area. I think the only other thing I'll say is, clearly there are a lot of potential indications for the use of the AGENT product beyond in-stent restenosis, and we'll certainly be looking at research into all of those as we get beyond approval and use for the first indication. ChrisPasquale: That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from the line of Mike Polark with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Mike Polark : Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I have a question on price-cost. On price, the message has been historically we were kind of a little negative. We've moved it at the portfolio level to neutral. As we jump into 2024, what's a good base case? Neutral, again, a little up, a little down. On the cost side, kind of where are you seeing opportunities, raw materials, freight, labor, where are you seeing tensions? And then the last piece of this is, one of your large competitors did announce an inventory obsolescence charge this quarter. I think we all can see that inventories for the sector overall are quite higher than they used to be because of the COVID stresses and strains. Can I get an update on Boston's status on inventory? Thank you. Dan Brennan : Sure, Mike. Happy to. A lot in that question. So, on the pricing, historically, we've been in that kind of very low single-digit decline for many years. We're starting to envision a world where we could be flat. So, that's a goal of ours as we go forward over the LRP to get to flat pricing, which obviously helps revenue and helps all the way down through the rest of the P&L. On the cost side, as you look at the traditional areas that we've talked about that have been impacted over the past couple of years, when you take freight, I'd say that's gotten better, but it's certainly not back to where it was. So, I'd say improving, but still elevated. And obviously, the conflict in the Middle East has us focused on fuel and oil, as that runs the risk of increasing off of that. The inflation impact on our direct material costs, again, I would say, this seems - we're seeing signs of that stabilizing over time, but it's absolutely elevated from where it was. So, we still do see impact there. And then the consistency of supply, it's not fully back to normal again, but it has improved. So, we're optimistic about the future that we see a better macro environment for cost of goods in that category, but we're not there yet, is what I would say. And then relative to inventory, yes, I mean, I would say, we've been building inventory over the last two or three years, right? Our back order has been elevated higher than we have liked. The team's done a great job over the last 12 months of getting that more in line with where you\u2019ve been historically. So, I would not point to EE&O charges from our perspective as a big driver because we're still a bid and catch-up mode and making sure that we have the right amount of inventory to supply. So, I think we're focused on having the right inventory, but we're not at the point where we have too much inventory. Operator : Mr. Polark, have you finished with your questions? Mike Polark : Yes. Thank you. Lauren Tengler : Yes. Can we take the last question? Operator : The next - our last question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Matthew O'Brien: Morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I know you guys are a domestic company, but the performance in EMEA and APAC specifically were notable, and specifically APAC was really, really strong this quarter. Can you just give us a little more sense for - because I think those two collectively were roughly half your growth this quarter. The durability of the performance in those geographies, is it a function of just more and more products into those areas, and so that's pretty straightforward, or is it share taking that's required, or what's really required to continue to deliver, maybe not this level of growth, which is really strong again, but a very strong growth going forward where that's a significant contributor to the topline for 2024, 2025 and beyond? Thanks. Mike Mahoney : Sure. Yes, starting with Europe is really not a - thankfully, it's not a new phenomenon for our team in Europe, which we also were referencing. Middle East, Africa, last year they grew 12%, and they're on track to grow another double digits again in 2023. So, the European team, it's really a combination clearly of share-taking given the markets aren't growing double digits in Europe. And our European team has benefited from the portfolio of having many of the product launches that were talked about for second half of 2024 in the US already in that marketplace. So, they're doing an excellent job of launching our innovative products, taking share in the more developed western European markets, and also building a pretty significant capability in the appropriate emerging markets in Europe. That also grows double digits. So, the team's just done a really nice job of executing and driving our innovation with the launches. Asia Pac had another strong quarter this year. That region also will grow double digits, grew double digits last year and double digits again this year. And I would say, the new news here is really just the strength of Japan is excellent in the quarter, and we expect another strong quarter for them in the fourth quarter. Again, it's all back to our people and our portfolio, and the team in Japan launching POLARx AGENT, AVVIGO will be the next platform to launch in Japan. So, that team's done a really nice job. In China, I was just there for about a week, and that team continues to grow nicely, strong double digits, despite all the challenges that are well known in the marketplace, again, based on the strength of our portfolio, some of the alliances that we're doing, and our team in China is quite strong. So, they continue to - so it's not a new event for us this quarter. Those regions have been delivering that for quite some time. Lauren Tengler : Thanks, Mike. And thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific. If we were unable to get to your question, or if you have any follow-up, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team.

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lauren Tengler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Lauren Tengler : Thank you, Drew. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q4 and full year 2023 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials & Filings. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike and Dan will provide comments on Q4 and full year performance, as well as the outlook for the business including 2024 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on this call, operational revenue growth, excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales. Relevant acquisitions and divestitures excluded for organic growth are Baylis Medical, which closed on February 14th, 2022; the majority stake investment in Acotec Scientific Holdings Limited, Apollo Endosurgery and Relievant Medical, which closed in February, April, November 2023, respectively. Divestitures include the Endoscopy Pathology business, which closed in April 2023. Guidance excludes the previously announced agreement to acquire Axonics, Inc., which is expected to close in the first half of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. For more information, please refer to our financial and operating highlights deck, which may be found on our Investor Relations website. On this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified, are organic. This call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, may, believe, estimate, and other similar words. They include among other things, statements about our growth in market share, new and anticipated product approvals and launches, acquisitions, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. If our underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect, or if certain risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike. Michael Mahoney : Thanks, Lauren, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. 2023 results were excellent, and our global performance represented one of the strongest years in company history, exceeding our financial goals that we set for the year. This performance is fueled by innovation and clinical evidence generation, commercial execution, and the winning spirit of our global teams. In fourth quarter '23, total company operational sales grew 15%. Our organic sales grew 14% versus fourth quarter '22, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of 8% to 10%. Full-year '23 operational sales growth of 13% versus 2022, while organic sales grew 12%, exceeding our guidance of approximately 11% for the full year. Importantly, six of our eight business units grew sales double-digit in the fourth quarter and double-digits for the full year 2023. And all of our regions also grew double-digits in the fourth quarter and double-digits full year 2023. This performance is a testament to our category leadership strategy and our focus on innovation bolstered by commercial excellence. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS at $0.55 grew 24% versus 2022, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.49 to $0.52. Full year adjusted EPS of $2.05, grew 20% versus 2022, also exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $1.99 to $2.02. Q4 adjusted operating margin was 26.6% and full year '23 was 26.3%, which is exciting because it exceeds pre-pandemic levels. We generated a full year cash flow of $1.8 billion and adjusted free cash flow of $2.5 billion in line with our expectations. Now for our 2024 outlook. We expect healthy procedure volumes to continue and our guidance to organic growth of seven to nine for the first quarter of '24, and eight to nine for the full year of 2024. Our Q1'24 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.50 to $0.52. We expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $2.23 to $2.27, representing growth of 9% to 11%. This guidance excludes the acquisition of Axonics, which is expected to close in the first half of '24. Despite pressures on margins in '24 from FX headwinds, as well as investments in manufacturing capacity and selling expenses to fuel our exciting launches, we remain committed to improving operating income margins in 2024 and to our goal of improving adjusted operating margin by 150 basis points in '24 to '26. Now, Dan will provide more details on those financials for both 2023 and 2024. I'll now provide additional highlights on '23 results along with comments on our outlook. Regionally on an operational basis, the US grew 11% for the fourth quarter of '22. Full year 2023 grew 10% with particular strength in our Watchman, EP, Endo and Uro business units. Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 12% on an operational basis versus Q4 '22 and 13% on a full year basis. This above-market growth is supported by new and ongoing product launches across the portfolio, price discipline and strong commercial execution. We're excited about the year ahead with ongoing momentum across the region, particularly with our innovative EP portfolio and further opportunity in our growth in emerging markets within the EMEA region. Asia Pacific grew 17% operationally versus Q1 in '19 versus the full year 2022 with all major markets growing strong double-digits. Japan had a strong year growing double-digits for '22 with ongoing momentum from new products, most notably AGENT, DCB, Rez\u016bm, POLARx FIT and WATCHMAN FLX. And on a full-year basis, China grew approximately 20% versus 2022. This consistent growth is fueled by the diverse portfolio, focus on innovation and strong commercial execution. Looking ahead, we expect China to be an accretive mid-teens grower over our '24 to '26 LRP. And to achieve over $1 billion in sales in '24, supported by new product launches, supply chain agility and sustained investments in our talents and capabilities. The team Latin America grew 17% operationally versus both Q4 and full year '22, with seven of eight business units growing double-digits on a full year basis. I'll now provide some additional commentary on our BUs. Urology had an excellent quarter, 10% organic growth versus Q4 '22, and on a full year basis grew 11% organically. Full year growth was led by our Stone Management and Prosthetic Urology globally. And in 2023, we re-launched our direct-to-patient campaign driving therapy awareness for erectile dysfunction and supporting double-digit growth within our Prosthetic Urology franchise. We're excited about the opportunities ahead in Urology, including our recently announced agreement to acquire Axonics, a medical technology company that offers innovative devices, treat urinary and bowel dysfunction. We look forward to bringing these complementary portfolios together and expanding access to differentiated technologies for physicians and patients. Endoscopy sales were also excellent in the quarter, growing 12% operationally and 11% organically versus fourth quarter of '22, on a full year basis, growing 12% operationally and 11% organically. Within the quarter, strong results were led by AXIOS and single-use scopes, both growing double-digits. On a full year basis, all regions grew double-digits, supported by the broad and deep portfolio, new product innovation and focus on commercial excellence. Neuromodulation sales grew 7% operationally and 3% organically versus fourth quarter '22, on a full-year basis, 7% operationally and 5% organically versus '22. Our Brain franchise grew double-digits both in the quarter and on a full-year basis, driven by the Vercise Genus portfolio and our innovative Image Guided Programming, which is designed to improve the precision and efficiency of the deep brain stimulation procedure. In the fourth quarter, on an organic basis, our Pain franchise was flat year-over-year, which was in line with our expectations. We expect our performance to improve in 2024 with the recent launch of our US WaveWriter Alpha DPN indication and the strong and real-world data on FAST recently presented at NANS. Furthermore, with the completion of our Relievant Medsystems acquisition in the fourth quarter, we're excited about our ability to offer an expanded Pain portfolio that supports a comprehensive treatment algorithm now included a novel Intracept system for the treatment of chronic low back pain. Peripheral Interventions sales were excellent, also growing 12% operationally and 10% organically versus Q4, on a full-year basis, growing 13% operationally and 11% organically versus '22. Arterial growth was led by the performance of our Drug-Eluting portfolio both in Q4 and on a full year. This market remains underpenetrated with more than half the procedure is still being used with bare-metal devices, underscoring the importance of our ongoing commitment to innovation and clinical evidence. In Venous, Q4 and full year growth was led by Varithena, our market-leading varicose vein technology. Additionally, in fourth quarter, EKOS growth was supported by REAL-PE, the largest real-world and near real-time dataset evaluating advanced therapies for pulmonary embolism patients. Our Interventional Oncology franchise performed extremely well in the fourth quarter and in 2023, growing low double-digits with strength across our portfolio of robust embolization technologies and cancer therapies We continue to look to expand our clinical evidence and are pleased to have commenced enrollment in the ROWAN trial, which will assess the safety and efficacy of using TheraSphere in combination with immunotherapy to treat HCC, the most common type of primary liver cancer. Cardiology delivered tremendous quarter -- delivered tremendous fourth quarter and year with both operational and organic sales growing 14% versus fourth quarter and for the full year 2022. Within Cardiology, Interventional Cardiology Therapies sales grew 10% for the full year and -- for the fourth quarter and full year. On a full-year basis, the Coronary Therapies franchise growth was driven by strong performance in our international regions and our Imaging franchise globally. AGENT Drug-Coated Balloon continues to perform very well in Japan. We now expect approval of AGENT in the US in the first half of 2024. AGENT DCB will be the first coronary drug-eluting balloon in the US indicated for in-stent restenosis, providing physicians and their patients a solution for this unmet clinical need. Our Structural Heart Valves franchise grew double-digits in both fourth quarter and in a full year basis, led by the performance of ACURATE Neo2 in Europe. And we now have treated more than 70,000 patients to date with our ACURATE technology globally. As we look ahead, we anticipate approval of ACURATE Prime in Europe in 2025. However, after reviewing a planned interim analysis of the US ACURATE IDE data, we will now wait for the full one-year data from the RCT cohort of 100 patients to determine our regulatory strategy. Therefore, we no longer anticipate the approval of ACURATE Prime in the US in 2024. Additionally in alignment with the FDA, we are suspending enrollment in the Single-arm Continued Access study, while continuing to enroll in the randomized extended durability cohorts. We expect to have more information in the second half of 2024, following the full data review. WATCHMAN sales grew 23% organically versus fourth quarter '22 and 25% on a full year basis. Q4 finished with record sales and strong utilization in all major markets. We have now treated over 400,000 patients globally with the WATCHMAN technology. US Q4 growth of 23% was supported by the breadth of the portfolio and the initial launch of WATCHMAN FLX Pro, which we expect to move into full launch in the first quarter. We continue to expand the breadth of clinical evidence supporting this technology and are pleased with the pace of enrollment within our post-market HEAL-LAA trial, including our newly added cohort, which is studying WATCHMAN FLX Pro, an underrepresented patient population. We also look forward to initiating our Monotherapy trial, SIMPLIFY trial later this year, which will study WATCHMAN FLX Pro with the simplified post-implant drug regimen. Cardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 5% organically versus Q4 '22, and on a full year basis grew 6% organically versus '22. On a full year basis, our Diagnostics franchise grew double-digits outpacing market growth, driven by broad portfolio and ongoing investments in innovation. In Core CRM, in both fourth quarter and on a full year basis, our high-voltage business grew low-single digits and our low-voltage business grew mid-single-digits. 2023 performance was driven by our differentiated high-voltage portfolio and shock polarity options. As we look ahead, we expect our Core CRM growth to be in line with the market performance in '24. Turning to Electrophysiology, sales grew 43%, both operationally and organically versus fourth quarter '22, and on a full year basis grew 37% operationally and 33% organically versus '22. US fourth quarter sales grew 40% organically, driven by our POLARx launch and ongoing momentum with our Access Solutions portfolio. Our international EP growth accelerated in the fourth quarter, growing 46% organically, fueled by improved FARAPULSE console supply. We now treated over 40,000 patients globally with the FARAPULSE technology to-date. And with the news this morning that we received FDA approval for FARAPULSE, we are thrilled to enter the US market immediately. We continue to invest in ClinicalEVIDENCE to study new indications and support access to our FARAPULSE technology. Late last year, we initiated the AVANT GUARD trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the system. It's a first-line treatment for Persistent AF compared to antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Additionally, real-world data was presented at AHA for more than 17,000 patients treated with the FARAPULSE from the MANIFEST-17K registry, which reinforced the real-world safety profile of the FARAPULSE platform with no reports of permanent phrenic nerve palsy or pulmonary vein stenosis or esophageal injury and an overall major adverse rate event rate of less than 1%. We're excited to bring this innovative technology to more markets and expect approval of FARAPULSE in Japan -- China and Japan likely in the second half of this year. In closing, I'm very proud of our global team what we were able to accomplish in '23, resulting in a full year organic sales growth of 12% and adjusted EPS growth of 20%. We're excited about the year ahead and remain focused on our talent, sustaining a culture that's motivated to drive differentiated performance and achieve our long-range plan goals. Those goals, as a reminder, are sales an average of 8% to 10% over the three-year period, while expanding adjusted operating margin by 150 basis points, including double-digit adjusted EPS growth, an improvement of our free cash flow conversion to approximately 70% in 2026. With all of that, I'll pass it over to Dan to provide more details on the financials. Daniel Brennan : Thanks, Mike. Fourth quarter 2023 consolidated revenue of $3,725 million, represents 14.9% reported growth versus fourth quarter of 2022 and includes a 40 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange, in line with our expectations. Excluding this $12 million tailwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 14.5% in the quarter. Sales from closed acquisitions and divestitures contributed 90 basis points resulting in 13.6% organic revenue growth, exceeding our guidance range of 8% to 10%. Q4 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 grew 24% versus 2022, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range of $0.49 to $0.52, primarily driven by our strong sales performance. Full year 2023 consolidated revenue of $14,240 million represents 12.3% reported revenue growth versus full year 2022 and includes an 80 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, again in line with our expectations. Excluding this $104 million headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth for the year was 13.1%. Sales from closed acquisitions and divestitures contributed 80 basis points, resulting in 12.3% organic revenue growth, exceeding our guidance range of approximately 11%. Full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $2.05, grew 20% versus 2022, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $1.99 to $2.02. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 70.4%, resulting in full year 2023 adjusted gross margin of 70.7%, in line with our expectations and representing a 20 basis point improvement versus full year 2022, inclusive of a 220 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. In 2024, we expect a mixed benefit from our new launches with offsetting headwinds from FX and the incremental investment in our manufacturing capacity. And as a result, we anticipate our full year 2024 adjusted gross margin will be at or slightly below our full-year 2023 rate. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.6%, resulting in a full year 2023 adjusted operating margin of 26.3%, improving 70 basis points versus 2022. We expect to expand adjusted operating margin in 2024 by another 30 basis points to 50 basis points, balancing progress towards our long-range plan goal of 150 basis points over the three years, 2024 to 2026, with flexibility for critical investments to support key launches. On a GAAP basis, the fourth quarter operating margin was 15.7%, resulting in a full year reported operating margin of 16.5%. Moving to below the line, fourth quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $79 million, resulting in full year adjusted interest and other expenses of $331 million in line with our expectations. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 10% and 11.2% for the full year 2023, including favorable discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Our operational tax rate was 14.6% for the fourth quarter and 13.9% for the full year, again in line with expectations. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1,477 million shares in Q4 and 1,464 million shares for full year 2023. Free cash flow for the quarter was $718 million with $984 million of operating activities, less $267 million of net capital expenditures. Excluding special items, adjusted free cash flow was $913 million. Full year 2023 cash flow was $1.8 billion and adjusted free cash flow was $2.5 billion, both in line with expectations. For 2024, we expect full year free cash flow to be in excess of $2 billion, which includes approximately $800 million of expected payments related to acquisitions, restructuring, litigation and other special items. As of December 31st, 2023, we had cash on hand, $865 million, and our gross debt leverage was 2.3 times. We expect to fund the Axonics acquisition through a mix of cash on hand and new debt, which will be determined prior to or at the time of close. Our top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A, followed by annual share repurchases to offset dilution from employee stock grants. Our legal reserve was $377 million as of December 31st, a decrease of $30 million versus the prior quarter, $108 million of this reserve is already funded through our qualified settlement funds. Now I'll walk through guidance for the first quarter and the full year 2024. We expect full year 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 8.5% to 9.5% versus 2023. Excluding an approximate 50 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, we expect full year 2024 operational revenue growth to be 9% to 10%, excluding a 100 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full year 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 8% to 9% versus 2023. We expect first quarter 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 7.5% to 9.5% versus first quarter 2023. Excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, we expect first quarter 2024 operational growth to be 8.5% to 10.5%, excluding a 150 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect first quarter 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 7% to 9% versus Q1 2023. We expect our full year 2024 adjusted below the line expenses to be approximately $330 million. Under current legislation, including enacted laws and issued guidance under OECD Pillar Two rules, we forecast a full year 2024 operational tax rate of approximately 14% and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13%. We continue to monitor tax legislation globally, including the currently drafted law to partially repeal US R&D capitalization. If the law were to be passed as currently proposed, we would expect a tailwind of approximately 100 basis points to our operational tax rate in 2024. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.23 to $2.27, representing 9% to 11% growth versus 2023, including an approximate $0.04 headwind from foreign exchange at current rates and existing hedging contracts, which will be recognized ratably through the year. We expect first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.50 to $0.52. For more information, please check our investor relations website for Q4 2023 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q4 and full year results and 2024 guidance. In closing, I'm very proud of our 2023 performance and look forward to executing on our 2024 guidance of 8% to 9% organic revenue growth, 30 basis points to 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth of 9% to 11%. Before I turn it back over to Lauren for the Q&A, I wanted to provide a quick update. A key part of our talent strategy is moving high-potential individuals throughout the company to give them a broad set of experiences. As part of this, effective March 1st, Lauren Tengler will become the Global Controller for our Urology business unit, providing financial leadership to the global business and importantly, playing a key role in the integration of the Axonics business. Lauren previously spent many years within our Urology business, making her uniquely qualified for this opportunity. Following Lauren's transition, Jon Monson, currently our Chief Accounting Officer, will move to our Investor Relations function, leading Ally DeVoe and the rest of the team. I know the investment community will join me in thanking Lauren for her leadership and contributions and in welcoming Jon to the role. With that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A. Lauren Tengler : Thanks so much, Dan. Drew, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. In order for us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Drew, please go ahead. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Robert Marcus : Oh, great. Congrats on a really good quarter and congratulations, Lauren, on the promotion. Wanted to ask on two of the biggest product drivers in 2024, WATCHMAN and FARAPULSE. FARAPULSE got approval today. Wanted to see what's included in guidance for this year and how to think about phasing over the year. How long will it take to get into hospitals and approved on formularies? And then second on WATCHMAN, look, still had a very good quarter and fourth quarter, but growth slowed a little bit. How should we be thinking about the potential for WATCHMAN and 20% plus growth in 2024? Thanks a lot. Michael Mahoney : Sure. Thanks, Robbie, for the comments. I'll start with the WATCHMAN, just an excellent platform with the growth of 23% for the quarter, 25% for the full year. Terrific work. And as you know, that product gets larger and larger for us. I had to cut the script back because the clinical investments we're making with WATCHMAN will go on for a while, and we can touch on those if interested. But as you know, we continue to exceed likely 90% share in the US. We'll be rolling out WATCHMAN Flex Pro, you know, more as a percent of our total mix in the US in the first quarter and throughout the year. So you'll continue to see that, which is a differentiated platform. So with the clinical work that we're doing and the WATCHMAN Flex Pro and the Steerable Sheath likely to be in the market in 2024 as well, we continue to expect to gain share, and we aim to significantly widen the market opportunity through these clinical trials. So full steam ahead with WATCHMAN. On FARAPULSE, maybe the most exciting day I've had in my career at Boston Scientific with this platform that we have, based on the results that we've seen in Europe and the enthusiasm globally for our PFA platform. And to receive approval today was really exciting. We did anticipate a first-quarter approval for FARAPULSE. And as you might expect, we expect the impact of FARAPULSE to be, you know, somewhat in the first quarter and much more significant as the year goes on as we work with contracting with hospitals, getting on contract and getting the capital approved and rolling it out. But we have a lot of experience in doing that through our European success that we've enjoyed. Our team is trained. We have installation team. We continue to invest in it. So we're really excited about aiming to disrupt the EP market with what we think is the premier PFA platform. Robert Marcus : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you and good morning. I don't want to leave FARAPULSE quite yet, and I suspect there'll be a lot of questions on it this call. But if you're looking for China and Japan approval in the second half of '24, could you sort of outline what you think those opportunities maybe? And then can you just give a quick highlight on some of the other sort of higher profile cardiology companies such as POLARx and AGENT? Thank you. Michael Mahoney : Yeah, so Ken can help me out. But obviously China and Japan represent significant opportunities in the EP market. They're the largest markets that we compete in -- in those countries and we currently are under-scaled, particularly in China. In Japan, we built a lot of momentum over the last, call it, 18 months with our POLARx launch. So in Japan, you know, that grew, I don't know, I think over 40%, our EP business. And so we have a more scaled commercial team capabilities in Japan. And the eventual approval in the second half of this year in Japan with FARAPULSE will really be, you know, the next leg of the growth stool in Japan for us. So a lot of confidence there. The market in China may be even bigger. We're a bit more under-scaled in China, so we'll be making a lot of investments there. We have a brand new leader. We're excited about in China to run our EP business under June Chang. So we'll be making additional commercial investments, clinical investments, and hope to have approval in the second half of the year in China. So those will be nice growth drivers for us in '24, more significant in 2025. And AGENT, Ken, do you want to comment a bit more on FARAPULSE? Dr. Stein? Kenneth Stein : I mean, I love to comment on FARAPULSE. Again it is a very exciting day. Joanne, in terms of the questions specifically about Japan and China, right. I think we got to realize I mean, AFib is a global disease. I hate to use the word pandemic, but it is pandemic. Now and we're really pleased about the strength of the clinical trial data that we have as well as the commercial experience in Europe with, as Mike said, you know, greater than 40,000 patients already treated to-date. And it's that strength of the clinical data, right, that led us to the really, I think, rapid approval that we got from the FDA, and that has led us to update our anticipated approval times both in Japan and China. Again, I think having said that, you know, we look to those approvals in the second half. So I don't think we're going to expect to really see too much material out of that until we get into 2025. But they are both large and important markets and large and important patient populations that are currently really very much underserved in terms of access to Ablation technology. Joanne Wuensch : AGENT. Michael Mahoney : Thanks, Joanne Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on a strong finish here and the approval of FARAPULSE in the US. On FARAPULSE, can you talk about the manufacturing capacity for the catheter and console upon launch? And expectations for the EP business this year? You know you grew 43% in Q4'23. Any reason why growth would be lower in '24? And I have to ask you to please clarify your comments around ACURATE Neo2. It sounds like something happened with Prime, which is the larger size. What are the implications for the other sizes of Neo2 in Europe and the US? Thank you. Michael Mahoney : Thanks, Larry. Starting with FARAPULSE, really very proud of the global supply chain team and what they've done over the past 18 months in the FARAPULSE Group that we originally acquired a while ago. But they've done a tremendous job in building capabilities to supply this for the US launch and to expand in Europe, and eventually Asia, as we just highlighted. So we are now significantly improved our catheter and console supply. We opened numerous centers in Europe in the fourth quarter and we're ready to go. So we, at this point, don't anticipate supply being an issue to continue to support Europe or to facilitate the US launch, given the capabilities and investments that we've made in approvals to manufacture in multiple locations. So great work by the supply chain team. And we're ready to launch this in the US. On ACURATE Neo2, as I mentioned in the earnings script, maybe just two overall points. We continue to do very well with ACURATE Neo2 in Europe, implanting, I think, the number 70,000, and continuing to grow faster than the market in Europe. And we are on track for what we have is called Prime in Europe in 2025. So that continues to move forward as planned. With respect to the trial, as I mentioned in the script, based on the interim analysis, we now need to wait for the full one year follow up of the 1,500 patients. And as a result of that, we don't -- we will not be receiving approval for ACURATE Neo2 in 2024. And we will wait until likely near the end of 2024 for the full readout of the ACURATE IDE study to determine our path forward. Larry Biegelsen : Thank you, and congrats, Lauren. Lauren Tengler : Thanks, Larry. Operator : The next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a really strong finish here. Maybe just one on the guidance here perhaps for Dan. Dan, the 8% to 9%, it looks like FARAPULSE, the prior guided, I'd assume, a back half launch. It's coming in a little bit ahead. Can you just, you know, walk us through the 8% to 9%. Is that right that FARAPULSE, perhaps, assumptions have changed? Any impact from VBP or base impact that we should be aware of? And what is -- what are you assuming for pricing in fiscal '24? Thank you. Daniel Brennan : Sure. So the VBP assumptions are the same as they've always been, really no change there. As you saw, in December, when we issued the press release on AVANT GUARD, we moved up the timing of expected FARAPULSE launch to Q1. So we've been anticipating Q1 launch. And that 8% to 9% full year and the 7% to 9% for the first quarter in terms of revenue growth contemplated a Q1 approval of FARAPULSE, as Mike said, you know, there's probably some contribution in Q1, but more of that contribution comes in Q2 to Q4. So the 8% to 9% has that contemplated in the overall guide. And then pricing, so I would say on pricing is, we were basically flat in 2023 and the goal is to be flat again in 2024. So likely no impact would be the goal in 2024 versus 2023. Vijay Kumar : Fantastic. Sorry, on days, Dan? Any days impact here? Daniel Brennan : No, all the days -- there's a lot of, obviously, a lot of noise in days around the world through the year. It's all contemplated in the guidance. All in the 8% to 8% for the full year. Vijay Kumar : Fantastic. Thank you guys. Michael Mahoney : Sure, Vijay. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Please go ahead. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just a follow-up question on ACURATE Neo2, Mike, if I could. So appreciate the comments that you did provide. Just curious, I mean, obviously, you're giving pretty strong guidance here for 2024. I mean, is the right read here that regardless of what happens with ACURATE Neo2 and timing there, you're sticking to your long-term sales growth guidance that you provided back in September. And sort of how do we think about this as a long-term growth contributor now, given this little wrinkle here? And Lauren, we will miss you very much. Thanks so much. Michael Mahoney : Lauren is not leaving the company. She will be around. She'll be around. We're still going to see her. Danielle Antalffy : But we won't get to see her, so. Michael Mahoney : Okay, well. Danielle Antalffy : I'll work my way in. Michael Mahoney : We'll work our way in, right, once in a while. So we're excited for John to come in and Lauren to move out. No, excited for Lauren to go to Urology. Yes. So to answer your question, we are fully committed to the 8% to 10% organic growth CAGR over the '24 to '26 period that we provided in Investor Day. Absolutely no change in that outlook. And pleased with the '23 performance, as you know, where we grew 12%. So absolutely no change to those financial goals. You know, ACURATE continues to do well in Europe. It's a product that's used every day by many European physicians and we're excited about getting the larger size approved there. We are disappointed that we didn't get ACURATE over the goal line for approval in 2024. So at this point, we need to wait until the full data sets been followed up for a year and read out likely before the end of this year in 2024. And we'll take it from there in terms of the US launch. But we are disappointed we're not going to launch that really very end of this year and into next, but absolutely no change to our financial guidance that we gave at Investor Day. Danielle Antalffy : Okay. Great. And also welcome, Jon. Sorry, I didn't mean to leave you out. Thanks so much guys. Jon Monson : Thanks, Danielle. Operator : The next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Travis Steed : Hey, thanks for taking the question. Maybe one more follow-up on TAVR. Can you just remind us what the interim look was? Was that just like a six-month look at the data? Now you need to wait for one-year data for the line to separate. And curious if you think what you saw in the interim look. Are you still pretty confident that at one year? We could have a US TAVR launch? Or does this put the whole US TAVR launch at risk? Michael Mahoney : Janar, Are you able to hear us okay? Janarthanan Sathananthan : Yes, I can hear you loud and clear. Michael Mahoney : Great. Dr. Sathananthan is our Chief Medical Officer, as you know, for ICT and Structural Heart. Maybe he could comment a bit. Janarthanan Sathananthan : Yeah. I'll take the comment just about the data. So essentially what happened in the trial was that as part of a planned interim analysis, we made the decision to await the full one-year data. It is important just to note that the accurate IDE study is still an active clinical study with active clinical follow-up. And so as a result, we cannot disclose any data related to the trial at this time. We will expect, as Mike said, a readout of the study in the second half of 2024, following a full data review. Travis Steed : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Josh Jennings : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations for a strong end of the year. Wanted to ask about the international cardiac ablation market. Boston, incredible fourth quarter, 40% plus growth. Some of your competitors delivered really strong international growth in their electrophysiology businesses as well. What's going on in the international market? I mean, are we seeing the promise of PFA driving market expansion this early? Or is there any pricing dynamics going on? But I think it's 20% almost market growth in internationally for cardiac ablation this year. Just wanted to get some details there and whether that could translate to PFA launches in the United States, driving market expansion, which I think you guys detailed in your Investor Day. Thanks for taking the question. Michael Mahoney : Dr. Stein, do you want to take a shot on it? Kenneth Stein : Yes, Josh, and thanks, Mike. I think it's a couple of factors here, and I don't know that I can parse out for you, you know, how much is getting contributed from each. But again, I think we just begin with the fact, right, that atrial fibrillation is an incredibly common arrhythmia. Again, as I said earlier, it is literally pandemic worldwide. I know, for instance, in the US, right, a quarter of adults over the age of 40 will experience Afib at some point in our lives. And ablation, even with legacy thermal technologies, things for us, like stable point or POLARx is incredibly effective. It's more effective than drugs. But on a global scale, it is still really incredibly underpenetrated as a market. And much of the growth that you see, really just reflects, I think, you know, increasing realization in the cardiology community, the referring physician community, about the relative efficacy and safety of all ablation technologies. And then you layer on top of that the promise and the data of FARAPULSE, right? And FARAPULSE, again, it takes a procedure that's already effective. It is at least as effective. It is clearly safer. And it's also much more efficient than thermal ablation. And so that, right, enables docs and medical centers to scale this out much better, right, and start to get into this underpenetratrated population. So maybe a long-winded answer, but the short answer is, right, it's both a dramatically underpenetrated population to begin with, and then on top of that, you have the accelerated impact of FARAPULSE. Josh Jennings : Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Richard Newitter with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Richard Newitter : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a really strong finish to the year. Michael Mahoney : Thanks. Richard Newitter : My first question is just going back to TAVR. You know, at your Analyst Day, you had talked to, you know, an expectation and a level of confidence that you could disrupt that market in the US relatively quickly out of the gate. I'm just curious with, you know, and get something approaching 20% share of the market over time, which is what you've done, you know, in other markets with your disruption capabilities. I'm just curious, does anything change there with the indeterminate kind of view of what the next steps are for the US? I'm just trying to focus on that commentary a bit. You know, does your outlook for the franchise in the US change in TAVR? And then I have a follow-up. Kenneth Stein : Yeah. Just a few clarifying points. Again, in Europe, where we set 70,000 valves and physicians use it routinely on an everyday basis. We continue to grow faster than the market there and have continued to done that for, I don't know, 10 quarters in a row. So we make nice progress. And we're excited about getting the large valve size approved in Europe. I believe in 2025 is the time period. In the US, you know, honestly, first of all, I would state that we've never quoted a market share goal for TAVR in the US. So we never said 20. I'm not sure if that was what you put in your models or not. But based on the results that we've seen in Europe, we've always been confident in our ability to have ACURATE be a meaningful growth driver in the US, as we stated in Investor Day. You know, as a result of this, we are disappointed that, you know, we're not going to have this launched in 2024. As we talked about, based on the data that we just highlighted in the script, and as Janar mentioned, we now need to wait for the full year data, the full one-year follow-up on the 1,500 patients, and then working with the FDA and submitting that and having a data readout by year-end 2024. And we'll take it from there. So we -- as Janar said, the trial is still active. So we do not expect any of this news to alter our 8% to 10% organic growth over the three-year period. We're coming off of 12%. We continue to grow faster than most all of our peers and drop EPS faster than our peer group. And we're still very committed to those financial targets. And we're hopeful that ACURATE will continue to be a big growth driver for us. But a lot of it depends on that data readout in fourth quarter '24. Richard Newitter : Okay. Thanks for that. And then maybe just on M&A, you know, you've been active in 2023 and congrats on Relievant and more recently Axonics early this year. I'm just curious on kind of how we should think about, you know, how aggressive and opportunistic you'll be over the next twelve months. You mentioned, obviously your first priority remains deploying capital for tuck-ins. You know, but do we kind of think of you guys in a little bit of a digestion period or kind of steady she goes just as aggressive and opportunistic as you have been in the past? Daniel Brennan : Sure, I can take that one. So as you mentioned, Axonics, the most recent deal we did. Super pleased with that. I think that is a classic tuck-in for Boston Scientific. It's one, I think, we -- as you look back, these types of deals, we really do well with and we're super excited to have that close and welcome the Axonics team into the BSE family. As you said, we've been remarkably consistent over a long period of time. Tuck-in M&A is still the number one capital allocation priority for us and will continue to be active. In terms of how active over the near-to medium-term. This is not a major event like a major delevering event that we need to do. This is -- take on a little bit of additional debt over a period of time. And then over a very reasonable period of time, we'll be right back to where we are today relative to our leverage goal. So I look us -- I look for us to continue to be active in the tuck-in M&A space in '24 and beyond. Richard Newitter : Okay. Again, congrats on an outstanding 4Q. Michael Mahoney : Thank you. Daniel Brennan : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Patrick Wood : Amazing. Thank you for taking the question and congrats, Lauren. I'd like to stick with Axonics, if that's all right. I appreciate it hasn't closed yet. But I'm just kind of curious, you know, Urology in Boston has a very sizable distribution network across, I guess, primarily Stone Management, but a whole bunch of different areas. How are you thinking about, you know, the ability to drive adoption in OAB faster and like really push that asset? I'm guessing, you know, having just played with the numbers, and correct me if I'm wrong, but there's some assumption of slightly faster growth once you've acquired Axonics and the Street previously had in there. At least that's where I end up with the numbers. Feel free to correct me. But how are you thinking about the commercialization really pushing that through the distribution network? Thanks. Michael Mahoney : Sure. Well, we haven't closed it yet. We hope to first half this year. You know, the team at Axonics done an amazing job with this platform since starting the company years ago and taking significant share and what is a strong double-digit growth market. The team at Axonics, you know, can't speak too much for them. It hasn't closed yet, has also done a remarkable job in a few areas. One at just the core technology where they gain -- leveraged that to gain share, the clinical data that they have, the commercial excellence that they possess, and also expanding the market through their direct-to-patient marketing and awareness. So this is a significant global opportunity. And the patient awareness of this treatment is still early days. And so that's one reason why we acquired the company was the momentum they have the technology and the long-term market cater that we see based on the global opportunity. The market today is reasonable nearly all US. That's something we'll evaluate more in the future here as to would it make sense for us to bring this to select markets outside the US, given the data that we have? As you mentioned, we have a significant commercial channel in our Urology business through all of our different business units within Urology. So this is an ideal fit. It is an adjacency for us. We don't have any competitive product in this area. So it's a nice adjacency for us that will allow us to compete more comprehensively with Urology customers. But we aim to, you know, take Axonics to the next level, but that team has done a terrific job to date. Patrick Wood : Amazing. Thanks for taking the question. Michael Mahoney : Sure. Operator : And just to verify, do we have time for one more question? Lauren Tengler : Yes. One last question, please. Operator : Okay. That question will come from Michael Polark with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Michael Polark : Good morning. Thanks for sneaking me in. I'll ask a gross margin question. Dan, I heard in the script for '24 flat to maybe slightly down year-on-year in the guide. The world seems to be calmer on price cost, but as we all know, the Middle East is flaring. And so, I'm curious, one, have you built in any cushion for kind of cost-push from those events? And two, in real-time, are you seeing any impact in the field? And if so, what does that look like? Daniel Brennan : Yeah, I can give you the short answer and a little bit longer answer. So the short one is that we've contemplated all that. Our team is super close to everything relative to our global supply chain network. And so there -- everything that we have in the guidance that we gave contemplates what we know today and what -- and the guidance that they're giving us on that, which -- the impact is minimal. Overall on gross margin, the little bit longer answer. You know, if you look at '23, we came in pretty much right where we expected at that 70.7%. And then, as we said at the Investor Day in September, we said it would be a challenge to contribute to our margin expansion goals in '24, right, which that's probably going to prove out to be true because we're saying we'll be either at or slightly below. But that's okay, as there are many other areas of the P&L, and as you know, we have a pretty solid track record over time of managing all those lines of the P&L to drive margin expansion, most recently that 70 basis points last year. So for '24, I'd kind of point to two headwinds and two tailwinds that will play out, and, again, have us at that kind of at or slightly below the 70.7% we put up last year. And one is inflation. And that's probably a little bit of a tailwind, right? So the macro factors are improving, in general, relative to inflation and other things. But as a reminder, we entered into, you know, contracts for many elements of materials for 2024 already last year. So we don't see that full benefit. But in '25 and '26, I'd like to believe there's even more benefit there, not only from the macro side of inflation, but also for gross margin in total. And then our mix, so you know, getting the FARAPULSE approval today, that's exciting because that's a great mix thing for the company, and many of our other launches are as well. And then on the headwind side, foreign exchange was a headwind in '23, that continue in '24. And as I said, at Investor Day, good problem to have, but we also need to make investments in manufacturing capacity to support the sales growth, you know, growing 12% last year and then 8% to 9% this year. But we're absolutely committed to the 150 basis points over three years. Gross margin probably won't pay a lot of bills for us in '24, but I think it certainly will in '25 and '26. Recall, we used to be north of 72% back in 2019. And we are maniacally focused to get there and then to get the overall operating margin kind of, you know, on the doorstep of 28 when we get to 2026. And that puts that 30% long-term goal that we've had kind of right in our line of sight as we're in 2026. Michael Polark : Thank you. Michael Mahoney : Thank you.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Jon Monson, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jonathan Monson : Thank you, Drew, and welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q1 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a link to that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials & Filings. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately 1 hour. Mike and Dan will provide comments on Q1 performance as well as the outlook for our business, including Q2 and full year 2024 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. And organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures, for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales. Relevant acquisitions and divestitures excluded for organic growth are the majority stake investment in Acotec Scientific Holdings Limited and the acquisitions of Apollo Endosurgery and Relievant Medsystems, which closed in February, April and November 2023, respectively, as well as our acquisition of the endoluminal vacuum therapy portfolio from B. Braun, which closed in March 2024. Divestitures include the endoscopy pathology business, which closed in April 2023. Guidance excludes the previously announced agreement to acquire Axonics, Inc., which is expected to close in the second half of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. For more information, please refer to our Q1 Financial and Operational Highlights deck, which may be found on our Investor Relations website. On this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified, are organic. This call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities law, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, may, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share; new and anticipated product approvals and launches; acquisitions, clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected use of cash; our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings; as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. If our underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect or certain risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them, except as required by law. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike. Mike? Michael Mahoney : Thanks, Jon. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. Our first quarter results surpassed our expectations, fueled by our innovative portfolio, including the nearly 90 new products we launched globally in 2023, the execution of our category leadership strategy and the winning spirit of our global team. In the first quarter '24, total company operational sales grew 15% and organic sales grew 13% versus first quarter '23, which exceeds the high end of our guidance range of 7% to 9%. Our strong growth continues to be diversified across businesses and regions. In the quarter, 6 of our 8 business units in all of our regions grew double digits. We believe that most business units grew faster than their respective markets with differentiated portfolios and strong commercial execution, supported by healthy procedural demand. First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.56, which grew 21% versus 2023, which exceeds the high end of our guidance range of $0.50 to $0.52. First quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.2%. Turning to our second quarter and full year '24 outlook. We are guiding to organic growth of 10% to 12% for second quarter '24 and raising our full year guidance from 8% to 9% to 10% to 12%, reflecting momentum from our innovative portfolio, healthy procedural volumes and continued execution by our global team. Our second quarter '24 adjusted EPS guidance is $0.57 to $0.59 and we expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $2.29 to $2.34, representing growth of 12% to 14%. Dan will provide more details on our financials and I'll provide additional highlights on our first quarter, along with comments on our '24 outlook. Regionally, on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 13% versus first quarter with particular strength in EP, fueled by the launch of FARAPULSE midway through the quarter, as well as on our WATCHMAN ICTx Urology and Endoscopy business units. Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 13% on an operational basis versus first quarter '23. This above-market growth was led by exceptional performance in EP as well as double-digit growth in our Endoscopy, Urology and PI businesses. We expect to continue to outpace the market, driven by continued broad-based momentum across our business and investment in emerging markets. Asia Pac grew 26% operationally versus first quarter '23, led by strong double-digit performance in all of our Cardiovascular business units. Japan grew double digits driven by AGENT DCB, Rezum and our Access Solutions products. China delivered excellent results, growing strong double digits with 7 of our 8 business units growing double digits. I'll now provide some additional commentary on our business units.  In Urology, sales grew 10%, both operationally and organically versus first quarter '23, with double-digit growth in stone management as well as prosthetic urology. Rezum performed well in the quarter, both in the U.S. and internationally, and secured reimbursement status in France. We look forward to closing the previously announced acquisition of Axonics now expected in the second half of 2024. Endoscopy sales grew 12% operationally and 10% organically versus first quarter '23. Strong first quarter results were driven by the breadth of our portfolio, underpinned by differentiated anchor products such as AXIOS and our single-use imaging products. Within the quarter, we also received CE Mark for our MANTIS Clip and NICE in the U.K. issued positive guidance for the ESG endoscopic bariatric surgery procedure, both expected to further momentum in our growing endoluminal surgery franchise. Neuromodulation sales grew 10% operationally and declined 1% organically versus first quarter '23. Our brain franchise grew high single digits in the quarter with low double-digit U.S. growth driven by our comprehensive directional stimulation offering enabled by image-guided programming. In the first quarter, our pain franchise grew low double digits operationally, but declined mid-single digits on an organic basis, with continued pressure in our U.S. SCS business. In the U.S., during the first quarter, we did receive FDA approval and recently launched the WaveWriter symptom (sic) [ system ] nonsurgical back pain indication and our next-generation FAST AutoDose. Importantly, the Relievant business continues to perform very well with steady expansion of payer coverage, and we expect sales from the novel Intracept procedure to grow about 50% in 2024. Peripheral Intervention sales grew 16% operationally and 11% organically versus first quarter '23. Double-digit growth in arterial was bolstered by our drug-eluting portfolio supported by the strength of clinical evidence and global commercial execution. In venous, we saw continued above-market growth from Varithena and clot management continued to perform well, in line with expectations. Our interventional oncology franchise grew strong double digits in the first quarter, driven by our broad offering of embolization devices, including the Embold coil family in cancer therapies. In the quarter, TheraSphere also grew double digits and data from the real-world study, PROACTIF, was presented, demonstrating positive outcomes in patients with intermediate and advanced HCC who were treated with TheraSphere. Cardiology sales delivered another excellent quarter with both operational and organic sales growing 18% versus first quarter 2023. Within Cardiology, Interventional Cardiology Therapy sales grew an impressive 13% organically versus first quarter '23. Growth in Coronary Therapies was driven by continued strength in our international regions, led by our imaging portfolio and AGENT DCB in Japan. In the U.S., we're also pleased with the ongoing launch of AVVIGO+, which is our AI-guided imaging platform. We also received FDA approval of our AGENT DCB in first quarter, and we expect to initiate a limited launch in the second quarter as we ramp supply following the earlier-than-anticipated regulatory approval. Our Structural Heart Valves franchise once again grew mid-teens in first quarter, led by ACURATE neo2, which continues to see growth from both new and existing accounts. We have now submitted for CE Mark for our next-generation ACURATE Prime valve, which we continue to expect to launch in Europe in 2025. WATCHMAN had another strong quarter, growing 19% organically and maintaining our market-leading share position. In the U.S., WATCHMAN FLX Pro moved into full launch and we received FDA clearance for the TruSteer steerable sheath, allowing physicians to achieve more optimal device positioning in the widest range of LAA anatomies. International growth was driven by ongoing momentum in -- ongoing momentum within the quarter, and we received approval and launched WATCHMAN FLX Pro in Japan and Canada, which will support continued growth in these markets. Cardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 5% organically in the first quarter '23. In the first quarter, our Diagnostics franchise also grew double digits, led by strong market adoption of our second-generation LUX-Dx ICM device. In core CRM, our low-voltage business grew mid-single digits and our high-voltage business grew low single digits. Our Emblem S-ICD continues to maintain its strong share position and we've seen very limited impact in Europe or the U.S. from a recent competitor's launch. We expect to remain the clear market leader in this space and look forward to the upcoming data presentation at HRS of MODULAR ATP, which is a pivotal trial studying the use of the Emblem S-ICD in conjunction with our EMPOWER leadless pacemaker to function as a single-chamber pacemaker, as well as to provide anti-tachycardia pacing when needed. We anticipate FDA approval of the modular CRM system and stand-alone EMPOWER leadless pacemaker in '25. Electrophysiology sales grew 72% both operationally and organically versus first quarter '23 driven by the adoption of the transformative FARAPULSE platform. International first quarter sales grew 59%, with continued FARAPULSE account openings and robust utilization in Europe. U.S. first quarter sales grew 85% organically, propelled by the mid-first quarter launch of FARAPULSE. We have already made good progress entering to high-volume accounts, supported by compelling clinical evidence, commercial execution and investment in our supply chain. Early feedback on FARAPULSE has been extremely positive with rapid adoption from both RF and cryo users. Electrophysiologists appreciate FARAPULSE's unique safety profile, ease of use, effectiveness and efficiency of the procedure. We expect our broad EP portfolio, coupled with our other AF solutions, to drive significant global growth in '24 and beyond. We also intend to extend our leadership in PFA by investing in innovation, clinical evidence and global capabilities. Within the quarter, we commenced enrollment of the NAVIGATE-PF clinical trial, studying integrated cardiac mapping with a FARAVIEW software and FARAWAVE non-enabled catheter, both of which are expected to launch in the U.S. during the second half of the year. We also completed enrollment of Phase II in the ADVANTAGE AF clinical trial, studying our FARAPOINT device for CTI ablations, which is expected to launch in the U.S. in 2025. And we also anticipate data from Phase I of the ADVANTAGE trial for persistent AF to be presented in fourth quarter 2024. We also look forward to our clinical late-breakers at the upcoming HRS meeting in May, which aims to highlight the unique capabilities of FARAPULSE. Also of note, this week, we released our 2023 Performance Report, highlighting the company's actions to improve patient outcomes while prioritizing our environmental, social and governance goals. We continue to make progress in all 3 key areas : innovating care to meet patient needs, empowering people and shaping a healthier planet while performing with integrity. While we always have more to do, I know that our values-driven culture and the commitment of our global teams to challenge -- to this challenge of what's possible will continue to raise the bar. In closing, I'm very grateful to our global employees who work every day to advance science for life. We remain committed to investing for the long term while delivering top-tier financial performance in 2024 and beyond. And with that, I'll hand over to Dan to provide more details on the financials. Daniel Brennan : Thanks, Mike. First quarter 2024 consolidated revenue of $3.856 billion represents 13.8% reported growth versus first quarter 2023 and includes a 120 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, in line with our expectations. Excluding this $40 million headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 15% in the quarter. Sales from the closed acquisitions and divestitures contributed 190 basis points, resulting in 13.1% organic revenue growth, exceeding our first quarter guidance range of 7% to 9%. Q1 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $0.56 grew 20.6% versus 2023 exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.50 to $0.52, primarily driven by our strong sales performance. Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 69.8%, which includes an approximate 30 basis point year-over-year headwind from foreign exchange. Adjusted gross margin was slightly lower than anticipated, primarily driven by inventory charges and less favorable product mix due to increased levels of capital placements in the quarter. Despite a lower Q1, we continue to expect full year adjusted gross margin to be at or slightly below our 2023 full year rate, driven by increasing mix benefit from our new launches, lower inventory charges and the full recognition of our annual standard manufacturing cost improvements in the second half of the year. First quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.2%. We remain committed to expanding adjusted operating margin by 30 to 50 basis points in 2024 as we balance progress towards our long-range plan goal of 150 basis points of improvement from 2024 to 2026 with the flexibility to make critical investments to support key launches. On a GAAP basis, first quarter operating margin was 17.5%. Moving to below the line. First quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $80 million. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the first quarter was 10.7%, which includes favorable discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Our operational tax rate was 13.7% for the quarter. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1.482 billion shares in the first quarter. Free cash flow for the first quarter was a negative $15 million with $164 million from operating activities less $179 million in net capital expenditures, which includes payments of $251 million related to acquisitions, restructuring, litigation and other special items. In 2024, we continue to expect full year free cash flow to exceed $2 billion, which includes approximately $800 million of expected payments related to special items. As of March 31, 2024, we had cash on hand of $2.3 billion, inclusive of the $2 billion -- 2 billion euro-denominated senior note offering completed on February 27, which we intend to use to partially fund the Axonics acquisition. During the first quarter, we repaid approximately $500 million of senior notes upon maturity, and our gross debt leverage was 2.5x as of March 31. Our top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A, followed by annual share repurchases to offset dilution from employee stock grants. In alignment with our acquisition strategy, we recently closed the acquisition of the endoluminal vacuum therapy portfolio from B. Braun, which complements our existing endoscopy portfolio and is expected to be immaterial to earnings per share in 2024. Our legal reserve was $283 million as of March 31, a decrease of $94 million versus Q4 2023. And $71 million of this reserve is already funded through our qualified settlement funds. I'll now walk through guidance for Q2 and the full year 2024. We expect full year 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 11% to 13% versus 2023. Excluding an approximate 50 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, we expect full year 2024 operational revenue growth to be 11.5% to 13.5%. Excluding a 150 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full year 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 10% to 12% versus 2023. We expect second quarter 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 10.5% to 12.5% versus second quarter 2023. Excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, we expect second quarter 2024 operational revenue growth to be 11.5% to 13.5%. And excluding a 150 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect second quarter 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 10% to 12% versus 2023. We now expect full year 2024 adjusted below-the-line expense to be approximately $315 million. Under current legislation, including enacted laws and issued guidance under OECD Pillar 2 rules, we continue to forecast a full year 2024 operational tax rate of approximately 14% and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13%. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.29 and to $2.34, representing 12% to 14% growth versus 2023, including an approximate $0.04 headwind from foreign exchange, which is unchanged from our previous expectations. We expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.57 to $0.59. For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q1 2024 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q1 results and our 2024 guidance. And with that, I'll turn it back to Jon, who will moderate the Q&A. Jonathan Monson : Thanks, Dan. Drew, let's open it up for questions for the next 40 minutes or so [Operator Instructions] Drew, please go ahead. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : Great. Congrats on a fantastic quarter. I guess with my one question, it has to be on FARAPULSE and EP in general. The beat was substantial, both U.S. and OUS. The doc feedback we hear is phenomenal on FARAPULSE PFA in general. So I'd just love to get your view on what you're seeing in the field, the willingness to adopt the new technology, how fast it could go and how much of the guidance raise is just from FARAPULSE here and the opportunity. Michael Mahoney : Yes. First, I want to shout out to early pioneering work by Chris O'Hara, the amazing work by the FARAPULSE team and really the work our team has done over multiple years. This is the most transformational product that I've seen in my career with the company. And Dr. Stein can comment on clinically, but we continue to invest significantly in the current platform and in future products and a significant amount of clinical science to really widen the gap in PFA with our FARAPULSE system. And as I mentioned in the script, we're seeing very rapid adoption from both RF and cryo users. We continue to invest in our commercial footprint in the U.S. And we're able to meet the demand thus far with our talented supply chain teams. But we're also excited about the ongoing momentum in Europe, where we've been live for a number of years. But we continue to increase utilization in Europe and open new centers now that they have a bit more supply than they did in 2023. And we're also working diligently with our teams in Asia, in Japan and China, to train them up so they can also take advantage of FARAPULSE really kind of more of a fourth quarter 2025 story in Asia. So it really -- it's a remarkable platform and we're seeing excellent safety results, ease of use, rapid adoption and excellent effectiveness. Dr. Stein, if you want to comment? Ken Stein : Yes. Thanks. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Robbie. Maybe the one thing I'd add, I'd just -- the caution here is against thinking of PFA in general, that every PFA system is very different and I think everyone really needs to be evaluated on its own. So the results you get with PFA are just completely dependent on catheter design, on waveform and on dosing strategy. And as Mike said, what people see when they use FARAPULSE clinically, when people see the data and we've now got published data including randomized clinical trial data, registry data, total data at well over 18,000 patients have reported at this point, and as Mike said, it just has compelling advantages in terms of safety, in terms of efficacy, in terms of ease of use and in terms of efficiency. And that's what you see driving the rapid uptake, both in the U.S. and globally. Operator : The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : I echo Robbie's congratulations on a really strong quarter here. Just with my one question, I feel compelled to ask a big-picture question here. You updated your LRP in September of last year to 8% to 10% organic growth for 2024 to 2026. The assumption at the time was that growth in '25 would accelerate over 2024. You're guiding today to 10% to 12% organic growth. So the question is, do you still expect growth to accelerate in 2025? And how should we think about the 8% to 10% CAGR in the context of this strong 2024 guidance? Michael Mahoney : Yes. So we outlined at Investor Day the 8% to 10% and our goal to be a very high-performing med tech company. And so we're super pleased with the first quarter results that also led to -- and the business momentum led to the guidance you referred to at 10% to $12. So we're pleased with taking our full year guidance up. We did also receive FARAPULSE earlier than we expected. So at this point, we'll hold off and look at our 2025 guidance later in the year. But we're super pleased with the momentum that we have across all regions and all business units. But at this point, we're not going to commit to accelerating growth in 2025. Certainly, our aim would be to do that, but it would be premature to confirm that at this point. Operator : The next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Frederick Wise : I guess I'd focus on perhaps ACURATE neo. It sounds like it's performing well internationally. But can you maybe expand on where you are both internationally, the new product you spoke about and you're feeling about next steps in the United States? Are you feeling more optimistic, more cautious about timing? And just any incremental color would be just great. Michael Mahoney : Sure. Thanks, Rick. We're very pleased with the results in Europe. We continue to grow above market in Europe and have excellent adoption across most major countries in Europe. And importantly, as you said, we've invested quite a bit in this portfolio and we're excited about the Prime submission that we just recently did in Europe, which will enhance the valve further and provide additional valve sizes as well. So we expect that to go well in Europe. In the U.S., there's really not going to be any new commentary that we haven't stated publicly. We are waiting for the full year follow-up. We also will be working with the regulators, and we'll communicate in the future date the timing of the release of that clinical data and our next steps in the U.S. Operator : The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : Another nice quarter. A question on operating margins. I think your LRP was 450 basis points over -- was it over the 2-year period, I would assume? But anyway... Daniel Brennan : No, it was over -- it was -- not to interrupt you, Joanne. It was just over the 3-year period. 2024 to 2026 was 150 basis points. Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : Excellent. Thank you for that clarification. But as I'm looking at the quarter delivery, it looks like some of the leverage came from R&D, some of it came from SG&A. I'm just curious how you're thinking about providing that leverage over the 3-year period. Daniel Brennan : Yes. I think over the 3-year period, all lines will contribute. And I think it's really a great part of the history of the company and the kind of the DNA of the margin expansion story is that at any given point in time, all lines can contribute. So gross margin at that 69.8%, I didn't love that this quarter, but I'm optimistic that, that improves through the year. But we said at Investor Day and we reiterated it on our January call, that gross margin probably is not going to contribute this year to the 30 to 50 points. So this year, it's more of an OpEx leverage story. But absolutely, in '25 and '26, I think gross margin can contribute. Recall, we used to be at 72.4% gross margin back in 2019. We're maniacally focused on getting back and improving that from where it is today and have the plans to do that. So I think the summary is, as we look to improve the 150 basis points over the 3 years, it puts us kind of at the doorstep of 28% at the end of '26, which is a nice spot to be. It puts that 30% long-term goal that we have really in focus. And all lines of the P&L could contribute along that journey. Operator : The next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Congrats on really solid finish here. Mike, maybe my one question on the EP portfolio. The 70% overall growth, 85% in the U.S., how -- can you give us a little bit of color on was there any stocking dynamic? How much of this was driven by the account openings versus a procedure uptake? And sort of related to that, does new tech add-on payment, does it matter where we are on TPT? Michael Mahoney : Yes. So the results in the U.S., 85% as you mentioned, it was really a mid-quarter launch. So the teams moved pretty quickly to have some impact in the first quarter. And we look forward to good results, obviously, in the second quarter and the rest of the year based on momentum. So there's not any big onetime stocking. So this is driven by new account openings and I would say very rapid adoption of the technology, and therefore, continued utilization of the product once they have the platform. We're also seeing multiple hospitals buying their second console, which also is a great sign because it shows the adoption and using it routinely every day. And so it's really new account openings and increased adoption once they start using the platform, and that's driving the U.S. results. And as I mentioned, in Europe, which I think is impressive, now that they have a bit more supply, they continue to open more accounts and increase the utilization of existing accounts with the FARAPULSE platform. On the TPT, we think it's a bit less significant for FARAPULSE, but it's something we'll continue to evaluate. And we'll provide you updates as we see them. Dr. Stein? Ken Stein : I described that, that's NTAP. Michael Mahoney : I'm sorry. Ken Stein : Yes. And Vijay, I think just important maybe to point out. First off, right, the NTAP applies to inpatient Medicare fee-for-service, which is really a small minority of AF ablations today. Having said that, we still do believe that FARAPULSE can use the proposed NTAP related to one of our customers. And actually, I think it's important from a physician perspective and a hospital perspective, that we're not in a position of having to create unique ICD-10 codes that are product-specific. That's really not helpful to either the physicians or the hospitals. Operator : The next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Travis Steed : Congrats again on a good quarter. I wanted to ask about the new DRG for ablation and left atrial appendage closure. And then the overall LAC market, is that -- do you think that market can kind of sustain this 20%-plus growth through -- before the indication expansions? Or do you kind of need to see those indication expansions at some point sooner rather than later? Michael Mahoney : I'll make comments and Dr. Stein. We're pleased with our WATCHMAN performance. We grew globally 19%. But keep in mind, that's coming off of nearly a 30% comp from first quarter 2023. And we still maintain, if not enhance, our strong share position. And we're excited not only with the share position but with the growth of WATCHMAN, but also some upcoming trials that can further highlight with OPTION and CHAMPION, which we believe, if successful, will significantly widen the market, TAM, for WATCHMAN. So Dr. Stein, if you want to comment on any of that and also the concomitant item. Ken Stein : Yes. Thanks, Mike. Yes. So Travis, first on the trials, I mean, first of all, this is still a healthy market. This is still a very under-penetrated therapy when you look at patients who were at high risk for stroke and AF who stand to benefit from -- with the WATCHMAN procedure. The trials that Mike mentioned, right, the first one is the OPTION trial, that evaluates the use of WATCHMAN as an alternative to oral anticoagulants following ablation. And we hope to be able to present the results of that trial late this year or early next year. Then that's followed CHAMPION, which is the all-comers trial versus the novel oral anticoagulants. Again, we expect that to report out in 2026. So these are now -- in the relatively near term that we're going to see those data points. Before that, right, I think it is worth talking a little bit about that concomitant DRG that's part of the proposed rule from CMS. We're really gratified to see that. This is something that's good for everyone. This is good for patients. This is good for hospitals. When you think of valve outpatients who are undergoing an ablation procedure, first off, I'll tell you even back when I was doing these procedures, almost every patient who came in before wanted to know would they be able to stop their oral anticoagulants, and that is still true today. And when you think about it from a patient-centered perspective, right, being able to do this all at one setting and avoiding the incremental risks that you have in undergoing two procedures, it really just makes sense. It also makes sense from a hospital standpoint when you just look at the procedural efficiencies and how that's going to help hospitals improve capacity to be doing more AF ablations and doing more WATCHMAN procedures over time. So we're excited to see this. We think this is good for patients. We think this is good for hospitals. And we look forward to getting the data out from trials like OPTION and CHAMPION that's even going to further increase the impetus for doing these procedures. Operator : The next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Danielle Antalffy : I'll also say congrats on a really strong quarter. For my one question, I wanted to look at some of the, I'll call them, legacy businesses, not sure if that's fair to describe the maybe slower-growth businesses. I mean, a CRM mid-single-digit growth is very strong. Interventional Cardiology of double digits, very strong. Just curious about how to think about those sort of slower growth in Interventional Cardiology. I'm thinking more on the drug-eluting stent portfolio, obviously, and then CRM. Can they sustain these kinds of growth profiles given that the end markets, or from a volume perspective, are arguably probably some of your slower-growth end markets? And what needs to happen from an innovation perspective to sustain that sort of growth? Michael Mahoney : Thanks, Danielle. Really appreciate you asking that question. I would say the innovation has already happened. Let me just explain a bit more. We call it ICTx, our interventional cardiology business essentially. And years ago, that was dominated by drug-eluting stents. Today, drug-eluting stents, I think, represent close to 4% of our overall mix and likely will be 3% and 2% in the following years. So it's really a very small portion of Boston Scientific and a smaller portion of ICTx. So what's driving the 13% growth within ICTx is our advanced imaging portfolio. So you're seeing more and more patients come with more complex calcium and the growing adoption of IVUS imaging, especially with our AVVIGO+ platform to identify that and help the effectiveness of these procedures. So you're seeing wide adoption in Europe of our imaging platform, wide adoption in Asia and growing adoption in the U.S. based on this new platform. So it's really the imaging capabilities as well as our complex coronary capabilities to break calcium with Wolverine and our other products. And then in Asia, they've been very successful in launching our AGENT drug-coated balloon and we recently received approval for that. We'll have some minor benefit in the second quarter '24 from that product in the U.S., where we expect enhanced growth from that product in the second half of '24 and particularly in 2025. So the team there has really done a great job of completely revamping the portfolio and the growth trajectory of ICTx. Also included in that is our Structural Heart business in Europe. And CRM, that grew 5% and we kind of essentially grow in line, I would say, with the market with pacemakers and defibrillators. S-ICD business continues to be quite robust. But the bigger growth driver in our CRM business is our diagnostics business. And we invested in that many years ago with our Preventice platform and also with our -- now our second-generation loop recorder ICM device. So we've really reshaped the portfolio significantly in both of those markets to continue to support the growth of the company. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Joshua Jennings : Wanted to ask about the EP business and just opening an update on your view of the diagnostic mapping opportunity. You initiated the NAVIGATE-PF study where the software module is going to be in play. I guess the question is really are you seeing increased demand in these early stages of PFA launch for RHYTHMIA? And just how are you viewing the opportunity for Boston to take share in this diagnostic mapping segment of the EP world? Michael Mahoney : Dr. Stein, if you could take that one? Ken Stein : Yes. It's still early in the launch. And I think one thing that I do want to sort of emphasize as you look at how things are playing out in the launch is we're really working with accounts to say don't change a lot of your workflow at the outset. Get used to using FARAPULSE, see how it works in your cases and then start modifying your workflow. So really, what we've seen early in launch really are deliberately not a big shift in whether or not people are mapping. Not a big shift in what mapping platform they're using. Now having said that, right, we have deliberately built our next-generation product and that's the FARAWAVE Nav-enabled catheter, right, that interfaces with the FARAVIEW software. And as I think everyone has seen, we've initiated our first human use studies of that earlier this year. That really will bring some unique advantages to people who want to use a navigation system as they're using FARAPULSE. It is our desire and our belief, right, that there will be people who don't feel the need to use any mapping when they're doing pulmonary vein isolation with FARAPULSE who are adopting a very efficient workflow that's been used in a lot of centers in Europe. There will be others who want to continue to use a navigation mapping system. We have no intention of forcing people to use our system. We're not going to lock it down. But this new software platform really does bring some very compelling advantages to people who will use it. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Pasquale with Nephron Research. Christopher Pasquale : How are you thinking about the opportunity for AGENT in the U.S.? And you mentioned you're still working to ramp up manufacturing capacity. When do you expect to be in a position to move into a full launch with that product? Michael Mahoney : Sure. So we have the NICE approval, excellent trial design by the clinical team and the product is doing extremely well in Japan and we have high hopes for the product has impact in the second half and more in 2025. So currently, we're really going through the contracting process with most of the big accounts in the U.S. and that's initiated. And that's going well, given there is a high unmet clinical need with in-stent restenosis and the deliverability that's been proven with AGENT. So there's high physician demand for it. But we are going through the contracting process with the major health systems now, and you'll start seeing some sales in the second quarter. And we expect that to ramp more significantly throughout the second half of the year and accelerate more in '25. Ken Stein : Yes. And Chris, and just to remind everyone, right? Our current label indication in the U.S. in-stent restenosis, that comprises approximately 10% of current PCI volume. Internationally, we also see DCBs used and we believe there is a potential use case outside of in-stent restenosis, small vessel disease, bifurcation lesions, potentially even some acute coronary syndrome. And once we launch in the U.S., we are evaluating opportunities to expand the label. And those expanded indications could potentially take us up to 20% of current PCI volume. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Matthew O'Brien: I don't have perfect numbers here, but in looking at the U.S. EP number in Q1, it looks like you did somewhere around $40 million in FARAPULSE revenue between the generator and the catheter itself. Is that roughly the right number? And then when I start to carry this out through the rest of the year plus the guidance increase, I'm getting something more like $300 million to even $400 million of FARAPULSE this year. Is that around the right number? And can you manufacture enough product to support that? Michael Mahoney : Yes. We won't confirm your math. At this point, we're not going to be breaking out FARAPULSE cases, numbers, number of accounts, dollars and so forth yet. If you recall back to the WATCHMAN days, we really waited till it was about close to $1 billion platform before we provided that based on the materiality of the company. But it's going extremely well. And importantly, we made significant investments in the supply chain 2 and 3 years ago to be ready for where we are today. And the supply chain team continues to perform extremely well, and they're able thus far to meet the demand in Europe and the U.S. and the future in Asia. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Matthew Taylor : I actually wanted to follow up on your AGENT commentary. Two small questions. One is, can you talk about the materiality in Japan? And when you mentioned the indication expansions, could you talk about what those could look like and when we could see them in the U.S.? Michael Mahoney : Just maybe really not a whole lot of new color in Japan. But they launched it last year and it was adopted very, very quickly and it's leading to the strong double-digit growth in Japan that we saw in the quarter. In terms of indication expansion, Dr. Stein, do you want to take that one? Ken Stein : Yes, Matt. Again, I think probably the first new indications we think about looking for would be small vessel bifurcation lesions. Still working through regulatory strategy on that. So not prepared to give you a time line for when we would initiate any of that work. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Matthew Miksic : Just maybe one follow-up on the cadence for FARAPULSE this year in the U.S. and sort of how the RHYTHMIA adoption navigation kind of plays into that. Any color for what we can expect as you get into the rest of the quarters would be great. Michael Mahoney : Thanks, Matt. Probably not too much new commentary here. I think in FARAPULSE overall, it's -- we're developing very strong capabilities to install, support and train doctors and really scale that up in the U.S., given the high demand for it. And we're able -- resource-wise, we put a lot of focus on that as we continue to expand that. And there obviously are a lot of strong relationships we have with those EPs given our WATCHMAN experience and our CRM experience. So it's a lot of resource planning and training and executing every day in the field to open up new accounts. Dr. Stein gave some commentary on the mapping. So today, some accounts don't use mapping when they're driving maybe optimal workflow and many accounts are using their existing mapping system. And we don't intend to force our customers to move away. However, we do -- as Dr. Stein mentioned, based on what we've seen with the our mapping navigation system, we do think there will be incremental clinical benefits and productivity gains in using that. So we are starting to see an increase in RHYTHMIA orders, and we anticipate enhanced RHYTHMIA -- FARAPULSE mapping orders as we go through the second half of this year because there will be clinical benefits from it. But as Dr. Stein mentioned, we really want to have hospitals choose the correct mapping system and FARAPULSE works excellent today with the competitors, but we would expect some enhanced benefit with ours. Operator : And just to verify, is there time for one last question? Jonathan Monson : Yes, Drew. We'll take one more, please. Operator : That will come from Michael Polark with Wolfe Research. Michael Polark : I want to ask the gross margin commentary, the inventory charges, Dan. Can you quantify the impact in the quarter? And what's the nature of those charges? What's going on? And the other thing I heard was increased mix of capital in the quarter. I think it seems highly likely to be FARAPULSE generator driven, but if there's anything else underneath that comment, I'd welcome the color. Daniel Brennan : Sure. Thanks for the question, Mike. We're not going to quantify the inventory charges, but it was much more than we're used to in a given quarter, and that's why we called it out and it has an impact. I will say a piece of it, not an insignificant piece of it, is kind of due to the success of FARAPULSE. So it's not kind of all bad per se relative to our results, but it's still inventory charges and it still reduced the gross margin in the quarter. But that's what gives me the confidence and the optimism that heading into the rest of the year, we won't see inventory charges at the level that we saw them in Q1 as we go through 2024.  On the capital, yes, a piece of that is related to FARAPULSE. But we also -- as Mike mentioned, we also have a really successful launch in our IVUS business, which has some capital with it. And not insignificantly as well, we have some in the Urology business associated with the Lumenis. So it was probably led by the launch of FARAPULSE, but we did have a little bit more in some of the other launches in some of the other businesses with respect to capital. But overall message should be 69.8%, a little lower than we would have liked, but still have a goal this year of getting back to that 70.7% or slightly below that for the year for gross margin. Jonathan Monson : All right. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific.

Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jon Monson, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jon Monson : Thank you, Drew, and welcome everyone and thanks for joining us today. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q2 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in this release. We have posted a link to that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials and Filings. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike and Dan will provide comments on Q2 performance as well as the outlook for our business, including Q3 and full year 2024 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and organic revenue further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales. Relevant acquisitions and divestitures excluded for organic growth are the majority stake investment in Acotec Scientific Holdings Limited and the acquisitions of Apollo Endosurgery and Relievant Medsystems, which closed in February, April and November 2023 respectively, as well as our acquisition of the Endoluminal Vacuum Therapy portfolio from B. Braun, which closed in March 2024. Divestitures include the Endoscopy, Pathology business, which closed in April 2023. Guidance excludes the previously-announced agreement to acquire Axonics and Silk Road Medical both of which are expected to close in the second half of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. For more information, please refer to the Q2 Financial and Operational Highlights deck, which may be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. On this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified, are organic. This call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal Securities Law, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, may, believe, estimate, and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new and anticipated product approvals and launches, acquisitions, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use of cash, our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. If our underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect or if certain risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them except as required by law. At this point, I'll turn over to Mike. Mike? Michael F. Mahoney: Thanks, Jon and thank you everyone for joining us today. Our second quarter results exceeded our expectations, led by the strength of our differentiated global cardiovascular portfolio, particularly the execution in AF Solutions and the winning spirit of our global team. In second quarter, total company operational sales grew 16, organic sales grew 15, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of 10 to 12. Our top tier growth continues to be fueled by innovation, clinical evidence generation, and our strategy of category leadership. Consistent with prior quarters, most of our businesses and regions grew well above market. Second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.62 grew 15% versus 2023, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.57 to $0.59. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 27.2% and as a result of our first half margin performance and revenue upside versus previous expectations, we now expect to expand adjusted operating margin 50 to 70 basis points for the full year. Turning to the third quarter and full year 2024 outlook, we're guiding to organic growth of 13% to 15% for third quarter and raising our full year guidance from 10% to 12% to 13% to 14%, reflecting momentum across our broad portfolio, particularly in our EP business unit. Our third quarter adjusted EPS guidance is $0.57 to $0.59 and we expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $2.38 to $2.42, representing growth of 16% to 18%. Dan will provide more details on our financials and I'll provide some additional color on the quarter and the outlook for the second half of 2024. Regionally and on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 17% in second quarter with exceptional growth in EP, fueled by the continuous success of the FARAPULSE launch, as well as Watchman, coronary imaging, and strengthen our med-surg businesses. Europe grew 16% on an operational basis versus second quarter 2023. This impressive performance was driven by double-digit growth in seven of our eight business units, led by robust growth in EP and strength across our growth and emerging markets. Second quarter was also a record quarter in the region for our structural heart business, following positive data presented on ACURATE Neo2 at the recent Euro PCR Conference. We expect this momentum to continue, supported by the launch of the largest size ACURATE prime valve in late 2024. Asia-Pac grew 13% operationally versus a difficult comp in second quarter 2023, with excellent performance in China, growing high teens, and Japan growing double digits. We also recently received approval in China for FARAPULSE and AGENT Drug-Coated Balloon, and continue to expect approval for FARAPULSE in Japan in the second half of this year. We expect the contribution from these launches will ramp over 2025. Within the quarter, pricing actions in key geographies went into effect with a China VBP on coronary imaging, and Japan reimbursement cuts in June. We do expect Asia-Pac to grow low double digits in the second half of the year, including the full impact of these pricing actions. Some additional commentary on the business units. Our urology business grew 9% organically in the quarter with double digit growth in stone management and prosthetic urology, supported by our direct-to-patient efforts, driving patient awareness, and early contribution from the limited market release of the Tenacio Pump. International growth of 14% was driven by laser therapies and Rezum. We look forward to closing this previously announced acquisition of Axonics, which we are continuing to expect in the second half of this year. Endoscopy sales grew 8% both operationally and organically in second quarter. Second quarter results were driven by above market growth in our Biliary franchise, led by high teens growth in AXIOS, and the high teens growth in our Endoluminal Surgery franchise. We continue to expect Endo sales to go faster than the market throughout 2024, enabled by our innovative portfolio. Neuromodulation sales grew 16% operationally and 4% organically in the quarter. Our Brain franchise grew low single digits with some impact from competitive product launches. We expect this business to strengthen in the second half of the year, driven by our portfolio of differentiated technologies. In second quarter, our pain franchise grew strong double digits operationally and mid single digits on an organic basis. Our spinal cord stem business saw improved U.S. trialing cadence in the quarter and we expect that our U.S. SCS franchise will improve in the second half of the year. The relieving business continues to perform extremely well with more than 30,000 patients treated with the Intracept System to date. Peripheral Intervention sales grew 12% operationally and 9% organically versus second quarter. High single digit growth in Arterial was driven by continued momentum in our drug-eluting portfolio, with double digit growth in the quarter. Mid single digit growth in Venous was driven by momentum of EKOS supported by the real PE data set and continued double digit growth in Varithena. Our Interventional Oncology franchise grew double digits in second quarter, driven by our broad offering across embolization and cancer therapies. Looking forward, we continue to expect to close the previously announced acquisition of Silk Road Medical in the second half of this year. Cardiology; cardiology delivered another excellent quarter with organic sales growing 22% versus second quarter 2023. Within cardiology, interventional cardiology therapy sales grew 9%. Growth in coronary therapies was driven by continued strength in our global imaging franchise and APAC calcium franchise. Within the quarter we initiated a limited launch of AGENT DCB in the U.S., which has received positive initial physician feedback. Our structural heart valves franchise grew strong double digits in the second quarter, led by ACURATE Neo2, which continues to see growth from both new and existing accounts in Europe and Latin America. At the end of the quarter, we also completed follow-up of the full 1,500 patient cohort and the U.S. ACURATE IDE trial. We now expect to present this data in the first half of 2025 likely at the Annual ACC Meeting. Watchman had another excellent quarter growing 20% organically with strong contribution from the ongoing launch of Watchman FLX Pro in the U.S. and Japan. The U.S. grew 20% led by further penetration into the existing indicated patient population enabled by our innovation, clinical evidence, and patient awareness efforts. Cardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 3% organically in the quarter. In second quarter, our Diagnostics franchise grew double digits. This above-market growth was driven by our broad cardiac diagnostics portfolio. In Core CRM, our high and low voltage business grew low single digits with strong international growth partially offset by slightly below market growth in the U.S. At the recent HRS Meeting, data was presented from the MODULAR ATP Trial of the MODULAR CRM System, which is comprised of the EMPOWER Leadless Pacemaker and EMBLEM SICD, which met all pre-specified six-month endpoints and a high rate of ATP success with no patient requests for deactivation of pacing due to pain or discomfort. Turning to EP. EP sales grew an impressive 125% organically versus second quarter 2023, driven by the rapid and sustained adoption of the transformative FARAPULSE PFA System. Second quarter sales were driven by outstanding commercial execution, robust supply, and positive real-world outcomes, as well as increased AF ablation volumes, supported by the efficiency of the FARAPULSE workflow. Our Baylis Access Solutions business also continues to see strong double-digit growth in the U.S. with utilization in approximately 80% of PFA procedures and approximately 85% of Watchman procedures. Internationally, we saw continued FARAPULSE account openings and robust utilization in Europe and launched APAC markets. Importantly, evidence of more than 20,000 patients treated with FARAPULSE has been published or presented at medical conferences, demonstrating the safety, efficacy, and reproducibility of the system. And within the quarter, we completed an enrollment in the NAVIGATE-PF study of the FARAVIEW software module and FARAWAVE Nav-enabled catheter, both of which are expected to launch in the U.S. during the second half of the year. At the recent HRS meeting, outcomes from a sub-analysis of the ADVENT trial were presented. This is the very first randomized data for a PFA system demonstrating superior efficacy versus thermal modalities, with significantly more patients having achieved an arterial arrhythmic burden of less than 0.1% with FARAPULSE compared to RF and Cryo. We plan to continue a steady cadence of clinical evidence generation to maintain our PFA leadership, including Rematch-AF, a planned trial designed to study the FARAPOINT and FARAWAVE catheter in patients who need a redo ablation, which we expect to begin enrolling early in 2025. In closing, I'm very grateful to our global team for the commitment and winning spirit, enabling us to deliver life-changing technologies to millions of patients. We're in the most exciting chapters as a company with a track record of executing or exceeding our financial goals while delivering meaningful innovation. With that, I'll hand it over to Dan. Daniel J. Brennan: Thanks, Mike. Second quarter 2024 consolidated revenue of $4.120 billion represents 14.5% reported growth versus second quarter 2023 and includes a 160 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, which was slightly unfavorable, versus our expectations. Excluding this $57 million foreign exchange headwind, operational revenue growth was 16.1% in the quarter. The sales impact from closed acquisitions was 140 basis points, resulting in 14.7% organic revenue growth, exceeding our second quarter guidance range of 10% to 12%. Q2 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $0.62, grew 15.4% versus 2023, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.57 to $0.59, primarily driven by our strong sales performance. Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 70.4%, contracting 160 basis points versus the prior year period, driven by higher than expected inventory charges related to the POLARx cryoablation system, given the strong commercial adoption of FARAPULSE in the U.S., as well as increased levels of capital placements in the quarter. We continue to expect second half adjusted gross margin to be higher than the first half, driven by the mixed benefit from key product launches and full recognition of our annual standard cost improvements. We expect full-year adjusted gross margin to be slightly below our 2023 rate. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 27.2%, which expanded 40 basis points versus the prior year period. Given our strong first half operating margin and our expectations for the second half, we are raising our full-year 2024 adjusted operating margin expansion goal to 50 to 70 basis points from 30 to 50 basis points compared to 2023. We believe this strikes a nice balance of delivering incremental margin from our sales upside and continuing to invest appropriately to drive strong top line performance. On a GAAP basis, second quarter operating margin was 12.6%, which included intangible asset impairment charges related to the acquisitions of Cryterion Medical and Devoro Medical. The Cryterion impairment charges were related to the high conversion rates of cryoablation to FARAPULSE for ablation procedures in the U.S. The Devoro impairment charges were related to the decision to discontinue work advancing the Wolf thrombectomy platform. Moving to below the line, second quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $68 million, which was favorable to our expectations. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the second quarter was 13.1%, which includes favorable discrete tax items. Our operational tax rate for the quarter was 13.6%. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1.484 billion shares in the second quarter. Free cash flow for the second quarter was $660 million with $814 million from operating activities, less $155 million in net capital expenditures, which includes payments of $200 million related to acquisitions, restructuring, litigation, and other special items. In 2024, we continue to expect full year free cash flow to exceed $2 billion, which includes approximately $700 million of expected payments related to special items. As of June 30, 2024 we had cash on hand of $2.9 billion and our gross debt leverage ratio was 2.4 times. Our top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A, followed by annual share repurchases to offset dilution from employee stock grants. In alignment with our acquisition strategy, in Q2 we announced our agreement to acquire Silk Road Medical and closed the acquisition of SoundCath [ph], a pre-revenue, privately held medical technology company developing an intracardiac echocardiography product complementing our existing electrophysiology portfolio. Our legal reserve was $251 million as of June 30th, a decrease of $32 million versus Q1 2024. $54 million of this reserve is already funded through our qualified settlement funds. I will now walk through guidance for Q3 and full year 2024. We expect full year 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 13.5% to 14.5% versus 2023. Excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, we expect full year 2024 operational revenue growth to be 14.5% to 15.5%. Excluding a 150 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full year 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 13% to 14% versus 2023. We expect third quarter 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 13% to 15% versus third quarter 2023. Excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, we expect third quarter 2024 operational revenue growth to be 14% to 16%. Excluding a 100 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect third quarter 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 13% to 15% versus 2023. We now expect full year 2024 adjusted below the line expenses to be approximately $300 million. Given discrete items recognized in the first half of 2024, we now expect a full year 2024 operational tax rate of approximately 13.5% and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 12.5%, which contemplates current legislation, including enacted laws and issued guidance under OECD pillar two rules. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.38 to $2.42, representing growth of 16% to 18% versus 2023, including an approximate $0.04 headwind from foreign exchange, which is unchanged from our previous expectations. We expect third quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.57 to $0.59. For more information, please check our investor relations website for Q2 2024 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q2 results and 2024 guidance. And with that, I'll turn it back to Jon, who will moderate the Q&A. Jon Monson : Thanks, Dan. Drew, let's open it up for questions for the next 40 minutes or so. In order for us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Drew, please go ahead. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Robbie Marcus with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Robert Marcus : Oh, thank you and congratulations on another fantastic quarter here. Michael F. Mahoney: Thanks, Robbie. Daniel J. Brennan: Thanks, Robbie. Robert Marcus : With my one question, I want to ask about guidance and the sustainability. This is a, it was a big quarter. You had a big first quarter. PFA is clearly outperforming. Watchman had a great quarter. A lot of the rest of the business continues to fire on all cylinders. So I'm seeing about 14% organic for the back half of the year, which is a really healthy rate. And I guess really the question is, how do you feel about continuing through 2024 and really into 2025, is this a pull forward of the revenues expected in the long range plan, or do you think there's better demand, better market adoption, better volumes underlying pricing that could keep maybe not 14%, but something elevated for the foreseeable future? Thanks. Michael F. Mahoney: Sure, Rob. I'll take a shot at. We're not going to give 2025 guidance here but at our Investor Day, we said our goal was to be the highest performing med tech company in terms of sales and EPS growth, which we believe we did in 2023. Our aim is to do that in 2024 and our aim is to do that for many years to come. And I think one is the primary drivers of you've seen the decade-long portfolio shift into faster-growth markets for the company, where weighted average market growth rate is probably closer to 7% to 8% versus what it used to be kind of flat. So one, we enjoy because of our portfolio choices, faster growing markets. Secondly, we have strong growth across the world. You're seeing Europe double digits, Asia Pac double digits where FARAPULSE is not yet launched. And obviously, the U.S. doing quite well as well. And then I think you just have to look at the durability of other businesses. We'll likely talk about FARAPULSE and WATCHMAN a lot on the call, but you see continued strong growth, 8% to 9%-ish through the first half within our MedSurg businesses. So that kind of gets diminished because of the strength of some other areas, but that's pretty good. And then the cardiovascular portfolio is just getting stronger and stronger. With our EP franchise, Baylis, what we're doing with coronary with Drug-Coated Balloon, you saw the results with ACURATE in Europe, and also potentially some benefits with concomitant reimbursement in the future. And who knows, maybe these procedures may move over time to an ASC center and EP, which also, we think would benefit Boston Scientific given our solution. So we had a tough comp in 2023 with a 12%. Our guidance for the full year is now 13% to 14%. We won't give 2025 guidance, but our goal is to be really distinguish ourselves from the peer group in terms of revenue growth and EPS, and we have the portfolio and the team to do it. Robert Marcus : Appreciate the thoughts, thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you so much for taking the question and I echo a very nice quarter. Can we unpack just a little bit and you may not like this question, but I get it a lot, what's next, and how do we think about -- to your point, we're going to talk about FARAPULSE and Watchman a lot, but people are now sort of looking forward at how does this continue to roll out to deliver this kind of growth? And thank you. Michael F. Mahoney: Yes. I think it's -- thanks, Joanne. I think it's similar to some of the themes I just highlighted. We have -- we're in a higher weighted average market growth rate markets to start. We see consistent procedure volume around the world. We are in a pricing environment where we used to be a price giver, pretty significantly. Now it's getting closer to negative 1 to 0. We also expect on the margin front, we took our margin goals up for the year. We expect gross margin to improve over time. Right now, we're getting more margin benefit from SG&A primarily, which is good leverage. We would expect to get more gross margin upside over the LRP period and we just have a very strong product cadence in very fast-growing markets. Two of the best markets in all of MEDTECH, obviously are our EP and WATCHMAN and we have strong leadership position in PFA and that market is only growing. And we are going to launch that in Asia. And we have a lot of clinical work going on with WATCHMAN, as you know, to significantly increase the TAM of that market where it'll rival the TAVI market, three to five years from now. So the clinical evidence that we have in fast-growing market is different in the portfolio, and we continue to make and place strong M&A bets with Axonics and Silk and our venture portfolio, which we'll continue to leverage. So the playbook hasn't changed, but it's the execution of the team of continually putting this in better markets and out-executing the competition. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Lawrence Biegelsen : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a really nice quarter here. Mike, maybe just to drill down on EP and FARAPULSE. I guess it's a similar question, but just the sustainability here of the growth and the share. By our math, it looks like you've captured about 15% of the U.S. EP market in the second quarter, excluding Baylis. Help us understand how durable your EP share and growth is, can EP continue to be a growth driver for Boston Scientific for years to come and what's driving your confidence you can compete effectively with Athera [ph] and VeraPulse [ph] when they launch? Thank you. Michael F. Mahoney: So I'll start and then Dr. Stein can maybe talk about how we're really leading the field in our clinical evidence and some of the physician comment. We're competing with those companies today in Europe. With J&J, with all the companies that have PFA platforms. And you've heard us talk on many calls now on the differentiation of FARAPULSE in terms of its safety profile, the clinical data and the -- really, the usage of physicians who never considered using Boston Scientific EP prior, many of them have completely converted to using FARAPULSE for their A-fibrillation procedures. But we're still relatively early in our launch in the U.S. It's less than six months of launching in the U.S. and we have yet to launch in China, and we've yet to launch in Japan, and we have a lot more to do in Europe and we have additional indications coming and additional portfolio coming. So we think the short story is the FARAPULSE platform, combined with Baylis, combined with our clinical will be a differentiated growth driver for Boston for many years to come. Now will it grow as it continues to scale up over 100% a quarter, unlikely, but we expect this to be maybe the biggest business of Boston Scientific in the years to come here. Kenneth Stein : And Larry, maybe just to sort of add on Mike said first just -- I mean, AF is the most common sustained arrhythmia in the world. Ablation therapy for AF today is still dramatically underpenetrated, right. I mean ablation, high single-digit penetration for persistent afib, low double-digit penetration for paroxysmal afib and the safety advantages, the efficacy advantages, the efficiency advantages and just the overall simplicity of the FARAPULSE system, I think are just going to continue to drive the size of that market and penetration into that market. In terms of the competition, right, again, we do expect to see competitors bring out their first-generation products late this year, early next year, they're already approved in Europe. And frankly, as Mike said earlier, right, we have not seen that materially impact the rapid sustained adoption of FARAPULSE in Europe. And FARAPULSE is a transformative technology with really important differentiated advantages against these competitors. As Mike said, right, treated over 70,000 patients to date, published clinical trial data on over 20,000 patients to date, which really testifies to the safety, to the simplicity, to the efficiency and again, Mike referred to the data we presented at Heart Rhythm Society. It's the only system right now with any data testifying to actually superiority in an efficacy measure against traditional ablation. Lawrence Biegelsen : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead. Jon Monson : Hey Rick, can you hear us. Frederick Wise : Hi, there, can you hear me. Jon Monson : Yes, we can hear you now. Frederick Wise : Great, sorry about that. I was hoping also to talk about PFA from another perspective. In my recent doc checks I've heard a great deal of encouraging interest in RHYTHMIA. And obviously, in many cases that are being mapped now with other companies' systems. Just maybe give us some more color on when you launch your mapping integrated catheter in the second half, I assume that's still the target. How do we think about the implications for RHYTHMIA adoption for the percentage of cases that could be mapped on the RHYTHMIA system and the impact on your growth outlook as a result? Thank you. Kenneth Stein : Yes. Thanks, Rick. I appreciate the question. Again, we still are projecting approval of both our NAV-enabled FARAWAVE catheter and a completely new software suite on RHYTHMIA that we're calling FARAVIEW to help support that. And we certainly do expect that to help drive more adoption of the use of RHYTHMIA and FARAVIEW to accompany FARAWAVE. Now I want to begin though by saying, FARAPULSE will remain an open system. We want to support workflows that don't involve any use of mapping or navigation, support workflows that involve these competitive systems, but also we'll expect with FARAVIEW and FARAWAVE NAV to provide some major advantages in terms of workflow. I think important for me I think emphasize that existing mapping and navigation systems don't understand PFA at all. They were built around an RF ablation paradigm. And so FARAVIEW is going to be the first software and a mapping system that fundamentally understands what we do with PFA and with FARAPULSE. There are some important features, dynamic visualization of the catheter as it changes shape from basket flower configuration, field tagging specific to PFA energy. I think when you put all of that together it has the potential to minimize the use of fluoroscopy during these procedures, minimize catheter exchanges, and really continue what we've tried to do and I think have accomplished with FARAPULSE to begin, right, which is to create a procedure that is safer, that is at least as effective, and that is far more simple and efficient compared to what people have been doing with legacy systems. Michael F. Mahoney: And on the financial side, as you know, you've seen some of the competitive reports. Mapping is a sizable chunk of the overall EP procedure. And when FARAPULSE is being used, you're seeing increased procedure volume based on the efficiency. So some competitors are benefiting from that productivity gain of FARAPULSE. So in addition to strong utilization rates and opening new centers, more broadly impacted in 2025, we do expect a number of physicians to adopt this Fairview platform that Ken said which is additional revenue that you're not seeing today in the FARAPULSE EP procedure. Frederick Wise : That\u2019s great. Thank you so much. Operator : The next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions and my congratulations on the experience here. I had one question on U.S. PFA, the 220% growth. Can you parse what was capital contribution versus catheter contribution in the U.S. number. And I think you mentioned a TPT for -- in the U.S., in the outpatient setting, any update on has Boston submitted its TPT? thank you. Michael F. Mahoney: Yes. So thanks for the question. Unfortunately, we're not going to break out for you the capital and disposable. Disposable is obviously more sizable than the capital, but that's probably the color we'll provide on that. And on the overall pricing, as you do know the pricing is a bit of a premium. But based on the clinical benefits and efficacy and efficiency that physicians and customers are enjoying that seemed to be the proper price point. And on TPT, Ken, do you have any comments on that? Kenneth Stein : Yes, Vijay. So we have submitted for TPT. Again, I think important to recognize there are some very strict criteria for eligibility for TPT. And I think just to reiterate what Mike said, which is, right now, we are not seeing pricing as a barrier to the rapid and sustained adoption of FARAPULSE. Operator : Next question comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. David Roman : Thank you and good morning. I want to keep going a little bit on the EP side. But also, could you talk a little bit more about both the technology and commercial strategy and as you think about the technology side, right now, the bulk of your business right now sits in the ablation side. You talked a little bit about the importance of mapping and access. But how should we think about the portfolio evolving and how that unlocks new opportunities for you, whether that's in the non-AF side of the ablation market, be it with FARAPOINT or some of the other products? And then on the commercial side, where are the opportunities for pull-through here, so for example, are you training your mappers on generator replacements and ICDs and how should we think about the overall benefit to the portfolio? Michael F. Mahoney: Again, I guess Ken and I will try to tag team this. Thank you for the question. It's maybe the best market in med tech. It's about a $10 billion market. The chunk that we're doing well in now is the $6 billion afib market that we continue to strengthen, and we'll get approval, as you know in Asia impact in 2025. There are a number of other areas that we're trying to move into the mapping segment based on the previous commentary is one. We do have an organic ICE program, which we hopefully will -- which is a 510(k) product, hopefully, we'll be competitive with the new ICE platform during this LRP period, which is another large slice of it. And Ken can probably detail out a bit more the clinical studies that we're doing to widen the indication for FARAPULSE beyond what is used today. Kenneth Stein : Yes. Thanks, Mike. So David, let me start with the clinical strategy and then maybe say a little more about where we're going from a technology standpoint as well because I think it's important, right. That all the other stuff we're doing doesn't just get lost in the excitement around FARAPULSE as exciting as FARAPULSE is. From clinical trial standpoint, to begin with our ADVANTAGE clinical trial, which is aimed to get labeling for FARAPULSE persistent Afib has completed enrollment. We expect to present those results late this year, early next year. We are well underway in a trial called AVANT GUARD , which is aimed to prove that FARAPULSE used as first-line therapy for patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. We've announced the intent to run a trial called REMATCH, which will look at FARAPULSE for redo ablations. From a technology standpoint, we've already talked about the FARAWAVE NAV catheter. In addition to that, we have a point catheter, FARAPOINT that's through its clinical trial. And then down the road, I think more sophisticated catheters for both mapping and ablation catheter called FARAFLEX. And I think as you can imagine, we are interested in the use of this for many arrhythmias beyond atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia, that pretty much you name it. But I don't want some of the other technology innovations to get lost. And so right, the EP performance was not only a FARAPULSE story, fantastic performance from our Access Solutions portfolio. And in terms of pull-through, right, see very good synergy between FARAPULSE and the Access solution products, likewise, in really good synergy between the WATCHMAN and the Access Solution products. Again, I think in terms of the pull-through question, with the most obvious opportunity, as Mike mentioned, is the opportunity now to have reimbursement in the U.S. for concomitant FARAPULSE ablation and WATCHMAN procedures, which we expect will be a growth driver and hope to see that finalized before the end of this year by CMS. Again, Dan mentioned our acquisition of SoundCath, so an ICE product to support EP procedures and potentially also WATCHMAN procedures, probably just a very long-winded way of saying we love FARAPULSE, but it is far from the only story. Operator : The next question comes from Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Patrick Wood : Fabulous, thank you. And on that note, I might flip the script if that's alright with everybody. And maybe switch to something a little different. Obviously, you guys announced Silk and appreciate that hasn't closed yet, but I'd love if you could unpack what was so exciting for you guys in TCAR and that asset overall and the ability to flip WALLSTENT into the package and how meaningful that is relative to just the capacity to plug it into Boston overall and drive sales? Anything around that would be great. Michael F. Mahoney: Sure. Silk is really a terrific asset we've looked at for a long time. Hopefully, we aim to close that in the second half this year. As a stand-alone business, they were really kind of leading the rejuvenation of that field through their clinical evidence and their performance over many years in the U.S. And it came to a point where we felt it was mature enough in terms of its sales ramp and for us to acquire it at the right price. So I guess, first of all, it always starts with clinical indications. We're really pleased with the data and the long-term durability of this procedure. So as a stand-alone company, they're growing certainly accretive to Boston Scientific faster, but clearly not there on the margin front. So now in Boston Scientific sense we feel like we can grow the company faster in the U.S. given the category leadership portfolio we have and a common call point with a vascular surgeon. We also have the ability to take it outside the U.S. to appropriate countries. And we also aim to improve the margin profile of the business by integrating the company as appropriately within our operations supply chain team like we've done for many other acquisitions in the past. So it's an accretive asset that we think will be stronger and more profitable in the hands of Boston and make us more important for the vascular surgeon, which is an area that as the needs improvement for us, I would say, within that business unit. So now we have the lever -- not the leverage, but the capabilities to present to vascular surgeons our broader PI portfolio, given the relationships that the Silk Road team has with the vascular surgeon. Patrick Wood : Brilliant, thanks Mike. Operator : The next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Travis Steed : Hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask, given the strong margin guide raise and EPS guide raise here, where you're at kind of on the FARAPULSE getting those to full margins and the scale there. Are you halfway there, kind of more or less and your willingness to kind of continue to let that flow through? And I also wanted to ask about TAVR. It felt like a little bit of a time change and tone change on TAVR, so I just wanted to make sure we didn't miss anything on the TAVR update? Daniel J. Brennan: Sure. I can start on the gross margin and then Mike can take the TAVR one. So where are we on the journey? As Mike said, we're early in the journey in the United States relative to the FARAPULSE launch. That corresponds pretty well with the gross margin story. So if you think of where we are, the standard margin for FARAPULSE is absolutely accretive relative to the catheter. So that's a great accretive gross margin growth driver. The things that in the initial stages are a little bit dilutive are obviously, you heard me talk about the inventory charges with respect to POLARx. So we don't want to take inventory charges, but when it's -- when you're taking them as a result of the success of FARAPULSE, that's -- it should be temporary and should not be something that continues. So those should get better over time. The manufacturing brands, so we have built our manufacturing capacity and our operations and supply chain team to be the leaders in this space. So we have significant capacity. So as we're making the product today, it's a little under absorbed relative to that. So that will get better, obviously, as we make more and that's obviously our plan. And then the capital placements are dilutive. Again, it's not a huge number relative to the overall gross margin for the company, but it does at the edges, kind of take that down a bit. So overall, I would say FARAPULSE, every quarter, FARAPULSE will be a better contributor to margin. And I think as you get into 2025 and 2026, it will be a significantly accretive growth driver for gross margin for the company. Michael F. Mahoney: On TAVI, the European team has done really an outstanding quarter and outstanding quarters back to back with ACURATE Neo2, over 20% growth. Importantly, we expect to launch in fourth quarter or maybe first quarter 2025 Prime, which is our next-generation ACURATE Neo2 that has all risk indications and the full-size matrix, which has been the challenge for us to date with an optimized delivery in the valve frame. On the -- just to reiterate on the U.S. timing, we did complete enrollment of the 1,500 patient cohort. And we do expect to present the data in the first half of 2025 likely at the ACC meeting. I think it's important to note that this is the largest randomized trial that's been done in TAVI really based on the timing of the last patient follow-up and the size of the trial and the multiple risk and mixed control groups that we have in it. It's an extensive trial and we believe that the first half 2025 and likely at ACC is the appropriate timing. Daniel J. Brennan: And then just as a quick follow-up to the gross margin question, Travis. None of that is a surprise relative to gross margin. So we've been saying all along the gross margin is not likely to help the margin improvement story in 2024. But lo and behold, we're able to increase the overall operating margin from 30 to 50 to 50 to 70. So I think all is well on the margin expansion front. Really proud of that 50 to 70 relative to the guidance for this year. And as you look to 2025 and beyond, I think gross margin, I think all lines of the P&L can contribute to the margin expansion journey and gross margin will be one of those. Travis Steed : Great, very helpful. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Joshua Jennings : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking the questions and congrats on the stellar results. Wanted to just follow up on Travis' two questions. I guess, first on TAVR, could we see top line data before the ACC presentation next year and could Boston file before that presentation? And then just the other follow-up is just on the profitability you guys you're seeing in a lot of profitability flow through on the outperformance on the top line. I wanted to just get a sense of taking some of that profitability and reinvesting that, where could we see -- where some of those dollars going and just some high-level commentary on that reinvestment driving -- supporting this sustainability of top-tier revenue growth in the med tech space? Thanks for taking the questions. Kenneth Stein : Yes, Josh, maybe I'll take the TAVR question first and then let Dan and Mike take the others. Just really what Mike said, last patient follow-up in the trial was just in this quarter, it's a very large, very complex trial. And just honestly, based on the timing of getting the data cleaned and getting the readouts from all of the various core labs [ph] that are engaged in getting us the analysis for the trial, we are going to miss the abstract deadlines for all of the major fall meetings. So those deadlines literally come up within a couple of weeks. And again, these data are so important and pivotal, right, we want to present this at a major meeting. And so right, the first major cardiology meeting, where we'll be able to meet an abstract deadline is going to be the ACC. Would not expect you to see any data released ahead of that. Daniel J. Brennan: And the second part of your question relative to the balance between reinvesting the sales upside and dropping some through. I think you're seeing the evidence of that here in our guidance raise for the 50 to 70. So I think we've struck a really good balance on that. So we've had sales upside during the year and the realization that we closed the first half a little bit ahead of expectations. So we're giving some of that back. So we're taking the 30 to 50 to the 50 to 70. So that's great. At the same time, we are reinvesting in the business, primarily in the commercial facing functions. We're leveraging the back office and the administrative areas, which makes sense. We don't need to grow those when you're growing the revenue at the rate that we're at. So we've got significant leverage opportunities there. And then as Mike said, this isn't just reinvesting in FARAPULSE. This is reinvesting across the whole portfolio, the broad portfolio that we have. So we picked the right spots to reinvest to be able to continue to deliver that top line performance for the long term. And I think we're striking a nice balance there. Operator : The next question comes from Daniel Antalffy with UBS. Please go ahead. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. And I'll be a broken record here. Congrats on the really awesome quarter. Mike, I wanted to go in a different direction here away from PFA for a second and talk about how we should think, just on this theme of sustainability of growth into 2025, appreciating we'll give guidance here. But if we think about AGENT DCB launching back half of this year and Modular in the back half or, I guess, is that launching this year as well. So how do we think about those contributing maybe elevating CRM growth above the market in next year as well as the Interventional Cardiology portfolio? Thanks so much. Michael F. Mahoney: Thank you for pointing that out because I was getting hammered by tax from our agent team and our CRM team for not mentioning those in the prior question. So I think if you were to continue to add on that discussion, which is how do we maintain and sustain high performance, that's highly differentiated from the peer group for the -- for many years to come. It's all the things we talked about before with PFA and WATCHMAN indication expansion. And as you said, with the AGENT, kudos to that team, they're really transforming that portfolio. Drug-eluting stents next year will probably be 2% of overall Boston Scientific. And you're seeing tremendous growth in our imaging business with our IVUS imaging platform. And now we're the first one to have approval for AGENTS, and that TPT decision will be made soon and apply and hopefully, in January. And that is a market that we plan to drive where we have a multiyear advantage, where we have superiority data for what is at least 10% of the market with restenosis and appropriate price points. That's going to accelerate the growth of that division and significantly improve the margin profile over time. Why we continue to invest in clinical science and our structural heart portfolio and also, we have a very vast VC portfolio. And oftentimes, those VC investments come with dilution, which our team is able to manage consistently while investing for the future, while improving margins at the same time. So I think that's a big part of it. As you do know, the CRM business is a bit of a lag for us. International business did quite well. U.S. lagged a little bit and the Modular ATP, proud of the team for that. That was a long study, a very difficult project. But you saw the results of that S-ICD with the modular platform and we're excited to launch that in 2025. So there are two other areas that I didn't mention before that you pointed out. And also, what's not being mentioned here today is just the tremendous growth in our Endo and Uro businesses. Our Uro business is near double digits for the first half. Our Endo business is near double digit for the first half. Those are all accretive margin companies for us. We're very excited about the Axonics acquisition, which will have operational benefit in 2025 and organic in 2026 primarily. But it just makes those divisions even stronger. So there's many things to be excited about for the future of the company to continue on with a goal of differentiated performance. Danielle Antalffy : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Scientific. Please go ahead. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Great, thanks so much. From Piper Sandler. Just maybe on just sticking with kind of where Danielle is going outside of PFA. Just on the WATCHMAN business, 20% growth is a little bit of a tick up versus Q1. Your competitor said they grew 45% in the quarter. So are you losing a little bit of share to those guys or is the market starting to accelerate for some reason, I don't know if it's in front of this concomitant reimbursement, just maybe talk a little bit about that? And then maybe for Dr. Stein specifically, if you get this concomitant reimbursement, can you just talk about the workflow for the clinician in terms of doing a PFA case plus a WATCHMAN case at the same time. I mean how much more challenging is that you have to bring in an ICE sometimes and other times not bringing ICE and to do the WATCHMAN part of the case, just maybe talk a little bit about that opportunity going forward? Thank you. Michael F. Mahoney: Yes, I'll just touch on the growth, 20% is excellent. We're in the midst of launching our WATCHMAN FLX Pro and maybe as importantly, this new steerable sheet, which is early in its launch. And so I think to clinical data and the extremely high market share of WATCHMAN speaks for itself and the ongoing R&D platforms that we're driving for WATCHMAN and clinical science. So we are extremely comfortable that we're nearly 90% of share in the U.S. and there may be some extremely price-sensitive accounts that will occasionally lose business to. But it's very, very small margin. Very, very small numbers. And if you look at the size of the WATCHMAN business and our share and our technology lead, we're very comfortable with the position we're in. Kenneth Stein : Yes. And then in terms of just workflow and concomitant, this is one of the areas where I think in between, right, the safety and efficiency advantages of WATCHMAN FLX and FLX Pro combined with the efficiency and safety advantages of FARAPULSE could create a real advantage for us as a unified ecosystem. The beauty of doing these two procedures together, right, is they both involve transseptal access into the left atrium. They both involve the catheter manipulation inside the left atrium. So there's a huge benefit to patients to be able to have it all done at one sitting as opposed to having to have one procedure and then go through many of the same risks of the first procedure go and have it done as a second procedure. And just to reiterate, when you think of doing it as a concomitant procedure what you want our technologies that enable you to do it safely and we do it reproducibly and enable you to do it efficiently. So you're spending as little time as possible, right, mucking about inside someone's left atrium. And FARAPULSE and WATCHMAN FLX Pro together are unmatched in giving you those advantages. Operator : And I understand there is time for one last question. Michael F. Mahoney: Yes, please. Operator : Okay. That last question will come from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Matthew Taylor : Hi, good morning guys, thank you for taking the questions. Congrats on a great quarter. I did want to ask a follow-up question on FARAPULSE just to help with thinking about the modeling and the opportunity there. Could you give us any kind of update or parameters on how many centers you're in, how many boxes you've placed, and maybe talk about whether the early experience has changed your views on how the market could evolve like you laid out at the Analyst Day several months ago? Michael F. Mahoney: Yes, I think the only piece of that we'll provide color on is the last part of it. We don't want to break out catheter usage, capital usage, how many sites. I would say the utilization rates of sites once they use FARAPULSE is very quick and sustainable. So we're not seeing hospitals turn it on and turn it off and go in and out of it, like you see in many med tech products. So the sustainability and usage of FARAPULSE is very high once customers start using it. And obviously, we have a chance to sell more consoles to larger centers in the existing accounts besides opening new accounts. And the second part was what -- having a senior moment. [Multiple Speakers] Great, thanks. I ended it with a dud, sorry Matt. Matthew O\u2019Brien: That\u2019s okay, alright. Jon Monson : Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific. If we were unable to get to your question or have any follow-ups, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team. And before you disconnect, Drew will give you all the pertinent details for the replay. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Boston Scientific Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jon Monson, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jonathan Monson : Thanks, Drew, and thanks everyone for joining us. With me today are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ken Stein and Art Butcher, President of our MedSurg and Asia Pacific businesses. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q3 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in this release. The release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. Please note, on the call, operational revenue excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and organic revenue further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales. Guidance excludes the previously-announced agreement to acquire Axonics, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. For more information, please refer to the Q3 financial and operational highlights deck, which may be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. On this call, all references to sales and revenue are organic, and relative growth is compared to the same quarter of the prior year, unless otherwise specified. This call contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, our financial performance, business plans and product performance and development. These statements are based on our current beliefs using information available to us as of today's date and are not intended to be guarantees of future events or performance. If our underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect or certain risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary from those projected by the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences are discussed in our periodic reports and other filings with the SEC, including the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. Boston Scientific disclaims any intention or obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike. Mike? Michael Mahoney : Thanks, John. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Our Q3 results exceeded our expectations and we continue to invest in our portfolio and capabilities to deliver differentiated performance over the long-term. In Q3 '24, total company operational sales grew 19% and organic sales grew 18%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of 13% to 15%. Our excellent growth is and will continue to be focused on our category leadership strategy, fueled by innovation, clinical evidence generation and the winning spirit of our global team. Q3 adjusted EPS of $0.63 grew 27%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.57 to $0.59. In Q3, adjusted operating margin was 27.2%. Turning to our fourth quarter and the full year '24 outlook. We're guiding to organic growth of 14% to 16% for fourth quarter and raising our full year guidance to approximately 15%, reflecting momentum across our broad portfolio and particularly in AF solutions. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS guidance is now $0.64 to $0.66 and we expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $2.45 to $2.47 representing growth of 20% to 21%. Dan will provide more details on our financials in a few minutes and I'll provide additional highlights on our third quarter results, along with our comments and our outlook. Regionally, on an operational basis, the US grew 24% with double-digit growth or higher in six of eight business units. Our EP business continues to deliver impressive performance fueled by FARAPULSE, new account openings and very strong reorder rates. Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 14% on an operational basis. This performance was driven by continued above-market performance in EP, where we continue to expand our PFA leadership, complex PCI and structural heart. In TAVI, we received CE Mark and recently launched our next-generation ACURATE Prime Valve. I also want to announce that following a nearly 30-year career at Boston Scientific, our President of EMEA, Eric Thepaut , will retire in December and Xavier Bertrand, currently the Vice President of Peripheral Interventions in EMEA will be appointed the new President of EMEA. I want to thank Eric for his many significant contributions to the organization and congratulate Xavier on his new role. Asia Pac grew 12% operationally with excellent performance in China, Australia, New Zealand and grew mid-teens despite recent VBP implementations. In Japan, we received PMDA approval of the FARAPULSE PFA system and anticipate reimbursement and commercial launch in the coming weeks. I'll now provide some additional commentary on our business units. Urology sales grew 10% with double-digit growth in Stone Management and Prostate Health, including double-digit growth in both Rezum and SpaceOAR. Within the quarter, we continue to see momentum from the launches of LithoVue Elite and the Tenacio Pump with our AMS 700 device. And looking forward, we expect to close the previously announced acquisition of Axonics in the fourth quarter and we're excited to add this excellent business into Boston Scientific in our Urology business. Endoscopy sales grew 7% organically and 8% operationally with strong growth, particularly in the US. Our anchor products continue to drive above-market growth with AXIOS and Exalt D, both growing double-digits in the quarter. We also continue to see strong double-digit growth in our Endoluminal Surgery franchise. We're pleased to recently received a Category 1 CPT code for the ESG weight loss procedure, which is expected to further momentum within this business. Neuromodulation sales grew 3% organically and 17% operationally including Relievant, which will turn organic in November. Our brains franchise returned to low double-digit growth in the quarter in the US, supported by de novo implants and competitive replacements. Our pain franchise grew low-single-digits organically and double-digits operationally. Our global SCS performance was below our expectations in a market that continues to be challenged, offset by growth in the rest of the pain portfolio, which reflects the value of our category leadership strategy. Peripheral Intervention sales grew 10% organically and 12% operationally. Within our Vascular business, we saw mid-single-digit growth in arterial with continued double-digit growth in Drug-Eluting therapies and low double-digit growth in Venous. We're also pleased to have closed our acquisition of Silk Road Medical in mid-September, adding the innovative TCAR system to our vascular portfolio. Our interventional oncology and embolization franchise grew double-digits again driven by continued momentum from recent launches in embolization and sustained double-digit growth in TheraSphere. Cardiology delivered another exceptional quarter with sales growing 29%. Within Cardiology, Interventional Cardiology Therapies grew 14%. Mid-teens growth in Coronary Therapies was supported by the launch of the US AGENT performance, continued global adoption of coronary imaging with our AVVIGO+ platform and our Calcium portfolio. The US AGENT launch continues to exceed our expectations with both new account openings and strong reorder rates. We also recently commenced enrollment in the aging IDE long lesion substudy and completed enrollment in our Vitalist early feasibility study in high-risk PCI patients. Congratulations to the team on that milestone. Our structural heart valves franchise grew double-digits in the third quarter led by another quarter of above-market growth of ACURATE Neo2 in Europe. In the US, we continue to collaborate with the FDA and our regulatory strategy and data from the US ACURATE IDE will be presented at TCT on October 30. WATCHMAN grew 18% with continued conversion to WATCHMAN FLX Pro in the US and Japan. And globally, we surpassed 500,000 patients treated with the WATCHMAN device, driven by our innovation, clinical evidence and patient awareness efforts. Key near-term catalyst for WATCHMAN drive our confidence in delivering high growth in this business, including the recently implemented DRG for concomitant LAAC and AF ablation. And if positive, the data readout from the OPTION trial, which will be presented as a late-breaking clinical trial at the American Heart Association Conference on November 16th. We also recently commenced enrollment of our SIMPLIFY trial, which studying the less intensive post-procedure drug regimen, enabled by our latest generation WATCHMAN FLX Pro and continue to expect data from the CHAMPION trial in the first half of '26. Cardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 2% in the quarter. In the third quarter, our Diagnostics franchise grew high-single-digits, driven by our implantable cardiac monitors, LUX-Dx, which both received CE Mark within the quarter. In Core CRM, strong international growth was offset by below market growth in the US. We're excited about new and upcoming product launches in this business, including the expanded indication of our INGEVITY lead for conduction system pacing, which received FDA approval in the quarter and our EMPOWUR leadless pacemaker, which we now have submitted to the FDA. Electrophysiology sales grew an exceptional 177% in the quarter, driven by continued commercial execution, pull-through in our Access Solutions business and increased procedure volumes driven by excellent outcomes as well as efficiencies gained with FARAPULSE. We have now treated over 125,000 patients with FARAPULSE, driving rapid and transformative conversion from RF and cryo to PFA, specifically using FARAPULSE. As a result of this accelerated conversion in the market, we now expect PFA to likely exceed our previously communicated range of 40% to 60% of global AF ablations by 2026. We are excited about the recent FARAPULSE approvals in both Japan and China and expect these launches to have a meaningful impact on our global EP business in 2025. Recently, we received USA approval of the FARAWAVE NAV Catheter, which combined with a FARAVIEW Software to visualize cardiac ablation procedures exclusively with our OPAL HDx mapping system. We are pleased to have completed the follow-up Phase I of the ADVANTAGE AF clinical trial, which is evaluating FARAPULSE in the treatment of patients with drug-refractory persistent AF. And we expect to submit the results of the trial to the FDA later this quarter and anticipating presenting the results in early '25 with label expansion expected in the second half of '25. We're also studying in a very new patient population of drug-naive persistent AF patients in AVANT GUARD. As we have neared the end of this enrollment, we have elected to temporarily pause the trial to assess a few unanticipated observations. It is our intention to resume enrollments in the near-term. And based on the totality of clinical evidence and commercial real-world experience, we remain extremely confident in the unique performance of FARAPULSE. In closing, we're very proud of the performance of our global teams and are confident in the sustainability of our top-tier financial performance. With that, I'll hand over to Dan and provide more details on the financials. Daniel Brennan : Thanks, Mike. Third quarter 2024 consolidated revenue of $4,209 million represents 19.4% reported growth versus third quarter of 2023 and includes a 10 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, which was favorable versus our expectations. Excluding this $4 million foreign exchange headwind, operational revenue growth was 19.5% in the quarter. Sales impact from closed acquisitions contributed 130 basis points, resulting in 18.2% organic revenue growth, exceeding our third quarter guidance range of 13% to 15%. Q3 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $0.63 grew 27% versus 2023, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.57 to $0.59 primarily driven by our strong sales performance. Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 70.4%, slightly lower than anticipated, driven primarily by foreign exchange. We continue to expect second half adjusted gross margin to be higher than the first half and full year adjusted gross margin to be slightly below our 2023 rate. Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 27.2%, which expanded 110 basis points versus the prior year period. Given our strong year-to-date performance, we now expect full year adjusted operating margin to be approximately 27%. We believe this strikes a nice balance of delivering incremental margin from our sales upside and continuing to invest appropriately to drive strong top line performance. On a GAAP basis, third quarter operating margin was 17.4%. Moving to below the line. Third quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $65 million, which was favorable to our expectations primarily due to higher interest income. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the third quarter was 13.2%, which includes favorable discrete tax items. Our operational tax rate for the quarter was 13.5%. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1,487 million in the third quarter. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $822 million, with $1,002 million from operating activities less $180 million in net capital expenditures, which includes payments of $208 million related to acquisitions, restructuring, litigation and other special items. In 2024, we continue to expect full year free cash flow to exceed $2 billion, which includes approximately $900 million of expected payments related to special items. As of September 30th, 2024, we had cash on hand of $2.5 billion, and our gross debt leverage ratio was 2.4 times. Our top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A followed by annual share repurchases to offset dilution from employee stock grants. Our legal reserve was $250 million as of September 30th, roughly flat versus Q2 2024. $53 million of this reserve is already funded through our qualified settlement funds. I'll now walk through guidance for Q4 and full year 2024. We expect full year 2024 reported revenue growth to be approximately 16.5% versus 2023. Excluding an approximate 50 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, based on current rates. We expect full year 2024 operational revenue growth to be approximately 17%. Excluding a 200 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full year 2024 organic revenue growth to be approximately 15% versus 2023. We expect fourth quarter 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 16.5% to 18.5% versus fourth quarter 2023. Excluding an approximate 50 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange, based on current rates, we expect fourth quarter 2024 operational revenue growth to be 16% to 18% and excluding a 200 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect fourth quarter 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 14% to 16% versus 2023. We continue to expect full year 2024 adjusted below-the-line expenses to be approximately $300 million. We also continue to expect a full year 2024 operational tax rate of approximately 13.5% and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 12.5%, which contemplates current legislation, including enacted laws and issued guidance under OECD Pillar 2 rules. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.47 representing growth of 20% to 21% versus 2023, including an approximate $0.04 headwind from foreign exchange, which is unchanged from our previous expectations. We expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.64 to $0.66. Before we move to Q&A, I want to provide a few housekeeping items related to 2025 that may be helpful with your modeling. There will be one less business day in 2025, which comes in Q1. Note that in 2024, we have two extra business days versus 2023, one here in Q3 and one upcoming in Q4. Below the line, we expect a meaningful increase versus 2024 related to higher adjusted net interest expense. In 2024, we will earn approximately $100 million of nonrecurring interest income on the cash raised earlier this year to fund the Axonics acquisition, which we expect to close here in the fourth quarter. In 2025, we also have approximately $1.6 billion of bonds coming due, which we expect to look to refinance likely at higher rates than the existing bonds while maintaining our strong balance sheet. The good news is, this incremental expense should largely be offset by the operating income dollars associated with the deals we have closed in 2024 and the expected close of Axonics. Based on current global tax legislation, we expect our tax rate to be in line with our historical rate of approximately 14% operational and 13% adjusted. In 2025, we will aim to outperform our markets, deliver meaningful margin improvement and grow adjusted earnings per share double-digits and faster than sales towards our goal of being the highest performing large-cap medtech company as we said at last year's Investor Day. For more information, check our Investor Relations website for Q3 2024 financial and operational highlights which outlines more details on Q3 results and 2024 guidance. And with that, I'll turn it back to Jon, who'll moderate the Q&A. Jonathan Monson : Thanks, Dan. Drew, let's open it up for questions for the next 40 minutes or so. In order for us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Drew, please go ahead. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Robert Marcus : Great. Good morning and congrats on another fantastic quarter here. Michael Mahoney : Thanks, Robbie. Robert Marcus : My one question, there's so much to ask about here. Michael Mahoney : Make it a good one, Robbie. Robert Marcus : In our checks, we hear consistently that the upcoming OPTION trial that we'll see at AHA, combined with the recently started on October 1st reimbursement for concomitant, WATCHMAN and PF ablation has already started to kick in the gear and OPTION could meaningfully alter the usage patterns ahead of CHAMPION in the first half of '26. So I wanted to get your thoughts on the importance of both concomitant and should OPTION be positive what that can mean for both of those franchises, both in the short and long-term? Thanks. Michael Mahoney : Sure. I'll comment and Dr. Stein can add probably more helpful color. Clearly, independently, both platforms are doing incredibly well. WATCHMAN on its own with all the clinical evidence, and you saw the amazing results of FARAPULSE today. And doctors are so comfortable with both procedures. It's a very safe procedure. The concomitant reimbursement, we view as quite positive. It's also very positive economic for the hospital, benefits for the patient, the procedure will be performed safety. So we're really pleased with that concomitant. And so it's clearly an ongoing long-term tailwind for WATCHMAN and also further helps FARAPULSE. Both platforms, as you know, have a number of different clinical trials to continue to expand indications. And Dr. Stein, any other comments you'd like to make on it? Kenneth Stein : No. Sure, Mike. Thanks, Robbie. I again reiterate what Mike said at the outset, right? I mean, the ability to do concomitant procedures and get reimbursed with them under the new CMS DRG, it's one of those things that it's positive for patients, it's positive for the health care system and hospitals and it's certainly positive for us given the unique advantages in doing concomitant procedures when you think of the safety and efficiency of FARAPULSE, and you think of the safety and efficiency and frankly excellent outcomes with FARAPULSE and with WATCHMAN FLX and WATCHMAN FLX Pro. Again, just to give some sense of the importance of this, right, there are approximately 350,000 ablations performed in the US every year for atrial fibrillation. And roughly half of those patients are at high risk of stroke according to things like the CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system. I think we are all anxiously looking forward to see the OPTION data when it gets read out and the impact that will have, I think stating the obvious will depend on what those data show. And if they do show a compelling benefit to WATCHMAN, right, how big is that benefit? And then, again, to reiterate what Mike said, beyond OPTION, we also have the CHAMPION trial. Expecting that trial to read out in early '26, which would look at WATCHMAN versus the new oral anticoagulants in all comers. Robert Marcus : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning and thank you for the question. I want to talk about the amazing results of FARAPULSE that we just saw. And specifically how you're thinking about moving. I was really interested in one quote that you said to exceed 40% to 60% of global AF procedures by 2026. Thank you. Michael Mahoney : Sure. So this has just been a tremendous launch. Just a quick shout out to our operations supply chain team for staying ahead of the manufacturing. Extremely high demand for this product and the excellence that we're seeing in the field by the commercial and clinical teams. So doctors are moving surprisingly quickly towards FARAPULSE, surprisingly to what we thought it would be a year ago. So when we had the Investor Day, we weren't quite sure because we had didn't have approval in the US. We saw excellent momentum in Europe. And now our operations team is scaled to meet the demand. And those same excellent clinical outcomes and procedural efficiencies and safety benefits that patients received in Europe are being felt throughout the world now. We've been planning over 120,000 of them. So that was our point estimate about a year ago or so. And based on the rapid uptake, we're confident in stating that we do expect it to be at the high end and likely exceed that 40% to 60% based on how quickly physicians are transforming, especially for PVI from traditional RF and cryo to FARAPULSE. And it's also been supported by the studies within ADVENT that show the benefits of FARAPULSE versus traditional RF. So it's a great time in the market for the physicians and the patients. And we've also proven based on our competitive launches in Europe who have been out for a while that we clearly are the market leader in PFA and we have lots of plans in place to continue to extend that leadership with clinical differentiation and product enhancements. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Lawrence Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'll echo my congratulations on a really phenomenal quarter here. Dr. Stein, given the importance of FARAPULSE, can you provide more color on the AVANT GUARD trial and the observations you saw? And related to that, there are going to be more PFA ablation choices soon, including from the market leader. Once these new PFA catheters are launched, what are the factors that will lead existing FARAPULSE customers to stay with FARAPULSE or choose FARAPULSE if they haven't adopted it yet? Thank you. Kenneth Stein : Yes. Sure, Larry. Let me take those successively. So first, on AVANT GUARD. Again, as Mike said, due to a few unanticipated observations in the trial which is studying a completely new population, which is drug-naive patients with persistent AF, which FARAPULSE is not currently indicated to treat. We did elect to temporarily pause enrollment until we develop better understanding of the observations. While none of the observations were life-threatening, we did make a decision to temporarily pause, but it is our intention to resume enrollments in the near-term. And this in no way at all affects our confidence in the overall performance of the FARAPULSE system as it's being used today commercially or in other clinical trials. Again, as Mike said in his opening comments, we remain confident that we're going to obtain expanded indication for drug-refractory persistent AF patients. And that's the data from our ADVANTAGE Phase I trial. Again, as Mike said, we expect to submit that data to the FDA later this quarter. We expect to present that data in early 2025, with indication expansion expected to come in the second half of 2025. And again, I just want to close by emphasizing that this patient population that we're studying in AVANT GUARD, which is drug-naive persistent AF patients has not previously been studied, it's a population that's not indicated for ablation today under guidelines, and it's not the population that's being treated today with FARAPULSE system. And I also want to emphasize that we remain highly confident in the global performance of FARAPULSE, which has now been used to treat more than 125,000 patients across more than 65 different countries and is supported by extensive clinical data demonstrating positive outcomes for the device. And I think that also leads into your second question, right, which is why is FARAPULSE going to maintain category leadership in Pulsed Field Ablation and what's going to prompt new users to continue to newly adopt the system. And it's several things. I think, first of all, it's just the compelling ease of use and straightforward nature of doing the ablation with FARAPULSE. It's just a tremendous clinical experience that people have when they start using the system. I am not aware of anyone who started using this and then has stopped and gone back to thermal ablation. It's also an extensive clinical trial data that we've got supporting it. As Mike mentioned, right, we had a sub-analysis, the ADVENT data, which is the first data that anyone has had to actually show superiority and efficacy outcomes when we look at AF burden as a secondary analysis of the ADVENT data. It's supported by published clinical data now in approximately 20,000 patients globally. And again, as Mike said, right, in Europe, where we've seen commercial systems launch, right, we really have not seen that meaningfully detract from the position that FARAPULSE has as the leading PFA system in those markets. And then last, just to make sure it doesn't get lost in all the other stuff here, right, the approval and the launch now of FARAWAVE NAV Catheter and FARAVIEW mapping system, which really becomes the first mapping system that's really designed around PFA, I think, provides just maybe it's the cherry on top of that sundae in terms of answering your question. Lawrence Biegelsen : Thank you so much. Operator : The next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead. Frederick Wise : Thank you, and good morning, everybody. I'm hoping, Mike, that you or Dr. Stein will expand on the NAV Cat comments from a couple of aspects. Just are you ready to fully launch and train? Will NAV Cat have a price premium, given premier technology first to market with something like this integrated. Can we assume that you're going to sell it at a higher price? And just last and sort of related to what Dr. Stein was talking about as well. If FARAWAVE is approved for, only AFib, obviously a huge portion of the market, how does it, how are you going to manage the argument that other imaging mapping systems, obviously are approved for all imaging? Just where will FARA NAV fit in, in the broader, the larger scheme? Thank you. Michael Mahoney : Dr. Stein? Kenneth Stein : Yes, Rick. Let me take the second part of that question first and then get on to what some of the advantages are that we see unique to FARAVIEW right, which is on our refreshed OPAL HDx platform. And so again, right, the OPAL platform is approved for mapping navigation across the whole spectrum of cardiac arrhythmias. Now when we look at the use specifically as it integrates with FARAWAVE and FARAWAVE NAV like FARAWAVE is an AF ablation catheter. And I think part of the reason that we've seen the success that we've had, part of the reason I was able to give the answer that I did to Larry, right, is that it's just exquisitely beautifully designed for ablating atrial fibrillation. It's a fantastic tool for pulmonary vein isolation. And again, we hope to share our data from our ADVANTAGE clinical trial showing how it is also can be used to treat persistent atrial fibrillation. But it is really explicitly not designed to be the catheter to tackle some other arrhythmias. The next catheter in our pipeline is our FARAPOINT Catheter. And that catheter was studied in Phase II of our ADVANTAGE clinical trial. And we have completed enrollment in that Phase II of ADVANTAGE and are continuing to follow those patients. And to start, we'd expect to qualify that catheter for use for treating arrhythmia called atrial flutter as an adjunct to atrial fibrillation ablation procedures. But beyond that, right, it could see FARAPOINT used, right, for really any sort of arrhythmia where you would prefer a point catheter form factor. And then next to follow after that, right, is our so-called map and ablate catheter. It's a large focal lesion catheter called FARAFLEX, right, which, again, all of these will integrate with FARAWAVE on OPAL, right? And that would really give us building the capability to be able to target the vast majority of arrhythmias that are seen in clinical practice. In terms of FARAVIEW specifically, again, I think it's really important to emphasize. This is the first mapping and navigation software that's built around understanding Pulsed Field Ablation. And so it gives a lot of advantages to users to want to use it to navigate a catheter. It gives dynamic visualization of the FARAWAVE catheter as it moves into its various configurations, whether it's a basket or a flower or anything in between. And it's also got a unique feature of called field tagging, where physicians will be able to see where the pulsed field will intersect with tissue and hopefully allow them to better strategize where and when and how to put lesions in when they're doing an ablation procedure. Frederick Wise : That's an amazing answer. And just the price premium part? Thank you. Kenneth Stein : Yes, I'm not going to comment on pricing on specific products, Rick? Frederick Wise : Thanks so much, everybody. Operator : The next question comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. David Roman : Thank you and good morning everyone. I was hoping to switch gears a little bit from the EP side of the business. And maybe if you could spend a few minutes on the performance of the franchises kind of ex-WATCHMAN and EP, which are still trending very well, although a slowdown from where you started the year. How are you thinking about resource allocation and just the focus on those businesses and maintaining ongoing support for those franchises in light of the success of PFA? And how should we think about the growth drivers in some of those more established categories on a go-forward basis? Michael Mahoney : Sure. I'll take that. I'll give Dr. Stein some oxygen here. We run as a very decentralized business units. And so we have -- the leaders of these divisions that's all they do. They have global teams, thousands of employees. They wake up and think about peripheral inventions, interventional oncology, endoscopy, urology, neuromod all day long and ICTx, which grew at what 15% in the quarter. So there's tremendous focus by their teams on the global execution of these businesses. We just announced the closing of Silk Road. We anticipate announcing the closing of Axonics in the fourth quarter here. Just as Ken said, we attempt to drive this category leadership in terms of our breadth of portfolio and unique innovation across each division. And we have different varying degrees of success in that. But in general, we're very strong in that area. So in terms of capital allocation, we've obviously invested significantly in the manufacturing ramp of PFA as well as ongoing R&D and clinical studies as well as commercial capabilities to continue to enhance our mapping sales force. But that in no way has detracted from the investments that we're making across these other businesses, which are really the foundation of the company. And despite doing both those at the same times, we continue to improve our margin profile, which I think shows the testament and the winning spirit of the team. So we have a rich pipeline of products organically within these business units. You've seen the performance for the quarter and the full year. We did see a bit of a slowdown in some procedure volume in the summertime in July, August, specifically in our endo, uro business. But we saw a nice procedure bounce back in September and essentially grew kind of in line where we have for the past eight quarters in those businesses. So we have a lot of confidence in them and we don't, Dr. Stein and I may spend a bit more time on PFA, certainly Dr. Stein does. But we don't take the gas pedal down on the other businesses at all in the company. David Roman : Great. Thanks. I appreciate the perspective. Operator : The next question comes from Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Patrick Wood : Perfect. Thank you very much for taking my question. I guess just one on capacity in totality for the system. Obviously, I get PFA adding some efficiencies to the system overall. But for EPs, between WATCHMAN and everything, there's a tremendous call on people's time. We saw in structural heart a little bit of noise on one of the players saying there were capacity constraints. How are you viewing that going forward? And how quickly do you think the system can adapt to enable you to keep growing these franchise and still have capacity to actually get them done? Thanks. Michael Mahoney : Well, we're still relatively early in our launch. In the US, we got approved in February. We started launching in late February and March. So that we still have a number of new accounts that have not used FARAPULSE in the US. And we have yet to launch in Japan and we've yet to launch in a meaningful way in China in many other countries. So we're still quite early in the launch in very major markets. And we're seeing, in currently launched accounts, we're seeing many accounts move from one system originally to two, three and sometimes four systems. So they're increasing their utilization of FARAPULSE across their multiple labs. So we have a lot to do to continue to increase share within existing accounts. And then thirdly, because of the efficiencies of the system, the hospitals are improving their workflow, and most accounts are doing, I don't know, Ken, 25%, 30% more procedure volume in a day. So there's a lot of efficiencies and the hospitals win economically and the patients benefit as do the physicians. And then to your term on capacity, that's why this concomitant procedure is also a big win for the workflow of the hospital and the patient. So now an extra 10, 15 minutes for the appropriate patient, you can do a FARAPULSE system as well as the LAAC with WATCHMAN. So it also drives procedural efficiency, which is very unique to Boston Scientific versus our competitors. So when we design these platforms, we look at operational efficiency and also the economics of the hospital. And we think FARAPULSE and WATCHMAN and concomitant are all very helpful to hospitals efficiency. And we're still really early in the launch of FARAPULSE. Patrick Wood : Love it. Thanks for the color. Operator : The next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Travis Steed : Hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on the AVANT GUARD trial pausing. I guess a lot of questions on that this morning. So it seems like the observations you saw didn't change your thoughts drastically if you're restarting the trial soon. And then just making sure that maybe help us understand why this doesn't really change your view on safety of FARAPULSE overall or mitigate the real-world data you have or and maybe just help us understand this patient population that's in this trial today, how they're getting treated today would be great? Thanks a lot. Kenneth Stein : Yes. Sure, Travis. Let me again begin, at least the patient population. And so right today standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed persistent atrial fibrillation is to get a trial of antiarrhythmic drug therapy first. And then guidelines would say only to be referred for ablation if they actually fail antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Obviously because even though we've paused enrollment for the moment, there's still an ongoing clinical trial. So I really can't get into any detail on the observations. Again, just to reassure everyone, nothing that we saw certainly was life-threatening. And I think we are very highly confident in the overall safety profile, overall efficacy and again overall efficiency of FARAPULSE system. And again that's just based on the extensive experience that we've got with it, which is both commercial experience, as we said, over 125,000 patients now have been treated with this system globally as well as extensive clinical data that's been published in approximately 20,000 patients and data that we see from all of our ongoing clinical trials. Travis Steed : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Please go ahead. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on this amazing quarter. I'm kind of speechless. But just wanted to ask, I appreciate there's not going to be a lot you can say, Dan, I appreciate the comments that you did give on 2025. But specifically, as we think about sales, you noted above-market sales growth. I mean market can be a moving target a little bit here about how you think about the market's growing next year. So I was hoping maybe you could give a little bit more color, if possible, even if it's just highlighting tailwinds and headwinds from a sales growth perspective to think about as we look ahead to 2025. Thanks so much. Michael Mahoney : I'll start and then Dan, you can clean up my mess. So we're excited, obviously, about '24 growing estimated 15% over a comp of 12% of 2023. And as we head into 2025, obviously, we'll have a nice comp at approximately 15%. But there's so many good things going on with the company. Thank you for the non-FARAPULSE question that was asked earlier about the other businesses like PI and ICTx and neurology commonly growing double-digits and the strength of endo and we want to strengthen neuromod and US CRM a bit more. And so but as we look at 2025, the big headlines obviously are FARAPULSE and WATCHMAN. We do think the Japan launch and China launch will drive meaningful growth for the franchise. And as I mentioned just prior, there's a number of new accounts to open in the US and there's a lot of penetration in current accounts to add additional volume to both FARAPULSE. You've heard all about the concomitant reimburse for WATCHMAN. So those are all nice tailwinds for the company. The procedure volumes we see is relatively consistent. We did see a bit of a slowdown in July, August, but strengthening in September. And so we think procedure volumes will maintain strong versus as they are now. And we see strong global performance. So obviously, we'll have some more challenging comps. There will be some more competition in PFA, but we're doing very well, I guess, that competition in Europe. I don't know, Dan, also we have the AGENT, which throw one out to the cardiology team, which has performed quite well. So we'll find out about reimbursement on that product in the next coming weeks. That should add some additional momentum to that franchise. Daniel Brennan : I think that summarizes it well. And just to give you a sense of the process, it's no different than it is any year. We have our annual operating plan process that's alive and well here through the fourth quarter. We'll review that as we go through the end of the quarter and into early next year and we'll let you know what we think for 2025 at our Q4 earnings call. Danielle Antalffy : Appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question comes from Anthony Petrone with Mizuho Group. Please go ahead. Anthony Petrone : Thanks and congrats on a strong quarter here. I think the question will be on the go-to-market next year, 2025, you go back to the October 18 press release and you have FARAWAVE NAV Catheter out there, but it indicates that it's exclusive to OPAL on the mapping side. So in other words, the company is coming with a closed loop offering here next year. And presumably, we'll have competitors that are coming with a bundled approach. So maybe the question here is just when we enter '25, it seems that three competitors will be out there with a bundled approach to PFA with mappers. So maybe just walk through that dynamic a little bit. Congratulations again on the quarter. Michael Mahoney : Yes. I'll just comment and Ken, again, you can finish this. So today customers using FARAPULSE with our legacy RHYTHMIA mapping system and they're also using it with our two primary competitors today. So the OPAL platform will not be closed out in such a way that if a physician wants to continue to use a competitive mapping system with FARAPULSE, they still can. We do think that with the OPAL mapping system, specifically with FARAPULSE, the user experience will be more meaningful and more streamlined and differentiated. So we're not closing the system and that we're shutting out competitive systems from doing FARAPULSE cases. But we're quite confident in the user experience, the overall economics and the value of the OPAL integration with FARAPULSE to be differentiated versus what they're using today. Kenneth Stein : Yes. I mean, Anthony, just to again build on what Mike said, right, we do not feel that we've got to force people to use our products. And what we see with FARAWAVE is people want to use it. And people have used it in a variety of different ways and we are going to continue to support their ability to use it in the way that they want to. And that includes people who use no mapping navigation at all, which is really through the predominant use case that we see in Europe and throughout a lot of the world or use it with a mapping and navigation system. We're going to continue to keep the original , right, the FARAWAVE Catheter without the NAV sensor on the market for people who want to use it with a competitive mapping system. FARAWAVE NAV, because it's got a magnetic NAV sensor and it does have to get tied into a particular mapping system, which for us is the refreshed OPAL HDx system with FARAVIEW. But we're not going to force people to use it. we think it's got enough compelling differentiated advantages compared to what else is out there that people are going to want to use it. Anthony Petrone : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hi, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter here and thanks for taking my question. Mike, maybe one for you on next week's ACURATE Neo2 results here. What is the regulatory strategy? Do you expect to file with the FDA? And I think you mentioned that you expect to have a successful launch in the US. Is that referring to Neo2 or some other generation of the valves? So maybe talk about your TAVR strategy in the US? Michael Mahoney : Sure. So as we've talked about before, the ACURATE Neo2 trial on the 1,500 patient will be TCT on what Wednesday? Daniel Brennan : October 30th. Michael Mahoney : October 30th. So that is an important milestone to see that clinical trial datas that will be presented. And we'll actually be holding an investor meeting that day with Joe Fitzgerald and Lance Bates and the team to talk about the broader cardiology portfolio and the plan for ACCURATE post the data. As you know, we've continued to have excellent momentum in Europe. You saw the third quarter results. We continue to grow above-market. And kudos to the team on the launch of Prime, the next-generation ACURATE Neo2, which they just recently started implementing in Europe. Vijay Kumar : Sorry and does it mean you expect to file with the FDA, Mike? And what does successful launch mean? Michael Mahoney : Well, a successful launch, we've never provided share, attainment goals just like we don't provide a share for FARAPULSE. So we obviously want to grow the business. It's a very large market, very mature, market growing, I don't know, 8% -- 7%, 9% and we continue to do quite well in the US, but we'll provide more information at the TCT at the investor call there. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Please go ahead. Matt Miksic : Hey, thanks so much for fitting us in and congrats on a really impressive quarter and all the great growth drivers you have running. I had a question just on maybe for Dan on some of the dynamics in the gross margin line in the quarter you mentioned FX being kind of one of the primary headwinds. But as you move into '25, maybe you can talk a little bit about where the leverage in the model is, if it's stable gross margin and levering some of the operating investments that you're making? Maybe just some color on how that -- how you see that progressing at this point? Thanks. Daniel Brennan : Sure, Matt. The Q3 story is actually pretty simple. So we were 70.4% gross margin in Q3, slightly below what we would have expected and that's really driven by foreign exchange in the quarter. So simple story for Q3. We've said consistently that we believe our full year adjusted gross margin will be below last year. Last year, we were 70.7%. So we've consistently said, you know what, we're probably not going to hit that 70.7% in 2024, that's okay because we're actually driving 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion without that kind of testament to the hallmark of the DNA of the company of continuing to drive margin expansion through all lines of the P&L. So 2024 gross margin, not going to contribute, that's okay because we have the SG&A and other horses to ride there. As you go into '25 and beyond, I think all lines of the P&L could contribute. I think gross margin is part of that. And how does that happen? A big piece of that will be product mix. So call FARAPULSE today, the single-use catheter, that's a nice margin, but you have a lot of that, the capital placements that we have. As Mike mentioned, we're still launching this. It's only six or seven months into the launch. So we're still launching a lot of capital, placing a lot of capital. And next year, we'll have Japan and China. So we'll still be doing that. We'll be effectively launching there. But I think the story is as you go into '25 and work through '25 and beyond, FARAPULSE becomes accretive overall as the single-use catheter kind of swamps the overall margin within FARAPULSE and is accretive to overall Boston Scientific. WATCHMAN is obviously helpful. You heard a lot of commentary on the call today about the some of the tailwinds that could be there for WATCHMAN. That's great news for the gross margin line. So I think the takeaway is gross margin, '25 and beyond, gross margin can be a contributor to the overall operating margin journey that's been so successful for the company for the last decade. Matt Miksic : That's great. Thanks a lot. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Joshua Jennings : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on another home run quarter. I wanted to just check the box, Mike, you called out or you called out your ops and supply chain team for keeping up with the demand for FARAPULSE and staying on time. I just want to make sure that there's no manufacturing capacity issues next year if that franchise continues to outperform internal expectations? And then also just sorry to follow up on a two-parter. But wanted to just get your team's view on this mapping segment. I mean our understanding is that mapping capital and diagnostic mapping catheters, the kind of the percentage of the overall ablation market, it's even higher than the ablation catheter segment and just I know you guys are now well positioned there, but just to review that and maybe just the revenue -- the business model for Boston Scientific, whether there's FARAPULSE NAV Catheter will be single-use for PVIs and or and then just how you're building out your diagnostic mapping catheter portfolio. Sorry for the multipart. Kenneth Stein : Hey, Josh, I'll take the second part first and then we can get to the supply issue. So just for clarity. Michael Mahoney : Let me just jump up. There is no supply issue. So let's talk about that. So kudos to the team. Let me take the first part. We do not anticipate, even despite the high demand, our team has done a great job on the catheter supply and the console supply. So we don't anticipate any supply shortages. Kenneth Stein : Thanks. I should not have used that word. Yes, in terms of just for clarity. So the FARAWAVE NAV Catheter, it is a single-use device. It is, again, current indicated for PVI for patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. As we said at the ADVANTAGE clinical trial is our clinical trial to get label expansion for the FARAWAVE Catheter family for use in patients with drug refractory persistent atrial fibrillation. And again I think what we really want to emphasize here is that there's some really significant differentiated advantages to FARAVIEW versus other systems that are currently on the market for mapping a navigation of PFA catheters, right? And that's specifically ability to dynamic visualization of the catheter shape as it changes ability also to do field tagging and so ability to plan where to put lesions in when you're doing an ablation procedure. Joshua Jennings : And just in terms of the diagnostic mapping catheter portfolio buildout, you guys do have a high-density mapping catheter in the pipeline is my understanding, but just wanted to get a better look on that. Kenneth Stein : Yes. I mean, Josh, we already have a high-density mapping catheter, right, which is our ORION catheter, which can be used on the refreshed OPAL system. And then as we go down the road, right, we've talked about additional catheters and be part of the FARAPULSE family, which includes FARAPOINT and includes our FARAFLEX catheter, which would have the capability to do both high-density mapping and also do PFA ablation in the same catheter. Michael Mahoney : They're all -- just I'll just add on and we'll move on to the next one. There are elements of the procedure that we don't compete in today that pie like ice catheters and others. So we're doing extremely well in the ablation portion of it. We expect OPAL to do quite well in the mapping segment, which we've been underscaled in, but there are still segments within the EP procedure mix that we don't play in today that we're shooting to fill out in the portfolio over time. I'll just make one other comment on FARAPULSE relates to China for -- it wasn't a question, but we're excited about the approval in Japan and in China. We do expect the China launch to be a bit slower than what you typically see in the US and Japan based on obviously, not product or team, but it's more on getting approvals and registries and launch cadence in terms of the volume of new accounts. We've done some recent openings there that have gone quite well, but we don't anticipate the same aggressive launch in China that you've seen in US. We do expect to have a very strong launch in Japan. And also just a shout out to the China team. Despite the significant VBP headwinds that we've seen, which have impacted our IVUS franchise and there will be more VBPs in 2025. We continue to grow essentially at the company average in China despite those headwinds when many of our peers have faced tougher results. Jonathan Monson : Drew, let's take one more question. Operator : Thank you. That question will come from Matt O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Matthew O'Brien: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And I'd much rather focus on all the positive things going on here, but I'm looking at the stock down now versus up prior to this AVANT GUARD commentary. So Dr. Stein, I'm not sure exactly what you can say, but is there any kind of safety signal that we should be aware of? And then if you can't comment on that, is there anything to think about in terms of this patient population really being the cause of the difference, maybe extra lesions that need to be created, higher risk benefit requirements because it's drug-naive patients. Just anything along those lines that you can share because I think folks are pretty nervous this morning just based on how important FARAPULSE is to the business. Thanks. Kenneth Stein : Yes, Matt, again, because this is an ongoing trial, I can't get into any details. Again, what I can say is we are highly confident in the safety of the system. Again, we've got extensive commercial use data and over 125,000 patients treated. We've got extensive published clinical trial data and other ongoing clinical trials and are highly confident in the safety, the efficiency and the efficacy of the FARAPULSE system. Michael Mahoney : We expect to re-launch this trial soon. Jonathan Monson : All right. Thanks, Ken. Thanks, Mike, and thanks, everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific. If we weren't able to get to your question or if you have any follow-ups, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Before you disconnect, Drew will give you all the pertinent details for the replay. Thanks, everyone. Have a great day.

Boston Scientific Corporation disclaims any intention or obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Michael Mahoney. Michael Mahoney : Great. Well done, Jonathan. Thank you everyone for joining us today. In 2024, we had an excellent performance across the board, surpassing our financial goals that we set for the year. This outstanding and differentiated performance is fueled by innovation, and great execution across our global business units, and the earlier than expected approval and adoption of FerraPulse in the U.S. In fourth quarter 2024, company operational sales grew 23% and organic sales grew 20%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of 14% to 16%. Full year 2024 operational sales grew 18.5% while organic sales grew 16% for the year, exceeding our guidance of approximately 15%. We believe that most of our global business units grew in line or faster than their respective markets in 2024, which is a testament to our broad diversified product portfolio and the winning spirit of our global teams. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.70 grew 26%, exceeding the high end of guidance range of $0.64 to $0.66. Full year adjusted EPS of $2.51 grew 22%, also exceeding the high end range of our guidance of $2.40 to $2.47. For the year, we drove 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin to 27%, representing a balance of margin drop through and the revenue upside we saw throughout the year, along with the reinvestment back into the business to drive long-term differentiated growth. Our 2025 outlook, we expect our differentiated financial performance to continue, fueled by our innovative portfolio and strong global execution. And we're guiding to organic growth of 14% to 16% and 10% to 12% for the full year. Our first quarter 2025 adjusted EPS guide is $0.66 to $0.68. We expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $2.80 to $2.87, representing growth of 12% to 14%. Daniel Brennan will provide more details on the financials, and then I'll provide some initial highlights in 2024. Originally, on operational basis, the U.S. grew 31% for the fourth quarter, full year 2024 was 21%, with double-digit growth in six of our eight business units. On an operational basis, Middle East Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 12% in fourth quarter and 14% on the full year. In 2024, we saw above market growth from all business units supported by strong commercial execution, talking about Europe here, and key franchises across the portfolio as well as price discipline. We expect to outpace the market again in 2025 with further momentum in EP, following the recent approval of Fairwave NAV, and increasing contribution from our growth in merchant markets. In Asia Pac, we grew 12% operationally in fourth quarter and 16% for the full year, led by excellent performance and double-digit growth across Japan, China, Australia, New Zealand. Japan really had a nice year growing double digits for the second year in a row. Driven by agent DCB, Resume Watchful Flex Pro, and very early contribution from FerraPulse. On a full year basis, China grew strong double digits across $1 billion in revenue. This differentiated growth in China was fueled by a broad portfolio focus on innovation and excellent commercial execution. Looking ahead, we expect China to grow mid-teens with increasing contribution from Ferropolz and our diverse portfolio, despite the ongoing VBP pricing pressures in the region. I'll now provide some additional commentary on our businesses starting with urology, which grew 8% in the fourth quarter, and 9% for the full year, and on an operational basis grew 20% in fourth quarter and 13% for the full year, following the November close of Axonics. Full year organic growth was fueled by prosthetic urology and stone management, where we had key launches with the Tannacio pump, at AMS-700, and continued success with our expanding LithaView portfolio. Prostate Health also performed well in 2024 with double-digit growth in Resume as well as strong performance and space work. We're pleased to have enrolled our first patient in the HydroSpace trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of our spacer hydrogel. In 2025, we expect to see continued strong above market growth for urology, and look forward to further integrating the highly complementary Axonics technologies into our portfolio. Daniel Brennan : Endoscopy sales grew 8% operationally and 7% in the fourth quarter organically. On a full-year basis, grew 9% operationally and 8% organically. Full year growth was led by double digit growth in our endoluminal surgery and single use imaging franchises along with sustained growth of our Axios platform, where we're investing to drive expanded indications and most recently receiving approval in Japan for Axios for gallbladder drainage. We Within endoluminal surgery, we continue to see positive reimbursement wins for our ESG weight loss Procedure. The recent category one CPT code announced, and now IFSO, an international bariatric committee endorsing ESG with guideline updates. Neuromodulation sales grew 12% operationally and 5% organic in Q4, and the full year basis grew 14% operationally and 3% organically. Brain franchise grew mid single digits in both the quarter and on a full year basis. And our pain franchise grew mid-single digits in the quarter and low single digits for the year. Within deep brain stimulation, we expect improving growth in 2025, with the recent FDA and CE Mark approvals of our unique Cartigia X and HX leads. The first and only sixteen contact directional leads that deliver precise personalized therapy. We also expect higher growth in our pain franchise in 2025, driven by continued strong momentum at Intercept, and the recently released data supporting safety, effectiveness, and durability through five years now. Cardiology delivered an exceptional quarter and year with sales growing 32% in fourth quarter and 25% for the full year. Within cardiology, interventional cardiology therapies sales grew 10% in fourth quarter and 11% for the full year. On a full year basis, the coronary therapies franchise growth driven by strong global performance, in our imaging and complex PCI franchises. And earlier momentum with the U.S. Launch of Agent DCB, which now has additional reimbursement in the outpatient setting. In addition, we recently announced our agreements acquired Bolt Medical, an intravascular lithotripsy platform for treatment of coronary and peripheral artery disease. Bolt's IVL technology is highly synergistic with our existing suite of devices in complex PCI imaging and drug eluting portfolios in both ICTX and PI. And we're excited to close the BOLD acquisition, which we expect to do so in the first half of this year. Our structural heart valves franchise grew double digits for the full year and low single digits fourth quarter. During fourth quarter, we launched our next generation Acura Prime Valve, in Europe, which features frame enhancements, simplified deployment mechanism, and includes a larger valve size. Watchmen sales grew 20% in the fourth quarter and 19% on a full year basis. U.S. Fourth quarter growth of 20% was both bolstered by an increase in concomitant procedures enabled by the new DRG which became effective in October. And positive data from our option trial demonstrating a similar stroke risk reduction with superior bleed risk reduction. Versus OACs in high risk patients following AF ablation. These positive outcomes from option were reaffirmed by data in the concomitant subset of Patience, which was recently presented at the AF Symposium. We're pleased with the performance of our Watchmen business in 2024 and expect this market to continue to grow approximately 20% driven by concomitant procedures ongoing clinical evidence and our initiatives to drive patient awareness, and physician training. Cardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 3% in the quarter and on a full year basis. Our diagnostics franchise grew double digits on a full year basis in outpatient market growth. Driven by our implantable cardiac monitors with early contribution from our Luxe DXG In Europe, In core CRM, in both fourth quarter, and on a full-year basis, both our high-end and low voltage business grew low single digits. As we look ahead, we're excited to bring our EMPowered Levios pacemaker and module the Centimeters system to market in 2025, likely in the second half of the year. Electrophysiology sales grew 172% in fourth quarter. And 139% on a full year basis. FerraPulse has continued to lead the transformation of the AFib market, surpassing $1 billion in revenue in 2024 globally, with over 200,000 patients treated. We expect the AF market to continue to rapidly convert to PFA in 2025 and beyond driven by FerraPulse's exceptional fourth-quarter sales performance, which was driven by FerraPulse uptake in the U.S. and Europe, as a result of a very strong safety profile, ease of use, and procedural efficiency, as well as our launches in both Japan and China. Initial feedback on our integrated system of Fairwave NAV on our OPAL mapping system, which we launched during the fourth quarter in the U.S, has been very positive. We expect to continue to enhance our capabilities in this segment of the market, including with our recently closed acquisition of Cortex, an advanced AF mapping solution. We continue to build the best-in-class compendium of clinical evidence, including the recent results of Phase one of the ADDvantage AF trial. The data demonstrating positive outcomes using FerraPulse system in AF patients, meeting the primary endpoint for efficacy and safety. With zero instances of stroke, pulmonary vein stenosis, esophageal injury, or major access complications. We expect an updated label for persistent AF in the second half of the year. In the coming weeks, we expect to complete the enrollment of Avantgarde evaluating the safety net efficacy of FerraPulse as a first-line treatment for persistent AF compared to antiarrhythmic direct therapy. Additionally, we anticipate data to be presented in the first half of this year from phase two of the ADDvantage AF trial. Evaluating FerraPoint, which is our point-by-point PSA ablation catheter, which is expected to support US FDA approval by year-end 2025. Turning to Purple Interventions, fourth quarter sales grew 22% operationally and 12% organically, on a full year basis, grew 15% operationally and 11% organic. Our interventional oncology and embolization franchise excelled again in 2024, with double-digit growth across the entire product portfolio, and growing mid-teens for the full year. Expanding clinical evidence for new indications continues to be a focus area. We're pleased to have completed enrollment in the first phase of the FRONTIER trial, which is an early feasibility study for the use of Therosphere to treat recurrent glioblastoma. Additionally, we look forward to closing our acquisition of Entera, expecting the first half of 2025, which will broaden our interventional oncology offerings to patients with liver cancer. Within our vascular franchise, on a full year basis, we saw high single-digit arterial performance led by double-digit growth in our drug-leaving portfolio and mid single-digit venous growth led by Gerathena in our cloud management portfolio. On a standalone basis, the silica business grew double digits for the full year and we're pleased to recently share the 30-day results from the ROADSFR-three study demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of TCAR for patients with standard surgical risk. So in closing, I'm very proud of our global team and what we're able to accomplish 2024 resulting in full-year organic growth of 16 adjusted EPS growth of 22%. We're very excited about the future of Boston Scientific Corporation and remain focused on our talents while enhancing our culture that is relentless in driving differentiated results. With that, I'll pass it off to Daniel Brennan to provide more details on the financials. Daniel Brennan : Thanks, Michael. Fourth-quarter 2024 consolidated revenue of $4.561 billion represents 22.4% growth versus fourth quarter 2023, and includes a 70 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, which was unfavorable versus our expectations. Excluding this $26 million foreign exchange headwind, operational revenue growth was 23.1% in the quarter. Sales impact from closed acquisitions contributed 360 basis points resulting in 19.5% organic revenue growth, exceeding our fourth quarter guidance range of 14% to 16%. Q4 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $0.70 grew 26% versus 2023, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.64 to $0.66, primarily driven by our strong sales performance and favorable tax results. Full-year 2024 consolidated revenue of $16.747 billion represents 17.6% reported growth versus full year 2023 and includes a 90 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. Excluding this $127 million headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth for the year was 18.5%. Sales from closed acquisitions contributed 210 basis points resulting in 16.4% organic revenue growth exceeding our guidance range of approximately 15%. Full-year 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $2.51 grew 22% versus 2023 exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $2.45 to $2.47. These results include a $0.05 headwind from FX which was slightly unfavorable to our expectation. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 70.6%, which represents a 20 basis point sequential improvement versus the third quarter and results in full-year 2024 adjusted gross margin of 70.3%. In 2025, we anticipate our full-year adjusted gross margin improving from full-year 2024, and contribute to our adjusted operating margin expansion goal. Fourth-quarter adjusted operating margin was 27.4%, resulting in a full-year 2024 adjusted operating margin of 27.0%, improving 70 basis points versus the full year 2023. We expect to expand adjusted operating margin in 2025 by another 50 to 75 basis points balancing differentiated operating margin expansion, while making targeted investments to fuel long-term top line. On a GAAP basis, fourth-quarter operating margin was 14.8%, resulting in a full-year reported operating margin of 15.5%. Moving to below the line, fourth-quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $87 million resulting in full-year adjusted interest and other expenses of $301 million in line with our expectations. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 11.9% for the full year 2024, including favorable discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Our operational tax rate was 12.3% for the fourth quarter, and 13.2% for the full year, again, in line with expectations. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1.149 billion shares in Q4, and 1.486 billion shares for the full year 2024. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.181 billion, with $1.456 billion from operating activities less $275 million in net capital expenditures which include payments of $177 million related to acquisitions, restructuring, litigation and other special items. Full-year 2024 free cash flow was $2.648 billion, exceeding our expectations and importantly achieving 71% free cash flow conversion for the year. For 2025, we expect free cash flow to be in excess of $3 billion. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash on hand of $414 million and our gross debt leverage ratio was 2.2 times. Our top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A, followed by annual share repurchases. Our legal reserve was $326 million as of December 31, representing a $76 million increase versus Q3 2024, $50 million of this reserve is already funded through our qualified settlement funds. I will now walk through guidance for Q1 and the full year 2025. We expect full-year 2025 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 12.5% to 14.5% versus 2024. Excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, based on current rates, expect full-year 2025 operational growth to be in a range of 13.5% to 15.5%. Excluding a 350 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full-year 2025 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 10% to 12% versus 2024. We expect first-quarter 2025 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 17% to 19% versus the first quarter of 2024, excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, based on current rates, we expect first-quarter 2025 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 18% to 20%. Excluding a 400 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect first-quarter 2025 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 14% to 16% versus 2024. As we indicated on our October call, Jonathan Monson : we had one more business day in the fourth quarter of 2024, which was worth approximately 200 basis points. In the first quarter of 2025, we have one less business day again worth approximately 200 basis points. When adjusting for the impact of business days, Daniel Brennan : the high end of our first-quarter 2025 guidance range is in line with fourth-quarter 2024 organic revenue growth. Jonathan Monson : We expect full-year 2025 adjusted below-the-line expense to be approximately $425 million. Under current legislation, including enacted laws and issued guidance, we forecast a full-year 2025 operational tax rate of approximately 13.5%, and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 12.5%. This includes a benefit from the accounting for stock compensation which we expect will be largely recognized in the first quarter resulting in a forecasted Q1 2025 adjusted tax rate of approximately 11.5%. Expect full-year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.80 to $2.87 representing growth of 12% to 14% versus 2024, including an approximate $0.05 to $0.06 headwind from foreign exchange which is in line with what we saw in 2024. We expect first-quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.66 to $0.68 as it relates to tariffs. We do not have significant levels of manufacturing in or sourcing from Mexico, Canada, or China. As such, while the recent executive actions relative to these countries could present a minor headwind for the year, we view these headwinds as manageable, and they've been contemplated in our guidance ranges. In closing, I'm extremely proud of what our global team delivered for 2024 financial performance and look forward to executing on our full-year 2025 guidance of 10% to 12% organic revenue growth, 50 to 75 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, 12% to 14% adjusted EPS growth. For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2024 financial and operational highlights which outline more details on Q4 results and 2025 guidance. And with that, I'll turn it back to Jonathan Monson, who will moderate Q&A. Jonathan Monson : Thanks, Daniel. Drew, let's open it up for questions for the next thirty-five minutes or so. In order for us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Drew, please go ahead. Operator : We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the key. If at any time your question has been addressed, and you'd like to withdraw your question, please press star then two. Again, please limit yourself to one question. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from Robert Marcus with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Robert Marcus : Oh, great. Good morning, and congratulations on a really good fourth quarter. Wanted to ask on PFA and Watchmen. You had very good fourth quarters here. So, a slight tick-up in in U.S. growth in Watchmen. Would love to get your thoughts on sort of what you saw during the quarter after concomitant reimbursement kicked in October first and the option trial. And how you're thinking specifically about those products throughout 2025 given they're two of your better margin products and the implications. Thanks a lot. Daniel Brennan : Thanks, Robert. Yeah, we have excellent momentum in both FerraPulse and Watchmen, and increasing momentum, I would say. With Watchmen, we did see a bit of a benefit at the end of the fourth quarter with the concomitant news, which confirmed, based on the option trial data, safety and efficacy, with the reimbursement, we saw a little bit of uptick. As we stated before, we think the concomitant reinforces the 20% market CAGR for 2025. We'll be excited about the option readout in the first half of 2026. So we're well positioned with Watchmen. And we obviously continue to invest in our product portfolio, clinical evidence, our clinical teams around the world to fully maximize the concomitant opportunity. And obviously, with the momentum of FerraPulse, and our broader Rhythm Management Portfolio, ideally becoming the partner of choice for AFib and electrophysiologist. FerraPulse, I think the numbers are pretty stand out. Tremendous growth is the biggest transformation that I've seen in MedTech over $1 billion globally in one year. We launched less than a year ago in the U.S., so the execution of our commercial teams has been strong. The execution of our supply chain operation manufacturing to stay ahead of demand has really been impressive. We don't anticipate demand or I'm sorry, supply challenges given the investments that we made throughout the year. And so we're excited about our competitive position with FerraPulse in 2025. You've seen the clinical data. It's a bit unclear as to the competitive landscape in 2025 but we put that aside and we push every day to invest in our commercial execution our R&D and we want to become the clear leader as we are now in PFA as PFA is really transforming this market. Robert Marcus : Appreciate it. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question comes from Lawrence Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Lawrence Biegelsen : Obviously, a stellar quarter and year. Mike and Dan, I was hoping to ask one kind of long-term question. At JPMorgan, you increased your weighted average market growth to 9% in 2026. And, you know, I know you expect to grow faster than your end mark so does this imply you see Boston Scientific Corporation as at least a 9% grower in 2026? And can you grow EPS double-digits next year with the tax rate increasing by 200 to 300 basis points? Thanks a lot. Michael Mahoney : Sure, and, obviously, we're not gonna give any specific guidance relative to anything beyond 2025. But I think safe to assume as we've done over the last decade very well as a team, we seek to outgrow our end markets. So as those grow at an increasing rate, we still look to outgrow those markets. So I would stay tuned as we get through the year, potentially have an Investor Day at the end of this year and reset those goals for the long term. But we're excited if you look over the last decade to see the increase in that WAMGR very intentionally over that timeframe with both internal investments as well as smart tuck in acquisitions to get to that 9% by 2026. Relative to double-digit EPS, again, I I point to the track record, extremely strong record of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. That's always the goal. We'll see what happens to the tax rate. That could be obviously a fluid environment. In Washington, so if there's even an increase in that tax rate, our goal will still be to get double the GDP growth in 2026 and beyond. Lawrence Biegelsen : Alright. Thanks, Daniel. Operator : The next question comes from Frederick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead. Frederick Wise : Good morning, everybody, and thanks for the great quarter. Maybe it's a one and a quarter of a question. You typically start the year in what I like to call prudently conservative fashion in recent years. Maybe you can help us better understand where the upside and where the risks are. And should we view this as another attempt to start the year in a thoughtfully, prudently conservative fashion. And related to that, Daniel, how are you thinking about competition on the PFA side coming in? What is dialed into your guidance at this point? Thank you. Michael Mahoney : Hey, Frederick. You certainly want us to be thoughtful and prudent which we always are. Our guidance, and we have a nice track record of delivering on our commitments. So I would say that's the same strategy as we provided the guide in 2025. Clearly, the company has a lot of momentum. I would say we do have more tailwinds. You know, when you think about the tailwinds, there's a lot of momentum across every region. You obviously know about the FairPulse momentum in the U.S., and we're early days of our launch in Japan and China, a dominant really a big shout out to our coronary team, ICTX, with the agent launch. Other businesses like IO growing mid-teens, and our Endo Euro, PI, and Neuromod business, all very solid growth and we expect Neuromod to be above market in 2025. So strong momentum there on the tailwind side. There could be stronger PFA competition in 2025. A lot of that is, you know, out of our hands, but we, as I said before, we're focused on driving forward when we'll see every day, China VBP is more extensive this year in 2025 than it has been in the past. But despite that, we expect to grow mid-teens in China in 2025, but that'll be a little more difficult for us this year. And, you know, there are also some continuing strengthening lower cost competitors, I would say, for some of our med surg businesses in Asia. And in Europe. And the team is focused on our portfolio and innovation to counteract that, but that is a bit of a headwind for us in our endo and euro business. But overall, we feel that we certainly do have more tailwinds than headwinds and we are looking forward to it here. Frederick Wise : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning and nice end to the year. I want to spend just a little bit of time talking about margins, interest expansion. Sort of curious how do you think about managing that and I'm gonna sneak in a cash flow question. You're kicking out a lot of cash, how do you think about investing it? Thank you. Daniel Brennan : Sure, Joanne. I I can take that. I'll tell you what I really like about 2025 is the equation the operating margin expansion. Done it very well over the last decade each year with a variety of different scenarios. But I think one of the optimal scenarios is where gross margin goes north, SG and A, you get leverage. And then I think in 2025, you might actually see a little bit of an uptick in R and D spend as a percentage of sales. I think that's a winning hand for how to increase operating margin overall. And so in our 50 to 75 basis points, I'd look for gross margin to get better versus the 70.3% that we put up in 2024. I'd look for SG and A on the 10% to 12% sales growth to improve its leverage there and deliver margin expansion. And then, again, on R and D, not a significant increase. But, you know, maybe 20, 30 basis points of an uptick in R and D. To continue to help to fuel the top-line growth for the long term. I think that's a great equation for 25% for margin expansion. Cash flow, Oh, I could. You saw in if you heard in the commentary, we got to 71% free cash flow conversion. That wasn't by accident. That's a tremendous effort by the entire global team. On reducing DIOH, reducing DSO strong working capital management and of course, obviously significant growth in operating income. In terms of our capital allocation strategy, no change. It's worked well for us again over the last decade to have the number one priority for our for use of our cash to be high-quality tuck in innovative M&A. That will continue and then annual share repurchase after that. We ended the year at 2.2 times debt after the Axonics and Silk Road acquisitions. We're in a real great spot to continue to do that strategy and execute that strategy in 2025 and beyond. Joanne Wuensch : Terrific. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. David Roman : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I wanted just to dive into some of the different drivers here around the EP business. Clearly, on the FerraPulse side, you've seen huge conversion on that de novo paroxysmal segment of the market. But as you gain a persistent indication and then also launch FerraPoint exiting 2026, can you maybe help us think about the segment of the market that you're not able to address today and how much market becomes available to you with FerraPoint and the persistent indication? And then maybe as a corollary to that, help us think through kind of the the mapping strategy given your installed base relative to the other two participants in the market? And how you're thinking about remaining an open platform versus potentially looking to become more closed on as as some of your peers are? Michael Mahoney : I'll turn over to Dr. Stein here. Kenneth Stein : Thanks, David. I'm going to start with the mapping strategy first. I guess as you point out, right, we intend to maintain an open platform. We don't need to force people to use our OPAL mapping system. And I think it's actually really important as we look o six. How the business evolves globally, as well as we look at potential future moves into, like, an ASC type environment. To be able to support doing cases without mapping. To be able to support doing cases with competitive mapping systems but also to provide differentiated features within OPAL and our Fairview software package. Yes. I think it provides the best possible solution for people who want to map their cases. And even though it's early into the launch of Fairwave Nav and Fairview in the US, we've really been very pleased with the feedback that we've gotten. Thus far. In terms of drivers, an important technology, right, that. The persistent atrial fibrillation population just in prevalence terms, is at least as large and probably larger than the population with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. I'd also acknowledge that we are already seeing off-label use of FerraPulse in treating patients with atrial with persistent atrial fibrillation. It's why it was important for us to run trials like VANTAGE and Avant Garde, I think everyone's seen the data from the ADVANTAGE trial. And that all of our endpoints in terms of safety and efficacy in treating persistent atrial fibrillation. And so we do anticipate getting that label by the end of this year. Beyond that, right, then the next drivers in terms of at least expanding our labeling, as you say, getting FerraPoint to be used as an adjunct for treating atrial flutter in patients who are undergoing ablation for atrial fibrillation. Avant Garde moving to first-line therapy and also our REMATCH trial, which will qualify labeling beyond de novo use, but use in patients where they're going through repeat anti-ablations procedures. David Roman : Very helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Travis Steed : Hey, congrats on the quarter and also thanks for posting the slide deck early on. That was really helpful. I wanted to ask about M&A strategy. Now that you're kind of analyzing kind of seventeen billion in revenue and that revenue base is growing so fast. So much faster. Like, how do you balance that it's gonna take a larger deal to kinda move the needle on such a larger revenue base, but also, you know, finding growth accretive deals that, now that your baseline growth is so much faster already, just kind of thinking about like, your M&A strategy changes now that you're a bigger company and growing so much faster? Michael Mahoney : It doesn't change that much. We're always investing for the long term at Boston Scientific Corporation. We obviously gave 2025 guide, but as we've said before, another conference in January, we're investing for products that won't be launched until 2030. Through internal organic M&A, through our VC portfolio, which is very extensive. We did nine new investments in our VC portfolio in 2025. And you're aware of the tuck-in acquisitions that we've done in 2025 for four or five of those. And so the formula remains. We really are focused on increasing our WAMGR, which was Dan talked about earlier, which just by 9% in 2026. Growing fashion that WAMGR consistently quarter by quarter, year over year, doing everything we can to enhance that WAMGR through those tools of internal R and D, VC portfolio and tuck-in M&A. So as the company gets larger, become larger every year, and we continue to find ways to improve our WAMGR and exceed the growth of our WAMR. So we placed a lot of focus and time internally on ensuring that we'll be a differentiated company in 2030 beyond 2025. Travis Steed : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Patrick Wood : Beautiful. I'd love to just broaden out a little bit. I appreciate the endoscopy business is kind of singles and doubles. But, you know, obviously, you guys have been flagging Apollo ESG. Quite a unique approach and illuminal. I'm super curious even though they're down a bit, there's a chunk of sleeves that are still done in the US, and it seems like a way better approach. I'm super curious how you think midterm, you know, how big that business could be, how you're feeling about the initial launch there, and just anything you gotta give us on ESG, I'd love to hear it. Thanks. Michael Mahoney : I would say that ties to the previous question. Investing in ESG now. We have a dedicated team that our group has organized on the ESG product around Apollo. We have dedicated clinical trials to broaden that indication out, improve the clinical science behind it. We have some recent momentum with CPG codes. So it's gonna be a nice driver over the long term for Endo. Yeah, it's not gonna reshape Boston Scientific Corporation or Endo in 2025. But we definitely see positive support by the physicians, by the industry groups, the reimbursements. We're unique and we're likely the only one who can offer the Apollo Procedure wrapped around with our other endo tools. So we think this will be a significant growth driver for Endo as you look towards the longer term of this wrap plant. Patrick Wood : Love it. Thanks for the question. Operator : The next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Please go ahead. Danielle Antalffy : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really strong year. Just a quick question at a high level. You know, we talk we focus so much on the major growth drivers like FerraPulse and Watchmen. I'm just curious, Mike or Dan, where you think Boston Scientific Corporation's either underperforming or under-indexed, but see an opportunity or line of sight into improving performance over the next year or two. That maybe the street's under modeling or not appreciating. Thanks so much. Michael Mahoney : Yes. So most of our businesses did well against peers in the market and growing faster than the CAGR. Even if you take out Watchmen and FerraPulse results, the rest of businesses grew faster than WAMCORE. A couple of areas that we want to improve on in 2025, one is the overall NERMOT performance, which we anticipate will have a nicer improvement in 2025. With the launch in our DBS platform, we expect that to gain momentum in 2025. In the combination of our refocused commercial team in pain, and the benefit of relieving. So we do anticipate a better year for Neuromod. We want to strengthen US CRM. We continue to maintain share, I would say, in terms of the unit volume perspective and high voltage. We don't have the portfolio yet in Leadless Pacemaker. Which has a strong higher ASP which is driving on a dollar basis share loss in PACER. So we'd like to see improvement in our overall U.S. CRM business. We're launching SICU with a Leadless pacemaker in the back half of 2025. And we'll have increased focus on that business in 2025. So we'd like to see some improvements there. And as I mentioned before, we do see some increasing competition in some of our businesses from the lower cost competitors. So we're challenging our team to continue to drive a lower cost portfolio so we can serve our global customers more efficiently. Danielle Antalffy : Thank you for that. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Polark with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Michael Polark : Good morning. Thank you. I want to ask on the TAVR or the structural part update in the deck. Low single-digit growth in the fourth quarter, you just comment on kinda post-account IDE, that the influence that's driving the d cell there, or are there other things you'd call out? And then maybe pester for an update on the path in the US for your TAVR franchise. Thank you. Michael Mahoney : Sure. On the U.S., we haven't provided any updates. We're still in discussions internally and with the appropriate authorities there. So again, in some of the other calls, you'll receive an update once we can give you clear direction on that. In Europe, we did see some impact in EU based on the U.S. trial. But nonetheless, the team did have a strong year in TAVR in Europe. And we're launching Prime to centers primarily who are current users of Accurate today. Operator : The next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the nice win here. Maybe my one question is around mapping. What percentage of PFA procedures do you think are associated with mapping? And once you launch your mapping technology, when you look at the medium term, what percentage of those mapping procedures do you think we'll be using a Boston Scientific Corporation solution versus a competition? Michael Mahoney : Yes. So I would just reinforce and Kenneth can comment further. Ken's overall strategy is an open platform. We do see mapping as a predominant modality, if you will, in the U.S. EU, you see more centers using without mapping. We do see some very high volume centers in the U.S. for PBI also not mapping. But predominantly, it's a heavy mapping region in the U.S. Little bit less so, still quite a bit in Europe. And heavy mapping in Japan and China. So as Kenneth said, we do believe that the OPAL platform is the best platform to optimize the use of variables. And we'll continue to enhance the OPAL platform as we continue to enhance FerraPulse catheter category and widen that out more. So we think that's the most cost-effective and the most efficient way to use FerraPulses is with OPAL. That being said, many physicians are used to competitive mapping systems, so excellent. We'll continue to ensure that they can use competitive mapping systems. On the share percent, we wouldn't speculate there. It's a big investment area for us in terms of technology and physical clinical mappers around the world to continue to enhance that group. A lot of investment behind that. And hopefully, we'll make good progress in that area in 2025. Kenneth Stein : I don't have too much to add to what Mike just said. I just reiterate, Europe predominant cases are done without mapping today. U.S., vast majority of procedures are done with mapping today. Intend to support all different workflows. Goal is to make things easier for physicians, not harder. And I think what you're gonna see over the long run is, right, the simpler the case is, the easier it is to do and more efficient it is to do without any mapping, the more complex the case is, the greater the need for mapping. We believe that we've got some really important differentiated advantages with FerraVu on OPAL, it's also behind our acquisition of Cortex, which is an AS mapping specifically AF mapping, platform for for very complex types of atrial fibrillation. And I mean, our goal overall, not just with MATIC, as we look at just EP strategy overall, right, is to provide physicians with the widest possible toolbox so they have exactly what they need to treat the particular patient who's in front of them. Vijay Kumar : Alright. Thank you guys. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Peter Chickering : Hey, good morning. Look, as you comp out the China VBP and Japanese reimbursement cuts in the back half of the year, how should those markets be growing in the back half of this year without those cuts? And can you refresh us on the key drivers in both those markets? Thanks. Michael Mahoney : Those cuts are happening, so we baked that into our guide. China really impressive performance given the VBP which really is like taking a daily vitamin. It is. It happens every year. But the team continues to grow nicely above market and in line or faster than Boston Scientific Corporation in China. So we'll have more VBP, you know, tailwinds or headwinds, I guess, this year but they're overcome by product launches, FerraPulse, diversification of our portfolio, and greater access to more customers. It really speaks to the category leadership portfolio strategy we have across the company. So the team there continues to do well. Kenneth Stein : Japan, again, there's typically every other year price cuts in Japan. That we would know about them. They're built into our guidance. Japan is going to have a really nice year this year with the launch of FerraPulse. Daniel Brennan : And just an operating margin comment on that. So even with despite the price cuts in those countries, we still ask for and get operating margin improvement in those countries. So it's like we ask of every business unit that we have. So despite absorbing those price cuts, the operating margin for both those countries you mentioned goes north each year as well. Operator : The next question comes from Joshua Jennings with TD Cowen. Joshua Jennings : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And congrats on the year. I wanted to just, Mike, get your views and maybe weigh too early with the new administration issuing some policy decisions, getting some nominees through the congressional process. Can you just talk about from a high level, any risk you see to the medical devices sector in general or to Boston Scientific Corporation specifically with this new leadership in place? Thanks for taking the question. Michael Mahoney : It's really a dynamic environment. We think our guide, as best we can, encompasses macro challenges around the world, including tariffs. FX is really not a policy name, but tariffs are probably the biggest one, which think is very manageable. We aim to hope that the FTC environment is appropriate. And so maybe that could be positive for the industry. We'll see on tax reform where that goes. Daniel made comments on that. But other than that, Med Tech typically hasn't been the tip of the spear for major policy changes over many, many different types of presidents that we've had. So we feel overall very comfortable with our guidance and how we can manage through that. Joshua Jennings : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Christopher Pasquale with Cefran Research. Please go ahead. Christopher Pasquale : Thanks. You talked about the move to concomitant procedures being a growth sustainer rather than a catalyst for faster LA market growth. Our own conversations with High Line Center suggests many of them are expecting a meaningful uptick in their own procedures as a result of that change. So is there something else that you think really offsets that tailwind then maybe for Dr. Stein, can you just remind us how you think about the portion of the AF population that is really appropriate for both of these procedures? Michael Mahoney : Yeah. On the volume side, we'll see over time. Right now, we're kind of calling it 20% market CAGR. As the market gets bigger and larger, it's that along with EP is the best market you can be in MedTech. We have a unique position in both of them. So I think we're comfortable with the 20% CAGR now. We'll see as the year progresses if that upticks or not. Want to continue to work with customers on productivity and workflow. They have tremendous demands that they have on their cath labs. There's other technologies and structural heart coming out and so forth. They're very, very comfortable with Watchmen FerraPulse, and the concomitant procedures. So we want to continue to work to make sure we can drive operational effectiveness and productivity for our customers who are still have a strong backlog and demand of patients and other technologies coming out. So besides safety effectiveness, we want to make sure Watchmen and FerraPulse really is the solution in terms of ease of use and procedural efficiency for hospitals. Kenneth Stein : And Christopher, just in terms of who are appropriate candidates for these procedures, again, we're very pleased with the results of Option. I think it shows really incontrovertibly that the WATCHMAN device, yes, at least as effective as oral anticoagulants and treating high-risk patients after AF ablation that it is certainly safer in terms of long-term leading risk. It also showed that you can do a concomitant procedures, in a randomized trial that there was no added risk by heading WATCHMAN to an AF ablation at the same time as the procedure. Particularly with FerraPulse, given its safety advantages, and isn't its efficiency and really facilitates people doing concomitant procedures. And as you said, we've certainly seen an uptick in concomitant procedures still do need to get our label expanded for WATCHMAN to allow for use as first-line therapy in people who don't otherwise already have a reason to avoid the long-term use of our ointment coagulants. We will be presenting the CHAMPION data in the first half of next year as a first line even in patients who aren't candidates for AF ablation. Today in the United States, between a half and two-thirds of patients undergoing ablation are considered to be at high risk of stroke. If you look at the CHAS VAST score, right, which is the scoring system we use, if you use transfusion s three or higher as your cutoff, that would be about a half of patients undergoing AF ablation. I think it's also important to point out when you think about concomitant procedures, there are patients who are undergoing AF ablation who may get their WATCHMAN Thanks. A kind of Watchmen that they might have otherwise gotten. We're also patients who were referred in for a WATCHMAN procedure who are now being considered for ablation, might never been considered previously for ablation, again, just given the safety and efficacy advantages of the FerraPulse system. Christopher Pasquale : So, great for patients. Right? Saves them having to undergo two consecutive procedures. It's also great for hospitals and practitioners. That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : I understand there's time for one last question. That comes from SURE Marie Thibault with BTIG. Please go ahead. Marie Thibault : Thanks so much for squeezing me in. I want to ask a question about a recent acquisition. I saw that interventional oncology and embolization killed it again this quarter. I wanted to understand what's going on in that product segment and understand how the Entera Oncology acquisition fits into that product segment, how it can help accelerate growth? So much for taking the questions. Michael Mahoney : Yes. So that division of interventional oncology doesn't get talked about enough, mid-teens for the full year. Again, it's in line with our category leadership strategy that we have across most of our business units. The team had a really excellent launch of organic R and D program in our robotics portfolio, which is a big growth driver for us. Obviously, Y90 does extremely well for us. So the combination of those two products and the rest of the remaining portfolio that we have gives us the widest portfolio and unique differentiation within there with our to capture high share at a partner with customers much like we do with other businesses in the acquisition, is again another extension for us to widen out to other adjacencies in interventional oncology with the pump. Portfolio. This gets us closer to the oncologist. Yeah. We also have additional software enhancements coming to improve the efficiency and workflow of our Y90 coming in 2025. So we want to continue much like we do with our other business units to expand into smart adjacencies, to accelerate our growth, and enable us to partner more closely with the enrichoradiologists and oncologists team.
