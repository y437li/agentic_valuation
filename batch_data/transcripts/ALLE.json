[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Martineau, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Tom Martineau : Thanks, Shannon, and good morning, and welcome to the First Quarter 2014 Allegion Earnings Call. With me today is Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion.  We released earnings last night at 5 p.m. The release and presentation that we will refer to in today's call have been posted on our website. If you would like to view this presentation, please go to the Investor Relations section of our website at allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website. Statements made in -- please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.  Our release and today's commentary includes non-GAAP financial measures, which excludes an order flow change with the joint venture in Asia, restructuring costs and spin costs related to our separation from Ingersoll Rand. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior year periods. Please reference our news release and tables, which provide the reconciliation of reported to adjusted results.  With that, please go to Slide 3. And I'll turn the call over to Dave. David Petratis : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. This marks our first full quarter as a stand-alone publicly traded company, and we're excited to share our progress as we unlock our potential at Allegion. In the first quarter, we delivered reported earnings per share of $0.37, which includes $0.07 of restructuring and one-time separation costs resulting in an adjusted earnings per share of $0.44. Revenues were $472 million, up 3.7% on an adjusted basis versus last year, and up 3% on an organic basis. All regions delivered positive growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating income of $76 million increased 3.8% versus the prior year, and adjusted operating margins remained flat at 16.1%.  We were pleased with the results in the first quarter. And similar to most industrials operating in the U.S., we had to navigate tough weather conditions early in the quarter. March performance in our nonresidential America's business was markedly better than the beginning of the quarter, which we feel is a better indicator of the long-term health of the nonresidential construction markets. This view is also supported by our specification and quote trends, which increased in the mid to high teens as compared to the prior year, a good leading indicator of performance typically 9 to 18 months in the future.  We are making good progress on our EMEIA actions and continue to see market growth in the Asia Pacific region. We are also affirming our full-year guidance Please go to Slide 4. By now, you will recognize our key strategies, which we will use to deliver profitable growth in achievement of our long-term objectives. We continue to see great progress on our electronic offerings, both in the residential and nonresidential space. As an example, we recently announced the launch of our new Connected Touchscreen Residential lock, which will add to our already strong growth profile in the electronic locking categories in the Americas. Through our open architecture connected platform, users have the capability to manage their home security from anywhere in the world from an Internet connected device, regardless of their selected home automation platform. Our line of keyless electronic locks offers the strength, peace in mind and ease of installation and retrofit that our customers desire. I've had an opportunity to drill down on our innovation pipeline this past quarter, and I'm convinced that our investment in R&D to drive new innovative products will continue to position us as an industry leader in technology development. I'm truly excited about our future prospects in both the commercial and residential markets. On the M&A front, the overall pipeline is starting to progress nicely. We've been active in the first quarter, and although relatively small transactions, they are aligned with the areas of focus that we previously discussed, emerging markets, emerging technologies and product portfolio expansion. Yesterday, we announced the acquisition of Fire and Security hardware, a leading electromechanical locking provider in Australia. This transaction strengthens Allegion's presence in the Australian security market with a strong brand name and product portfolio, while bringing innovative technologies that can be applied globally.  I'd like to take a moment to provide an early update on our EMEIA progress. As of previously announced, Lucia Moretti was appointed as our leader of EMEIA business located in Faenza, Italy. Lucia has wasted no time in adding significant value to EMEIA improvement plans, leveraging her past knowledge and experience in similar situations. In early April, initial actions were unveiled to streamline deployment of assets and resources to improve profitability and customer focus. We continue to strengthen our execution in markets where we have the right products to be successful and have made changes to streamline operating divisions, provide better focus on the customer, and strengthen our leading positions. We've also made decisions to exit certain markets that are less profitable, dilute resources and are not scalable. We continue to identify in which areas we can reduce our overhead cost. We remain on track with respect to the work required, and we'll continue to see operational improvement with a step up in the second half of 2014 after full implementation of these actions.  Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to update our 2014 outlook. Patrick Shannon : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please go to Slide #5. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $472.5 million, reflecting a decrease of 0.2% versus the prior year. In the fourth quarter of 2013, a change was made to the order flow with our consolidated joint venture in Asia. As previously reported, the joint venture acted as a pass-through of products to the end customer. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, products are shipped direct from the supplier to the end customer, with the joint venture receiving a royalty in amount that approximates the loss margin on revenue. Accordingly, the joint venture will no longer recognize the revenue and cost of goods sold on these products. This impacts the revenue comparisons, but does not materially impact income or cash flows in future periods. For the first quarter, the revenue impact was $17.7 million; for the second quarter, $17.4 million; and for the third quarter, $16.9 million, resulting in a full year impact of $52 million. Adjusting prior periods for the order flow change, net revenues for the quarter increased by 3.7%. Organic growth, which excludes the impact of our Colombia acquisition and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, was up 3%. All regions reported adjusted revenue growth in the quarter compared to the prior-year period. We were pleased with the quarterly performance of the business, given the weather induced headwinds experienced early in the quarter.  Adjusted operating income increased by 3.8% compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margins were 16.1% in the quarter, flat to the first quarter 2013. The company effectively managed and implemented price increases and productivity gains to offset inflation, incremental investments and unfavorable business mix. The operational improvements provided the funding for new product development and channel investments. Please go to Slide #6. Now I'd like to discuss our earnings per share performance. This slide shows our EPS walk for the  first quarter. For the first quarter 2013, reported EPS was $0.41 per share. Adjusting for prior year restructuring expenses of $0.04, the 2013 adjusted EPS was $0.45. Operational results increased EPS by $0.05 as pricing and productivity more than offset inflation. Note that pricing actions were taken in the quarter to offset increased inflation as discussed on our fourth quarter 2013 earnings call, particularly in Venezuela.  The next item on the reconciliation relates to the $0.05 year-over-year benefit related to the foreign currency loss recorded in the first quarter 2013 from the devaluation of the bolivar. We will speak more to the risk of a future bolivar devaluation later in our presentation. The effective tax rate of 30.3% drove $0.01 EPS improvement versus the prior year. The 2014 quarterly rate was slightly better than full-year guidance driven by net favorable discrete tax items. The comparative effective tax rate in the first quarter 2013 of 32.3% was better than the 2013 full year effective rate as it also reflected one-time discrete tax items in the quarter. As Dave will discuss later, the discrete tax items are not considered material on a full year basis, and our full year tax rate guidance still approximates 31%.  The next item reflects incremental investment in ongoing growth initiatives, which was a $0.03 reduction. Lastly, a reduction of $0.09 related to the incremental interest expense incurred as a result of the additional indebtedness associated with the spinoff from Ingersoll Rand, this resulted in adjusted first quarter 2014 EPS of $0.44 per share. Continuing on, we have a $0.07 EPS reduction for restructuring and spin-related expenses to arrive at the first quarter 2014 reported EPS of $0.37. The reduction is predominantly driven by one-time separation costs, but also includes a small amount related to EMEIA restructuring.  Please go to Slide #7. First quarter revenues for the Americas region were up 3.5% on an adjusted basis, and up 3.7% on an organic basis. Improved pricing, higher volumes and the acquisition of Schlage de Colombia in January 2014 offset unfavorable currency movement in Canada. Residential revenue growth reflected strength in the retail, builder and e-commerce channels. Commercial revenues were up slightly in the quarter and essentially flat excluding the previously mentioned acquisition. And although nonresidential revenue showed growth in March, it did not fully compensate for weather-driven construction impacts early in the quarter. Adjusted operating margins for the quarter were up 30 basis points as pricing and productivity more than offset higher inflation, incremental investment and unfavorable business mix related to the higher growth of residential revenue compared to commercial revenue.  Please go to Slide #8. We were pleased with the ongoing progress in EMEIA as reflected in the first quarter results. First quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were up 4.4% and up 0.3% on an organic basis. We see continued indicators of a moderate economic recovery in the region, but improvement remains gradual. The organic revenue growth was driven by moderate price improvements, offsetting slightly negative volume reflecting ongoing actions to selectively exit unprofitable markets. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 0.5%, up 150 basis points compared to the prior-year period. The favorable improvement is driven by price, cost containment, productivity and 2013 restructuring benefits. As we did in the prior quarter, we continue to realize the efforts of our focused plan to improve profitability. With the additional actions planned and beginning to be executed, we remain on target to reflect a 300-basis-points improvement and operating margin for the full year.  Please go to Slide #9. First quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were up 3.3%, and up 4.5% on an organic basis. Volume improvements in commercial hardware and emerging markets more than compensated for unfavorable currency movements and declines in the system integration business, mostly timing-driven. First quarter tends to be the softest revenue quarter in the region reflecting the holiday seasonality and variability in our system integration business as project awards and order flows are typically completed in the second half of the year. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was down $1.8 million driven by nonrecurring favorable adjustment recorded in the first quarter of 2013. Excluding this impact, the region would've seen a slight increase in income, reflecting favorable volume and productivity, offsetting inflation and investment. Operating margins are scheduled to improve sequentially as revenue increases with the seasonality of the business. Please go to Slide #10. Turning our attention to available cash flow, you will see that we used $10.1 million of net cash in the first quarter. This is typical over historical cash flow and reflects seasonal use of working capital. The decrease in available cash versus 2013 reflects incremental capital expenditures for new systems, new product development and productivity investments. We continue to manage our working capital effectively as our cash conversion cycle has been reduced by 12% compared to the prior-year period, reflecting improvements in both receivable and inventory turnover. I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our 2014 guidance. David Petratis : Thanks, Patrick. Please go to Slide 11. We are affirming our previous guidance for 2014. Our full year adjusted year-over-year revenue forecast remains up 3.5% to 4.5%. We still see opportunity in North America for full year nonresidential growth in the low- to mid-single digits, weighted to the second half of the year.  Of note, market growth continues to be led by traditional commercial segments with institutional segments lagging. Adjusted earnings per share are forecasted to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.40, an increase of 6% to 13% from 2013 adjusted earnings per share. We anticipate earnings growth will accelerate in the second half of this year due to higher volumes, 2014 European actions and a wider spread in the effective tax rate. Restructuring and spin costs are still expected to be $0.25 to $0.30 of impact during the year, resulting in a reported EPS range of $1.95 to $2.15. The effective tax rate in the guidance remains at approximately 31%, reflecting the result of the new tax structure and tax pricing [ph] strategies executed in construction with the spinoff. Finally, the guidance does not reflect the potential risk of devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar.  Currently, there are 3 exchange mechanisms administrated by the Venezuelan government, each with a different exchange rate. Given the uncertainty to predict at what rate would be accepted under any supplement exchange rates, we believe that fixed official rate of 6.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar remains the most appropriate. Aligned with this decision, it is important to note that our Venezuelan business requires minimal imports to operate successfully, which minimizes the exposure that has challenged other companies that have a high dependence on imports. For more information on this topic, please refer to our Form 10-Q filed with the Securities Exchange Commission for the period ended March 31, 2014.  Please go to Slide 12. We completed our first quarter as a stand-alone company, and I'm especially proud of our 8,000-plus employees who continue to put into place all the things that are necessary to operate independently, while staying focused on satisfying our loyal customer base. We strive to create peace of mind by pioneering safety and security and we continue to unlock the potential of Allegion. We delivered solid Q1 performance, while investing in the future. We remain committed to executing our long-term strategy of driving organic growth, adding bolt-on acquisitions, executing on operational excellence, EMEIA margin improvement and leveraging our tax structure. Last, we continue to execute a balanced capital allocation strategy to deliver shareholder value.  Now, Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jeff Kessler of Imperial Capital. Jeffrey Kessler : First, with regard to Europe, could you get a little more specific as to what types of businesses are you looking for, the characteristics of the businesses that you're looking for to acquire in Europe and the characteristics of the businesses you're looking to or the areas you're looking to get out of? I know you described it a little bit before, but I'm wondering if you can get a little more granular on the types of things that you're looking for to go into and to get out of? David Petratis : So, our #1 focus in Europe is executing a restructuring plan. We think that's 24 months to get this business at the profitability levels that we think are appropriate with the, really, the 6 markets that I described at Analyst Day that we can be successful with. Second, as we look at our portfolio, we believe there's areas in those markets where we can win, and there's areas in those markets where we do not have the scale or market positions to be successful over the long-term, and we will exit those markets. In terms of acquisitions, the region is not a high priority, but if there's a technology move that will complement the balance of our portfolio globally, we will go down those path. Jeffrey Kessler : Okay. And that would include paying up for companies that have that technology? David Petratis : We will always be mindful of the returns that we can get on an investment like that, that complements our portfolio. But sometimes, in my history, when we see technology that can complement, you pay up for it. Jeffrey Kessler : Okay. The second question, my follow-up question is, your U.S. resi business, you described it -- you describe it as one of the drivers in the first quarter, and one of the things that's been out there, particularly in the market, and in terms of some of the, let's say, the buzz that's going on in the industry is this new Schlage electronic wireless lock. Is this a big driver of what you consider to be, let me just put it out there, a residential drive that you're trying to make in the U.S.? I know it's a very substantial portion of Schlage to begin with, but is this going to increase? Does this lock have the potential to increase the percentage of resi business within Schlage? David Petratis : I believe that we have the strongest portfolio of electronic locks in the North American market, and that's reflected with almost a 50% market share. I'm very pleased with the profitability of this. I think what we're moving to with our new e-lock is a very strong position in open platforms. We were a bit handcuffed with potential buyers because of our lead with, what I'd call, closed platforms. And I believe we've got the best mechanical security, a class I lock with open technology that is purely keyless, and I think it positions us nicely for future growth. Jeffrey Kessler : Okay. And I am sorry, just one quick, real quick update on Venezuela. Realizing that many companies have gone to Sicad I or -- which is at a 11, and the Sicad II, which is at 51, I'm curious about your decision to remain at the official government rate. Patrick Shannon : Yes, so Jeff, let me tackle that a little bit, and just a little bit of background information, as we previously disclosed. Our Venezuelan business in total from a revenue perspective is about $60 million to $70 million per annum, so it's a small piece of our overall portfolio. And as Dave mentioned earlier, most of the business down there is sourced, manufactured, distributed and sold in the local markets. So we don't have a lot of imports. As a matter of fact, it's like $1 million per annum. So we're not really highly dependent upon exchanging local currency for U.S. dollars. If you kind of look at the decisions relative to this, the other thing I would add is that from my dividend perspective, we don't have the capability or ability to dividend money out, so that's one of the factors. The Sicad I rate currently is not available to us. It does come intermittently, but currently it's not available to us. And the Sicad II rate, as we understand, is a very illiquid market. One of which we would not advocate exchanging local currency for U.S. dollars given that exchange rate. So if you kind of look at all these factors, one, we don't have a need to exchange local currency to dollars, nor do we have an intent to do so. And third, it's not available, so our conclusion was it's best at this point, to continue with the official rate. We'll continue to monitor the situation. I think it would be a little bit disingenuous not knowing perhaps, what the devaluation would be at in the future to go forward with the devaluation. Operator : Our next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski of MKM partners. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Just first on European margins. Nice eeked-out profit there in what is typically a pretty big loss quarter. If you could help us maybe on the cadence as we go through the year? I was surprised just given how much you were able to narrow that gap early on, why you're still able to -- or why you're still committed to the 4% target and why that may not move higher? So any understanding of maybe -- particularly, the 2Q to 3Q dynamic with some of the shutdowns later in the summer there of how we should think about the margin cadence the next 2 quarters. Patrick Shannon : Yes, so as we mentioned, I think we've made some really good progress there in margin improvement, and what you're seeing there is a combination of things. But primarily, you're seeing the benefits of some restructuring efforts we took in 2013, as well as some cost containment. Kind of going forward, we will continue to be profitable in all the quarters, and the step up improvement really begins to accelerate in both the second and third quarters. You may recall last year, 2013, the losses were actually accelerating in Q2, Q3, so the comparisons get easier for us. But we would continue to see margin improvements, and the biggest change you would see would be in Q3. Particularly as we begin to implement some of the actions we talked about, they'll be executed in 2014 in terms of exiting on profitable markets and pruning some of our cost structure further this year. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got you. So in Q2 then, does that -- is there another big step up just with seasonality? Or how should we think about 2Q? Patrick Shannon : Yes. It's not a significant step up. It is a margin improvement both sequentially, as well as year-over-year. The step ups, really, from a significant perspective occur in Q3, Q4. We're still on target for the 300 basis-point margin improvement for the full year. And we'll be looking to exit the year on a full-year run rate basis in the mid-single digits from an OI perspective. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got you, that's helpful. And then, just moving onto the North American business, obviously, a lot of disruption for weather -- from weather. Can you give us a sense of how, maybe, March and April as you see it? Maybe you haven't closed yet -- trended on commercial versus resi to give us a better sense on how those are doing on an underlying basis. David Petratis : I've got no perspective on April. Clearly, better than what -- in terms of business volumes activity, better than we were seeing in January and February. [indiscernible] into the heart of the construction season and a lot of our activity here is driven by institutional activities that go on, on college campuses and schools, so I feel positive about that. We were out at the ISC West show, that was the best vibe that I've got at a tradeshow in the last 5 years. So no factual view on April, but we continue to be positive on the direction of the business. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Excellent. And then if I can just squeeze one more in. Obviously, a lot of price support in the Americas segment from what you've had to do in Venezuela. Can you give us a sense of what that would maybe look like, ex Venezuela, more the U.S. business? Patrick Shannon : Yes, you're exactly right. A lot of that increase there was related to Venezuela. We're offsetting the inflation in the market. We were successful, by the way, in doing that. If you look at the price increase for Americas, it's really carryover from the prior year, and I would call it around 0.5% or 1% would be the realization year-over-year and that stepping up a little bit in the back half of the year. Operator : Our next question is from Charles Clarke of Credit Suisse. Charles Clarke : Just a question. I think at the Analyst Day, we talked about Europe kind of flattish market for the year, Asia up kind of high-single digits. First quarter just kind of looked a little bit the opposite, kind of Asia kind of slow growth in the beginning and Europe kind of showing some nice growth with revenues up 4% or so. So just as a question, I think relative to then, is there this visibility in the Asia business? Or is that a little weaker? Or does Europe feel a little bit stronger? David Petratis : A couple drivers in Asia in Q1, the Chinese New Year takes a lot of wind out of our sails. I felt positive about activity coming out of South Asia. Our mechanical business had some decent traction. If we look at the historical trends on Asia-Pac, this is clearly -- we build momentum as we go through the year, and we'll see that. Our Bocom business that we talked about at Analyst Day tends to be more project-driven, and those projects gain momentum as we go through the year. Europe, I -- we label it as stabilization, but I was, again, energized. We're seeing some light in the markets that we participate, and I'm really pleased with Lucia Moretti's aggressiveness in the first month. The actions that we're taking, I think, are sending a strong message to our team and our customers that we're going to be focused on where we can win. And we will make investments and productivity improvements to complement that. So it's still -- we're a long way from recovery in Europe, in terms of the overall economic, and I think we have a little bigger challenge with our Southern European exposure, but we're going to focus on those opportunities and execute. Patrick Shannon : Yes, and Charles, I would just add, in terms of the revenue growth that you see year-over-year in Europe, the majority of that on a reported basis was exchange related in the strength in the euro and the British pound relative to the dollar. If you exclude that, it was basically flat year-over-year. Charles Clarke : Okay. And just one housekeeping question, just because most of my other stuff's been answered. Interest expense just looked a little high to me in the first quarter just looking at what I was expecting. Is 13 a good run rate going forward? Patrick Shannon : Yes, 13 is a good run rate. People sometimes forget some of the debt issuance cost that are amortized over the life of the debt, and that's the other component that's working in there. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Steven Winoker : Just first, few clarification questions on Venezuela. And I know it's only 3% of sales, but still want to try to understand this. The pricing actions you took, were they just enough to offset the official exchange rate that you are talking about, or a little bit more? Should we think about that as something that is actually capable of covering some of those other potential outcomes that are described in the Q? Patrick Shannon : Yes. So the pricing action, predominantly, was taken to offset the inflationary pressures that we're seeing in the market there. The -- it's not really tied to the exchange rate per se. But in the event there was or will be a devaluation, we do believe we could perhaps be a little bit more aggressive in the pricing front to offset some of that impact on a going-forward basis relative to the translation of those results. Steven Winoker : So you didn't get ahead of that? That's something that would be on -- to come? Patrick Shannon : That's correct. Steven Winoker : Okay. And then in the event that the risk that you called out in the Q were to play out at those -- at other devaluation levels, just so we understand it, would there be 2 effects here between an asset write-down and a translation effect, or just 1 that you called out? Patrick Shannon : Yes, so there's a nonrecurring charge and those numbers are reported in the 10-Q at both the Sicad I and Sicad II rate. But there would also be an ongoing impact on the translation of those results back to U.S. dollars. Steven Winoker : And you did not explicitly call that out, as I recall, right? Patrick Shannon : No, because again, we're not going to be sitting on our hands doing nothing. We would help mitigate that with what we just discussed in terms of pricing actions and those type of things. Steven Winoker : Okay, great. On Asia Pacific, you talk about, I guess a sequential improvement, but year-on-year, I guess it was down 2.5%, I was -- your margins Q2 of 2013 were minus 2.5%. So even if -- and it was minus 5% right before that, and given the minus 13.5% -- 13% adjusted now, even a slight improvement could still mean a significant -- significantly lower than the prior year. Is that what we should be thinking about? Or what kind incremental -- how should we be thinking about that for Q2? Patrick Shannon : No, not really. The comparisons do get easier beginning in Q2. As we kind of laid out, this is an unusual business where roughly 1/3 of the revenues in the first half of the year, 2/3 in the second half of the year, we don't have a lot of variable cost structure in this business. But relative to what we're seeing in the marketplace, we would expect the margins to be somewhat close to last year in Q2 and then really starting to expand in the back half of the year. Steven Winoker : Okay. And then just one last one. On productivity, you called out $0.08 for the quarter. Does that include the volume leverage on the 3.5% growth, ex pricing, I guess? And regardless, where are you getting -- maybe a little more color on where you're getting that? How much of that is in the Americas? Patrick Shannon : So we're seeing productivity improvements throughout the globe. We are seeing it primarily through many things, but the value stream analysis that continues in our operations, the VAVE work that's being done by the engineering group, we're getting really good traction with that. So we're also seeing the benefits of the improvement in the margins in Europe associated with the 2013 restructuring activities. So that's lumped in there in terms of productivity benefits. And all of that is exceeding both our material, as well as labor inflation. Operator : [Operator Instructions]  Our next question comes from Jeremie Capron of CLSA. Jeremie Capron : A question on volume. If I look at your EPS walk on Slide #6, do I understand correctly that essentially volumes were flat year-over-year? Patrick Shannon : Yes. So up slightly, a lot of the movement in revenue was driven from price. Jeremie Capron : Okay. And then you mentioned a few times that the electronics business obviously, was seeing positive growth. I wonder if you could give us a sense of that growth rate for the electronics and obviously, the mechanical business must be down then year-over-year? Patrick Shannon : So our Electronics business growing at low double digits, we believe we've got a nice market-leading position there. And with our new products, we're going to continue to look at the opportunities to enhance that globally. Jeremie Capron : Okay. And on pricing, are you seeing any change in terms of the pricing environment, be it in North America or Europe? Patrick Shannon : I would say it's steady. We're in competitive markets, but the market appears to be disciplined. Typically, we're competing on advantages in our product portfolio that allow us to be rewarded for the quality and engineering that we're putting in our product. Jeremie Capron : Okay. So and then a final one for me. Can you give us a sense of the size of the acquisitions that you've announced so far this year in terms of the revenue contribution we could expect in 2014? Patrick Shannon : We have not disclosed that. They're -- collectively they're smaller transactions, each one kind of the 10 to lower-type of revenue numbers. So not a significant impact on a full-year basis. Operator : Our next question is from Steve [indiscernible] of Gates Capital Management. Unknown Analyst : I'm just curious what the potential restructuring cost estimate will be for EMEIA and over what time period? Patrick Shannon : Yes, so we would be looking to move forward in booking a charge. Most of that would be in Q2, and still working on the number. What we've kind of indicated in terms of our spent and restructuring cost, $0.25 to $0.30 per share. So the restructuring would be included in that, but not a significant charge. Operator : Our next question is a follow from Josh Pokrzywinski of MKM partners. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Just a couple of quick follow-ups here. First, on the tax rate, you guys look like you're running a little bit ahead of the 31%, and I would imagine there's still some levers to pull as we move through the year. Any sense of timing as when you'll have the critical mass or have the pipeline of action to give us an update on that? Patrick Shannon : Yes, I would just say nothing has really changed today from our last guidance, which you may recall, that we're looking to move our effective tax rate currently at 31% down to the mid-20's in the next couple of years. As we look at the land landscape of opportunities, I'm getting better clarity in terms of what those opportunities are. There's still lot of work to be done, too early, obviously, to declare victory. But I'm feeling pretty good in terms of the opportunities. As we continue to work on those, we'll provide more clarity as we go forward in terms of timing, magnitude, et cetera. David Petratis : I would add, in terms of Patrick and I and leadership of the business, this would be one of the key priorities for us. And we -- Patrick in particular, Shelly Metter [ph], have dedicated significant time, and we got our eye on it. And we'll continue to make sure that we've got a competitive tax rate. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Great. And then just on the spec and quote comments that you made, being up in the, I think you said mid-teens, and that tends to be a 9-month-plus forward indicator, any change in cadence as that moves through 2013 that could signal an inflection in 2014 that we should be aware of? Or was that just kind of a steady grind last year? Patrick Shannon : In terms of quotes? Joshua Pokrzywinski : Yes, the -- you mentioned the spec and quote as a forward indicator so I'm trying to use it, I guess, as the -- a forward indicator more near term. David Petratis : I would use of that as a positive view on our survey of the landscape that we continue to go through a recovery. It's going to be gradual. This is not a bounce back, but I like the indicators. We're sharply focused on the markets where we see there is opportunity. I think there is also areas of the geographical landscape that we could do a better job of getting our share or better. And we're investing to go after that, we are drilling down deeply to understand the market segment opportunities where we're performing well. And if there's gaps, what do we have to do to fill that. And I like our opportunity there. In a softer market, if it gets stronger, we're going to do even better. Joshua Pokrzywinski : And could you just remind us what percentage of that commercial business, or I guess nonresidential business in the Americas is keyed off of some of those early indicators on spec and quotation activity? David Petratis : I would say 60% of our business is heavily driven by spec writers and quotation activity. These are projects, these are construction retrofits, and it's a clear driver. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got you. So that comment is a pretty decent analog for your visibility into next year at this point? David Petratis : I like what I see, and I think that's been a consistent message over the last 6 months. Operator : Our next question is a follow-up from Jeff Kessler of Imperial Capital. Jeffrey Kessler : I just basically want to get some clarification on what you just -- you said a little bit earlier about Europe and the way Europe looked in the first quarter and that the gains came -- the margin gains, but that the revenue gains in -- specifically, were mainly related to ForEx and not actually the unit volume. Am I mistaken in hearing that? Patrick Shannon : No, that's correct. Operator : I'm showing no further questions at this time. I like to turn the conference back over to Tom Martineau for closing remarks. Tom Martineau : All right, then. We'd like to thank everybody for joining today's call. Have a safe day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

Dave Petratis : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In the second quarter, revenues were $531 million, up 4% on an adjusted basis versus last year and up 2.9% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $101.7 million increased 1.6% versus the prior year and adjusted operating margin of 19.1% was down 50 basis points versus the prior year. Accounting for a $2.5 million bad debt adjustment in the Asia-Pacific region, adjusted operating margin was flat to prior year. We delivered reporting earnings per share of $0.53, which includes an $0.08 of restructuring and one-time separation cost resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.61. Organic adjusted revenue in the Americas grew 4.9%, driven by continued strength in our Residential segment. Slightly negative EMEIA revenue growth was consistent with our expectations regarding flat, but stable markets and our decision to exit certain product markets that are less profitable, dilute resources and are not scalable. Although bookings are strong in our China system integration business, the timing of large government related contracts were the main driver in negative 12% revenue growth year-over-year. Allegion repurchased approximately 600,000 shares for $30.3 million in the quarter. This is consistent with our previously communicated capital allocation strategy to offset dilution. We are raising the mid-point of our full-year EPS guidance, which is now forecasted to be $2.30 to $2.40 on an adjusted basis and $2.00 to $2.15 on a reported basis. This earnings forecast assumes adjusted revenue growth of 3.5% to 4.5%, similar to her previous guidance. Please go to Slide 4. We continue to prioritize investments to meet the electromechanical transformation within the security industry. Our ability to provide new solutions that offer innovation and convenience to both, our residential and commercial customers is a pillar of our growth platform. We continue to make progress in Europe. As part of our profitability improvement actions, we announced an agreement to divest our U.K. Door business to an affiliate of Alcyon Financial Limited, a financial investment firm. The businesses to be sold include the Dor-o-Matic branded automatic door businesses, the Martin Roberts, branded performance steel doorset business and the U.K. service organization. This enables us to simplify our portfolio and focus on the key strategic businesses and services within the EMEIA region. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees within these businesses for their contributions and continued focus on the customer during this transition and wish them well in the Alcyon family. Also in the second quarter, we have committed to a plan to restructure the EMEIA organization to improve efficiencies, cost structure and position future growth. We remain focused on acquisition opportunities in emerging markets, emerging technologies and product portfolio expansion. We continue to work to develop our M&A pipeline and are seeing the favorable results of our early acquisitions. As we evaluate future opportunities, we will continue to follow a disciplined process to make sure the deals are aligned with our strategy and that we have confidence that they will create shareholder value. Before I move on, I would like to take a moment to provide a status on our transition service agreements. We have eliminated over 75% of the TSAs with Ingersoll-Rand, and we remain confident of migrating up all service agreement by the end of the year. This has been made possible by the significant efforts of hundreds of Allegion employees around the globe. Please go to Slide 5. Last quarter, I spoke to you about our innovation pipeline and advancements with regard to technology development. This quarter I would like to share some recent examples. Our Schlage Touchscreen deadbolt with alarm was ranked number one in electronic-connected locks in June from a leading consumer publication and our Schlage keypad deadbolt was ranked number one in electronic locks. We are the category pioneer in residential electronic lock category and launched the first connected smart lock to the market. Our connected Touchscreen deadbolt solutions offers best-in-quality durability, best-in-class security and the convenience of fast and easy installation with sleek designs and style great for today's home renovations. Our opened platform lock is [home] renovations. Opened platform lock is compatible with leading home automation in monitored security systems and with Grade 1 security rating building alarm technology and fingerprint resistant touchscreens we are leading the evolution to the keyless era. We recently announced our new wireless lock with a gauge technology used for commercial applications, designed to be the easiest electronic to install, connect, manage and use, this new product reduces the owners' cost of ownership and we believe will accelerate the adoption rate of electronic locks in the commercial market. It offers the same Schlage quality and durability commercial business owners have come to rely on, plus it comes with web and mobile app tools to help building owners manage access. It's ideal for interior office doors, common area doors and sensitive storage areas. You have heard me discuss the complexity of our industry, including navigating the requirements of codes and standards. A great example of this is our new Von Duprin AX series exit device. Developed to provide the market with a solution that needs recent California building code enhancements that established the 5 pounds minimum force on operational hardware for accessible openings. Our AX product provides the first UL-certified exit device meeting the new requirements, while incorporating the rigorous standards for durability, use and functionality that are synonymous with Von Duprin. Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I will be back to update you on our full 2014 outlook. Patrick Shannon : Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Please go to Slide number 6. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $531.5 million, reflecting an increase of 0.5% versus the prior year. Adjusting prior periods for a previously discussed order flow change with our consolidated joint venture in Asia net revenues increased 4% versus the prior year. Organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of our recent acquisitions and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, was up 2.9%. We realized mid-double-digit growth in residential Americas, driven by the builder, e-commerce and Venezuela segments. The Commercial business had modest growth, reflecting continued softness in institutional markets. EMEIA revenues were consistent with our expectations regarding flat, but stable markets. Although bookings were strong in our China system integration business, the nature of the timing of large government-related contracts drove a large variance in the quarterly growth rate. Adjusted operating income increased by 1.6% compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margins were 19.1% in the quarter. The results include a $2.5 million bad debt adjustment within the Asia-Pacific region. Excluding this item, operating margin was flat compared to the prior year period. The company continues to invest in future growth platforms, including incremental engineering to accelerate new product development as Dave highlighted earlier and incremental channel development expenditures to accelerate growth in underserved vertical markets. Please go to Slide number 7. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter of 2013, reported and adjusted EPS was $0.64, operational results increased EPS by $0.04 as pricing and productivity more than offset inflation. Note that pricing actions were taken in the quarter to offset increased inflation, particularly in Venezuela. The operational results also include an unfavorable $0.02 per share impact related to the bad debt that adjustment from the Asia-Pacific region. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate to 29.8% drove $0.06 per share improvement versus the prior year. The decrease in our effective tax rate is due to favorable changes in the mix, a pre=tax income and continued leverage of our tax structure. The next slide reflects the reduction of $0.08 per share related to the incremental interest expense incurred as a result of additional indebtedness associated with the spinoff from Ingersoll-Rand. Next, incremental investments in ongoing growth initiatives were a $0.03 reduction, increased non-controlling and a higher number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding, each represented a $0.01 reduction in EPS. This results in adjusted second quarter 2014 EPS of $0.61 per share. Continuing on, we have an $0.08 per share reduction for restructuring and spin related expenses to arrive at the second quarter 2014 reported EPS of $0.53. The reduction is driven by one-time separation cost in the quarter of $6.9 million, as well as EMEIA restructuring and other charges of $5.1 million. Please go to Slide number 8. Second quarter revenues for the Americas region were up 5.3% on an adjusted basis and up 4.9% on an organic basis. Removing the impact of Venezuelan price increases, revenues were up 2.4% on an adjusted basis. Venezuela pricing, higher volumes and the acquisition of Schlage to Columbia in January 2014, offset unfavorable currency movement in Canada. North America residential revenue growth reflected strength in the builder and e-commerce channels. In addition, we continue to see strong growth in residential electronic locks as this category increased over 20% compared to the prior period. Commercial organic revenues were up slightly in the quarter as commercial verticals compensated for weak institutional markets. Adjusted operating margins for the quarter were down 140 basis points. The decrease was primarily attributable to incremental investments and unfavorable business mix related to the higher growth of residential revenue compared to commercial revenue. These headwinds were partially offset by favorable pricing and productivity. We continue to see improved year-over-year residential margins, which partially offset the unfavorable business mix. Although operating margins declined in the quarter, we are still projecting margin improvement for the full-year as a result of higher volumes, improved pricing and to some extent an easier comparison in the fourth quarter. Please go to Slide number 9. We are pleased with the ongoing progress in EMEIA as reflected in the second quarter results. As we discuss our operational performance, please keep in mind, our U.K. Door business have been removed to discontinued operations in the financial results. The combined businesses had revenue of approximately $24 million and an operating loss of approximately $3 million for 2013. Second quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were up 3% and down 0.3% on an organic basis. Market indicators continue to suggest stability in the southern region, but with minimal growth. The organic revenue decline was driven by lower volume reflecting actions to selectively exit unprofitable markets, partially offset by price improvements. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 2%, up 320 basis points compared to the prior year period. The favorable improvement is driven by price and carryover 2013 restructuring benefits as well as management's initiatives to exit certain unprofitable market segments. We remain on target to reflect a 300-basis point improvement in operating margin for the full year. The restructuring actions taken in the quarter will further lean out the cost structure with benefits realized the second half of 2014. Please go to Slide number 10. Second quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were down 9.2% and down 12% on an organic basis. Declines in system integration revenue were partially offset by strong double-digit hardware growth in most regions. Our system integration revenue is dependent on large government contracts that can have large quarterly variations in the timing of project awards. When evaluating the performance of his business, we monitor full year growth as the best indicator of success. We exited the second quarter with a higher backlog and strong project pipeline and are still expecting high single-digit growth of the full-year. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was down $2.5 million, driven by one-time bad debt adjustment of the same amount in the current quarter. Excluding this impact, operating margins would have been in line with prior year's favorable pricing, productivity and the FSH acquisition offset the system integration volume decline in investments. We continue to expect operating margins to improve for the full-year as revenue increases with the seasonality of the business. Please go to Slide number 11. Turning our attention to available cash flow, you'll see that we generated $39.4 million of available cash flow year-to-date. The decrease in available cash versus 2013 reflects spend in restructuring expenses and incremental capital expenditures for new systems, new product development and productivity investments. We continue to manage our working capital effectively in order to improve the velocity of asset turnover, resulting in improvements in working capital as a percentage of sales as well as reduction in our cash conversion cycle. We are still targeting available cash flow for the year to approximate 100% of net earnings from continuing operations. I will now hand it back over Dave for an update of our full year 2014 guidance. Dave Petratis : Thanks, Patrick. Please go to Slide 12. If we turn our attention to end markets in the Americas, we see a shift in growth between residential and non-residential markets as compared to our prior guidance. The non-residential markets will continue to recover at a slower pace. Availability and cost of labor continues to be a challenge and any weather-related carryover from the prior quarter appears to have been modest. We now forecast non-residential 2014 growth in the low-single digits, mostly driven by the commercial segments of the market. We expect the institutional market to be flat to negative low-single digits for the year. When we look at the ABI Index, a long-term indicator for Allegion, we know the institutional sector for ABI has been recovering at a much slower pace than the commercial sectors. June marked the first time the institutional index has reach positive territory since August 2013. We see the growth in traditional commercial segments such as retail, office and hospitality as opportunities to redirect efforts to drive more share of discretionary business coming through those channels. This remains a critical component in our ability to expand in our core markets. The residential multi-family segment continued its strong pace of growth driven by affordability, mobility and uncertainty of the job market. Although we are still below normal levels, the single-family residential markets continue to show solid improvement, driven by continued recovery in single-family construction. As housing prices continued to increase and inventories reduced, we see increases in renovation activity, which will drive demand in our retail channels. With our residential product portfolio of new innovative products, we are well-positioned to support stronger residential renovation activity. Our outlook for European 2014 growth remains subdued and we continue to forecast at Allegion served markets to be flat. For instance in the construction markets, two of Allegion larger mechanical markets are forecast to be slightly negative for the year. The ongoing recovery in this market will proceed at a very slow rate and we still view recovery to normal levels to occur after 2015. We expect mid-single digit growth in the Asia-Pacific region, driven by growth in China. Of note, we're seeing pressure in China, in the Residential segment, with increased inventory and reduced home values, while non-residential construction growth remained strong. We also see annual growth in the System Integration segment as safe city investments in China continued the shift from first tier to second and third tier cities. Please go to Slide 13. Our full-year adjusted year-over-year revenue forecast remains up 3.5% to 4.5%. We continue to expect the Americas revenues to be up 3.5% to 5% in aggregate although the mix of the revenues had shifted when compared to previous guidance. Essentially strong residential volumes are compensating for lower than expected institutional volumes. We see the EMEIA region as essentially flat and Asia-Pacific region to be up 8% to 10% with a strong second half. Please go to Slide 14. We are raising the mid-point of our 2014 EPS guidance. Adjusted earnings per share are now forecasted to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.40, an increase of 6% to 11% from 2013 adjusted earnings per share. We continue to anticipate earnings growth will accelerate in the second half of this year due to higher volumes, 2014 European actions and a wider spread in the effective tax rate. Restructuring and spin costs are still expected to be $0.25 to $0.30 of impact during the year, resulting in a reported EPS range of $2.00 to $2.15. The effective tax rate assumptions in the guidance is approximately 30% and outstanding diluted shares are approximately 97 million. Finally, the guidance does not reflect the potential risk of the devaluation of the Venezuela Bolivar. For more information on this topic, please refer to our Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the period ended June 30, 2014. Please go to Slide 15. To summarize, we are pleased with the results in the quarter given the soft institutional and Southern European market environments. The American Residential segment continues to perform well and we are taking the pricing actions in Venezuela to compensate for inflation. We have a solid backlog of system integration projects in China, and expect to see stronger second half within that business. As evident in the quarter, we continued to make significant progress on our European profitability actions. Our 2014 priorities are clear. We continue to execute on our operating strategies to assist us in the company for accelerated growth, drive a balanced capital location plan and complete spin-related activities quickly and efficiently. Now, Patrick and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Thanks very much and good morning. Patrick Shannon :  Good morning, Steven Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Nice progress as a team and all the key initiatives that you have been talking about, but one thing it would just be helpful especially is - our net working capital reduction, again, Patrick could you just call out exactly how you are getting that? Patrick Shannon : Yes. It's coming primarily from improved focus on both receivable and inventory turnover. I think, we have talked about historically, if you looked at the businesses from a regional perspective, Americas has been in pretty good shape. The opportunity was really in the European area. The other team has done a nice job in reducing our inventory there. Continued vigilance and receivable management and just really seeing good progress across the board. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. You expect that to continue then going forward? Patrick Shannon :  Well, you know, if you kind a look at it over the last four quarters, we have continuously made good progress in that area both, in terms of working capital as a percentage of revenue as well as our cash conversion cycle. I think there were some additional opportunities here, but at some point you know it becomes limited in terms of the step improvement, but we will continue to remain focused on it to drive improvement. If you benchmark the business, it shows up extremely well. It will be a high priority for us as we run Allegion. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. Great. Then on the Americas, just digging into that a little bit for now, the 3% pricing growth you called out the Latin American actions being taken, but was the U.S. also getting priced or is this all Latin America and price was maybe other way in the U.S.? Patrick Shannon : Yes. The majority was Venezuela price-related. It's a high inflation economy as you know and team has done a really good job to offset the inflation there both, in terms of material as well as salaries and those [narrow] both, in terms of material as well as salaries and those types of things there. I would say about 80% is relative to Venezuela. The majority in both, our residential and the rest of it in our residential, commercial, area, so we are getting some pricing improvement. You may recall last quarter we instituted the price increase effective at the beginning of April. It took some time to kind of work out the backlog, but we are starting to see some incremental price now going into the Q3. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : You are not seeing additional pricing related competition in the U.S. That's abnormal? Patrick Shannon :  I wouldn't say it's abnormal. It's always a competitive market, but we are getting, I think, our share of price here. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. Just on Venezuela point, again. I am not sure I am clear. What would it actually take to trigger an accounting change, the change to those other rates given you have described it very fully in your prior calls how it's a closed loop and all of that. I mean, what would actually have to happen next externally or what should we look for that would give us a sign that you would actually have the force to take that action. Patrick Shannon : Yes. Right now, when we looked at that, I think patience is prudent you know there's a lot of potential movement there in the currency, but the triggering event obviously would be a change in the official exchange rate. We would be forced to that point in time to adapt to the new rate, but if our intent or our business strategy changes to the extent we need to go out and exchange local currency to U.S. dollars that would be a triggering event. We talked about previously that if you look at that business it is fairly well self-contained i.e. it sources the product manufacturers distributes in-country. We don't really have a need or nor do we have a desire today to exchange local currency to dollars, so that's why we are sitting on the fence now and we will wait and see you know how this shakes out. I think, we'll all agree at some point there is going to be a devaluation here. This is the question of when is kind of my perspective on that. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. Patrick Shannon : All right, I will pass it on. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kessler, Imperial Capital. Your line is open. Jeff Kessler - Imperial Capital : Thinking of the Americas, I am wondering if you could describe the margin differential between commercial and institutional and any government business that you might have as the mix of those, let's say micro-segments changes, how does that affect you? Patrick Shannon : Yes. Jeff, so, you know, we don't really look at it in terms of specific mix within the vertical markets. You know what we are looking at, obviously, is how the total commercial business is performing. You know relative to residential, I mean, there was a mix change there as the residential volumes were higher proportionate to commercial, but the good news story there is the residential margins are improving. We are getting good throughput in the factory, good productivity there, so that's helping mitigate the mix change. Jeff Kessler - Imperial Capital : That was my next question. I mean, it was surprising that given all the emphasis to put on the residential versus commercial mix, with residential having lower margin you have been able to maintain the margin up there. The other question that I had was, again, regarding Europe. I guess, is there any change in the timing of 2015 into 2016, where you want to end up at a margin. What is the processor you are going through to get to a, well it a 10% type of margin in Europe. What is the process and timing of that process? Patrick Shannon : We have made the big moves with our pruning. You see that in terms of the exit of our U.K. Door businesses. The second step was our internal structural cost. We have tried to move our resources much closer to our markets. The third is really getting enemies five or six markets that I see are strong in our mechanical businesses, in raising the performance and face time of our spec-writers and working with our channel partners to get more of our share in a flat market. The other side of this is the Interflex business, which we were in the search to appoint an entrepreneurial leader there. That business is performing well and understanding the growth opportunities we have got within that space, so that's how I would kind of frame it. I was really pleased with the actions that we have taken to get it to this point. I thought the improvement in margins year-over-year for the quarter were outstanding and we are going to continue to work that to reach the aspirations that we see. Jeff Kessler - Imperial Capital : Okay. Just follow-up question, those new Schlage electronic locks, you granted they may be under a different brand name, but are they applicable to the European market or is the European market, let's say, is it resistant to this point to residential wireless electronic locks or is it just going to be three or four years behind just by the normal course of things? Patrick Shannon : We believe the technology is applicable. I think it's one of the challenges of the new Allegion to think about how we can leverage our technology globally. We are looking at that capability in Europe as well as Asia to be able extend it and we think we have got good opportunities to go there, but work to be done. Jeff Kessler - Imperial Capital : All right. Great. Thank you very much. Patrick Shannon : Thanks, Jeff. Good to hear from you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Kepron from CLSA. Your line is open. Jeremy Kepron - CLSA:  Hi. Good morning everybody. Question on the margins in the Americas segment, you called it the shifting and the mix here really weighing on the margin. I am wondering if this purely a function of strength in the residential and weaker non-res products. You also called that 20%-plus growth in electronic locks and I am wondering how that would affect margins in a positive way? Patrick Shannon : Yes, so I would say that, if you looked at the revenue, the top-line, the majority of the volume growth was residential related continue to see strong end market growth there, so that was the primary driver, just the mix. The residential margins as you know are lower than the commercial, revenue margins, so that was the driver there. In terms of electronic locks, it's a good trend for us. We are the category leader in residential electronic locks. We saw good growth there plus-20%. If you think about the margin perspective, I would say equal to maybe slightly better than mechanical traditional locks, but with a much higher price point, so not only are we getting higher margin, but were getting incremental ally dollars as well, because of the higher price point, so that's a good mix shift for us and we see that given our leading position, technology, connectivity we see that growing in the future. Dave Petratis : I would just add in that Residential segment, the ResPro, which is new construction in our residential activity is very price-competitive, especially in today's market. As we can take e-locks on the residential side, in the retrofit market and move that up, we are going to do better. The second thing that's improving our margins, remember, a year-and-a-half ago, we moved production capability from IR [Fu Hsing] a joint venture to our Baja facilities that team is doing an excellent job of leaning out that capability and it's having a positive effect on our margins. Jeremy Kepron - CLSA:  Understood. Okay. Then looking at the cash flow statement just two things here, one is the step up in CapEx. I think $26 million year-to-date. It's a little bit ahead of what I had in mind. Could you maybe remind us of what the percentage for this year and next? Patrick Shannon : Yes. Sure. This year, our CapEx plan is to be around $40 million for the year, so the first half is a little bit higher. That was really done purposely. We had some systems related expenditure to get off of our transitional services agreements, particular [HRMS] systems, so we had anticipated to be front-end loaded, but we are planning on $40 million for the year. As we look into next year, I would anticipate the CapEx to kind of stay around that level close to 2% of revenue. Jeremy Kepron - CLSA:  Okay. Great. Question for Dave regarding the restructuring plan in Europe, so I think you laid out the plan, those three steps, but I am wondering if you also have an idea that what be the ideal manufacturing footprint in Europe and would that be a further step in the restructuring plan? Dave Petratis : We continue to challenge our manufacturing footprint globally. We certainly hypothesize around what the opportunities are in Europe. We pruning what we did in U.K. was the nice first step. It's always a challenge to restructure in Europe. We think there are opportunities there, but we are also mindful, we need to be close to our end customer, so we are working those alternatives in mind that, how we properly position the business to be successful. Jeremy Kepron - CLSA:  Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charles Clarke of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Charles Clarke - Credit Suisse : Hey, guys. Patrick Shannon : Hi, Charles. Charles Clarke - Credit Suisse : I guess, first question just on tax. I realize that you guys lowered the rate to 30% from 31%, probably being nitpicky here, but is that a function of ongoing internal efforts, or is that more related to mix? Dave Petratis : More related to mix, a couple things we are able to do there from a strategy perspective to have an impact on that. You know, this is an area that obviously continues to heightened focus. It is a strategic asset of the business and we want to continue to leverage this. We have engaged external advisors to help us in this area. The more we look into this, I think, the more we like in terms of potential opportunity. There is a lot of work to be done, so right now our guidance hasn't changed in terms of our tax rate and what we anticipate to reduce it to kind of the mid-20s by 2016. Charles Clarke - Credit Suisse : Great. Thanks. Then just looking at Americas specifically, just looking at the first half of this year compared to the first half of last year just on an adjusted operating profit line, looks like margins were down about 50 basis points. Just wondering if you think in the back half that we should expect Americas' margins to be higher year-over-year just given that blip with the Venezuela pricing that probably won't repeat. Dave Petratis : Yes. Absolutely. We are still forecasting and projecting full-year margins to be up year-over-year, so consequently the second half margins would be a stronger to mitigate for the first half shortfall there and that's primarily a couple of things. We are looking at strong growth, a better mix in the commercial markets. We are anticipating improved pricing. We have some price increases that went into effect and we are starting to see that come through in our order book and getting good leverage on the incremental volumes as well as you may remember fourth quarter last year had a little noise in it, so the comparisons get a little bit easier in Q4 and that will help us as well for the full-year margin comparisons. Charles Clarke - Credit Suisse : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Dave Petratis : Hi, Jeff. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : Hi. Good morning. A couple things, I know you didn't want to really get into the margin difference within commercial, commercial versus institutional, but I wonder if you could speak to the kind of product intensity difference, you know, kind of value per square foot or anything like that where you have been able to kind of size the difference, so I would assume your value intensity is much higher on institutional. Just wondering how much lower commercial might be. Dave Petratis : Institutional versus commercial? Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : Yes. Dave Petratis : I have not done the value intensity analysis. It's a good challenge to get to. I would describe it this way that the margins are not significantly lower. What has driven the success of the company in the institutional side is a built-to-order model and our opportunity lies in what I called through stock distributor business, inventory in the shelf, so that we first focus on what I would call the retrofit market, let's say 10-office doors in New York City. We are doing some test cases and see opportunity to do that. There could be a bit less margin, but I don't think it's significant. We are challenging ourselves and our U.S. the Americas team that there's significant opportunity in this retrofit fast-moving market and how can we do that with our leading brands as well as our price siding brands and growth in that space? Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : I was also just wondering on Europe with the U.K. move, is there a substantial amount of, call it, addition by subtraction that could happen as you right size that portfolio. Is there more revenue that comes up through divestiture? Dave Petratis : I believe we are done. I think it's now continuing to optimize the structure and really working the channel relationships, driving more specification capabilities in front-end of the business. We have lost some of that capability over last five years and that's how you win. We are looking at our opportunities with Interflex. That's been a good engine for us and you think in the bigger world of connected security, the Internet of things, we think there is good opportunity there, so I would say we are done at least for now. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : Then just more for me, just the bad debt expense in Asia, where was that? What was it? Was it distributor, a retailer or project that you completed that you didn't get paid on? Can you give us a little more color there? Is there anything else there we ought to be mindful of? Dave Petratis : Yes. Jeff, it's primarily related to our system integration business there, which as you know has long tails to the contracts and no payouts from customers accordingly. You know, unfortunately, we had a change in some of the payment history from a couple of primary customers. I would say, this is not a systemic problem. We did a comprehensive review of both, our receivable portfolio as well as the unbilled receivables and reserve there what you see was kind of a fallout of that comprehensive review. You never want to have these things, but I think we addressed it properly and hopefully we have got it behind us now. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David [MacGregor] of Longbow Research. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst :  Yes. Good morning. I guess, the question is with respect to your ability to flex your operational excellence programs. Specifically, the second half top-line growth in U.S. commercial and institutional is below your expectations. To what extent do you the ability to accelerate your cost reduction and value stream initiatives to protect the margins? I think this businesses been modeled and built on its ability to flex up and flex down. I would be critical of our performance in the first half that we anticipated it being the touch stronger and maybe stood at readiness, so we have got our eyes focused that if things don't materialize, we will flex down faster. Unidentified Analyst :  Okay. I guess, second question is just with regard to the mix. If you could talk specifically with regard to the Americas, what kind of growth you saw in your opening price point brands versus your premium brands? Dave Petratis : I would say generally disappointed in the opening price point brands. I think that's reflective the replacement market, the retrofit market. There is part of a channel that we are not as well positioned in. Jeff Kessler asked the question about the [true stock]. I can name several industries where the actual true stock business carries a higher margin. Our challenge is to position ourselves in the channel to enjoy a bigger part of that space. Unidentified Analyst :  Thank you very much. Operator : We have a follow-up question from the line of Jeremy Kepron of CLSA. Your line is open. Jeremy Kepron - CLSA: Yes. Thank you. Just a follow-up on Jeff's question regarding the Asia-Pacific business and system integration projects over there. Could you tell us a little more about those projects that you expect to come through in the second half and precisely the nature of them. Thank you. Dave Petratis : You may remember from Analyst Day, we gave an overview. These are typically seven-figure projects, our backlog of those projects are up 20%. This would be providing higher definition cameras in the Pudong airport. These are safe city projects, where we are pulling together systems, a video, car counting, vehicle recognition. If you look at the Bocom business over the last five years, it tends to be second half-loaded, so normal from our perspective. We think our ability to execute on that is right. We are trying to drive more of our operational excellence initiatives to make sure we apply the same techniques on this more service-oriented capability as we do in our manufacturing capabilities, so we feel good about our ability to bring that moment in second half. Jeremy Kepron - CLSA: All right. Thank you. Operator : I am not showing any further questions in the queue at this time. I would like to turn the call back to you, Tom, for closing remarks. Tom Martineau : Okay. We will wrap it up. We would like to thank everyone for joining us today and have a safe day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does concludes the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Tom Martineau, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Tom Martineau : Thank you, Amanda and good morning. Welcome and thank for joining us for the third quarter 2014 Allegion earnings call. With me today is Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release which was issued last night after market close and the presentation, which we will refer to in today\u2019s call, are available on our website www.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website. Please go to slide two. Statements made in today\u2019s call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities law. Please see our SEC filings for description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Our release and today\u2019s commentary includes non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release and the 2013 quarterly information in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation for further details. With that, please go to slide three, and I will turn the call over to Dave. Dave Petratis : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased with the performance of Allegion in the third quarter. Our team delivered solid operational leverage with a nice increase in demand. Revenue were 546 million up 6.8% on an adjusted basis versus last year and up 6.4% on an organic basis. The American region led the way with 8.5% organic growth with increases in non-residential, residential and Latin American segments. Adjusting operating income of 110 million increased 15.4% versus last year, all regions contributed margin improvement resulting in an increase of adjusted operating margin of 150 basis points for the company. We delivered reporting earnings per share of $0.64 which includes $0.04 of restructuring and one-time separation cost resulting in an adjusted earnings per share of $0.68. This is an increase of 41.7% versus the prior year. We are increasing our full year EPS guidance which is now forecasted to be $2.37 to $2.42 on an adjusted basis and $2.07 to $2.12 on a reported basis. This earnings forecast assumes adjusted revenue growth of approximately 4.5%. Please go to slide four. We continue to focus on our key growth strategies that create practical solutions and innovative products that meet our customer needs. We\u2019re making great progress in Europe and although we are seeing additional market headwinds, I am pleased with the continued improvement in margin performance. Our focus on key markets improving the portfolio and management of the internal cost structure are continuing to resolve in improved financial results. In the Americas, we began to pilot initiative focused on the commercial repair and renovation segment. Specifically this would be the portion of the market that focus on fast moving quick ship delivery. Historically this has been an underserved market for Allegion consistent with our strategy on core market expansion we will look to position ourselves in the channel to enjoy a bigger part of this large market segment. Capital allocation management continues to be a key element on our measurement of success for the business, Patrick will provide and update on this a little later. Please go to slide five. Allegion continues to lead the way as businesses and residential consumers are increasingly choosing electronic locks and credentials. As we see this convergent across the globe we are now experiencing what we\u2019re calling the keyless era which is all about convenience. Our solutions are redefining the way people connect with and control their homes and offices. We launched our latest advancement engaged technology at the [ASIS] conference in September. ENGAGE technology delivers a new level of security, connectivity and convenience to commercial office buildings and tenant spaces. ENGAGE technology provides a solution that is not only easy install, manage and use but it also affordable. Cloud-based mobile and web app make it easy to manage locks and users from anywhere supporting the growth or changing needs of a business or building. The Schlage NDE wireless lock fits a standard cylindrical door and can be installed in a few minutes with just a screwdriver. ENGAGE technology provides opportunity to expand in underserved markets. We will begin shipping in the US in the fourth quarter and we\u2019ll expand globally in the future. Later this year, we\u2019ll expand our keyless era offerings with several products that continue to redefine the way people enter, exit and connect with their homes. Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I\u2019ll be back to update you on our full year 2014 outlook. Patrick Shannon : Thanks Dave and good morning everyone and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. Please go to slide number six. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $546.7 million reflecting the increase of 3.3% versus the prior year. Adjusting prior periods for a previously discussed order flow change with our consolidated joint venture in Asia, net revenues increased $34.6 million or 6.8% versus the prior year. Organic revenue growth which excludes the impact of our recent acquisitions, the UK door divestiture and foreign exchange rate fluctuations was up 6.4%. We\u2019ve realized high single-digit growth in the Americas with growth in all segments of the market, US commercial and residential segments increased mid-single-digits with Latin America up significantly primarily due to incremental price realization in Venezuela to offset inflation. EMEA revenues were down slightly in the quarter as geopolitical unrest and currency volatility late in the quarter created market headwinds. Asia Pacific revenues were up mid-single-digits driven primarily from an acquisition which occurred in the second quarter. Adjusted operating income of $110.4 million increased 15.4% compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin of 20.2% reflects an increase of 150 basis points versus the prior year reflecting good operating leverage on incremental revenues. We are extremely pleased with the incremental operating leverage of the business particularly as we continue to make incremental growth investments for new products and channel development in order to accelerate our earnings growth and return on capital. Please go to slide number seven. The slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2013 reported EPS was a negative $0.81 adjusting for prior year restructuring a land sale gain and an asset impairment the 2013 adjusted EPS was $0.48, operational results increased EPS by $0.13 as pricing, productivity, and favorable operating leverage more than offset inflation. Note that the pricing actions were taken in the quarter to offset increased inflation particularly in Venezuela. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate to 29% grow $0.21 per share improvement versus the prior year. The decrease in our effective tax rate is primarily due to favorable changes in the mix of pretax income as well as adjustments made in the third quarter of 2013. The next slide reflects the reduction of $0.06 per share related to the incremental interest expense incurred as a result of the additional indebtedness associated with the spin-off (inaudible) ramp. Next, incremental investments and ongoing growth in corporate initiatives tie to our strategy specific to taxes and M&A were a $0.04 reduction. Of note, the volume benefit shown earlier on the reconciliation more than offsets the incremental investment. Increase non-controlling interest and a higher number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding in aggregate represented a $0.04 reduction in EPS. This results in adjusted third quarter 2014 EPS of $0.68 per share. Continuing on, we have a $0.04 per share reduction for restructuring and spin related expenses to arrive at the third quarter 2014 reported EPS of $0.64. Please go to slide number eight. Third quarter revenues for the Americas region were $423.1 million up 9% on an adjusted basis. Removing the impact of Venezuela and price increases revenues were up 5.8% on an adjusted basis. Removing the impact of acquisition and foreign currency, organic revenue was up 8.5%. Higher volumes, Venezuela pricing and the acquisition of Schlage, Colombia in January 2014 offset unfavorable currency movement in Canada. All market segments delivered incremental volume growth, volumes improved in the commercial segment by mid-single digits as we began activities in the US markets to build repair and renovation capability with our channel partners as well as some incremental business ahead of announced price increase effective October 6. US residential growth in the mid-single digits was driven by the strength in the global markets. America\u2019s adjusted operating income of $122.9 million was up 12.2% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 80 basis points due to favorable volume leverage, price and productivity that more than offset inflation and ongoing investments in new product and channel development. Please go to slide number nine. As we review the EMEA results, please keep in mind our UK door businesses have been moved to discontinued operations. Third quarter revenues for the EMEA region were $89.5 million down 2.8% and down 0.9% on an organic basis. Favorable currency movement early in the quarter offset unfavorable September impacts. We anticipate exchange rates will continue to be a headwind in the fourth quarter would note that most of our expenses are also in the region and we\u2019ll minimize the associated margin impact. Markets continue to be soft in the region in most major countries. EMEA adjusted operating income of $1.2 million was up 129% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 1.3% up 570 basis points. Favorable pricing, productivity in excess of inflation and foreign currency exchange movements offset increased investment spending and unfavorable volume leverage. The benefits of previously announced restructuring the region supported the increase in productivity, this quarter represents the fourth quarter in a row in which the region has improved operating margin performance. Year-to-date, adjusted operating profit has improved by $10 million or 350 basis points. Please go to slide number 10. Third quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $34.1 million up 6.9% and up 1.9% on an organic basis. The revenue growth was primarily due to the acquisition of FSH hardware volumes grew in the North Asia, Australia and New Zealand regions lower systematic ration revenues were mostly timing driven as ending Q3 backlog was strong. As announced yesterday, Bocom System won a significant safe city project valued at approximately $25 million. Asia Pacific adjusted operating margin of negative $500,000 was up $400,000 versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved a 130 basis points. The improvement in margin was driven by the FSH acquisition and improved business mix. Please go to slide number 11. We generated a $135 million of available cash flow year-to-date. The decrease in available cash versus 2013 reflects incremental capital expenditures for new product development, information systems and spin related projects. As you can see from the graphs, we continue to demonstrate effective working capital management as well as improvements in our cash convergent cycle. We continue to target available cash flow for the year to approximate 100% of net earnings from continuing operations. Please go to slide number 12. As Dave mentioned earlier, I want to take a moment to reaffirm our commitments to a balanced and flexible capital allocation strategy. We ended Q3 with the gross debt-to-EBITDA of 2.9 against the target range of 2.75 to 3.25 and earlier this month we announced the amendment of our existing credit facility that lowers our cost of capital and assuming constant LIBOR rates will result in approximately 5 million with annualized interest expense savings. We continue to fund incremental investments through organic growth through new product development and channel strategies to accelerate core market expansion. We remain focused on acquisition opportunities in emerging markets, emerging technologies and product portfolio expansion. Integration of previous acquisitions are on track and they are making contributions for our financial results. We\u2019re making good progress on developing our acquisition pipeline, tighter or long term strategy as well as developing our competencies globally in this area. We will continue to view shareholder distribution as a key component of the allocation. The company has repurchased approximately 1 million shares year-to-date for $50.3 million. Please go to slide number 13. You\u2019ll remember the slide from our Investor Day when we discussed our effective tax rate expectations. We continue to view our structure as a strategic asset of the company that we can leverage to facilitate operating strategies and to achieve a lower effective tax rate to accelerate earnings as well as cash flow growth. We ended 2013, with an effective tax rate of approximately 38% this was a result of tax essentially being prepared on a standalone or statutory rate basis. Our first communication for 2014 was that we anticipated an effective rate of 31% and then updated our guidance last quarter to reflect a 30% rate. Subsequent to this, we\u2019ve continued our tax strategy and planning efforts and we now anticipate a full year 2014 tax rate to be approximately 28%. The reduction from a prior guidance was a result of accelerating the execution of tax planning strategies. And as we\u2019ve discussed previously we set an initial target of a mid-20 rate by 2016. I\u2019m happy to report that we will exceed this target by 2015 a year earlier than originally anticipated. And I\u2019d also like to add that we do not see any impact or tax strategy with regard to recent inversion and Irish tax legislation changes. This was all made possible by the efforts of our strong tax team which evaluated and prioritized opportunities and invested appropriately to support the accelerated reduction in the effective tax rate. In addition, based on what has been achieved and a better view of the opportunities we have revised the objective to be below 20% by 2016. I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2014 guidance. Dave Petratis : Thanks Patrick. Please go to slide 14. For 2014 we expect revenues to be up approximately 4.5% for the full year. In the Americas, we expect high single-digit residential revenue growth and strong Venezuelan growth driven by pricing actions to offset material and other inflation. And although we realized nice growth in the quarter we still only expect modest non-residential revenue increases for the full year as institutional market recovery continues at a very slow pace. Our outlook for Europe revenue growth is now at negative 2% slightly worse than previous expectations. This reflects the net impact of our portfolio pruning, the currency exchange headwind that began in September and general market softness. Of note increased geopolitical uncertainty in the region continues to limit overall recovery and is an obstacle for a sustained growth. Given our system integration backlog exit in Q3, we are guiding to the revenue growth of approximately 10% in Asia Pacific region as previously announced our Asia Pacific team to our Bocom System brands and an alliance with China Telecom one the Wuhu, Citi Skynet project valued at approximately 25 million. This project continues our success with safe city projects in China. Please go to slide 15. We are increasing our 2014 EPS guidance. Adjusted earnings per share are now forecast to be in the range of $2.37 to $2.42 an increase of 10% to 12% from 2013 adjusted earnings per share. This is driven by operational improvements, European actions and a reduction in the effective tax rate while investing and positioning the company for future growth. Restructuring spin cost and the write off of debt issuance cost related to the amended credit facility are expected to be approximately $0.30 of the impact during the year resulting in an EPS range of $2.07 to $2.12. The effective tax rate assumption in the guidance is approximately 28% and outstanding diluted shares are approximately 97 million. Finally, the guidance does not reflect the potential risk of a devaluation of the Venezuela Bolivar. For more information on this topic, please refer to our Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the period ended September 30, 2014. I know everyone is interested in 2015 and we are in the process of developing our guidance and we\u2019ll provide more detail in our next earnings call. I can assure that we expect modest growth to continue next year with a continued slow March to recovery. U.S. residential markets are still a number of years away from what I believe to be a normal construction level of 1.5 million homes. And we are planning on unpredictable non-residential recovery but are positioned well to meet demand if recovery exceeds expectations in the year. Where we still see meaningful European growth occurring after 2015 we believe the 2015 European market will remain flat to negative driven by weak GDP growth political uncertainty and high debt levels. And the Asia Pacific market will continue to be one of the strongest growth regions albeit at a slower pace than recent history. Our plan for double-digit earnings growth in the business remains given the solid business fundamentals margin enhancement opportunity particularly in Europe and the tax rate reduction. Please go to slide 16. So to summarize I was pleased with the results and solid performance in the third quarter, we demonstrated the strong leverage potential of the company given revenue growth. We continue to focus on what matters, leaving the electro-mechanical convergence, driving core market expansion, improving European profitability, executing our tax strategy and driving on a balance and flexible capital allocation plan. I feel good about where we are in our first year and we are positioned for fourth quarter and long-term success. Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open. David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research : Yes, good morning everyone. Dave Petratis : Good morning David. David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research : North America strong performance so you had very strong incremental margins so I\u2019m just wondering was that the Venezuelan FX or could you just talk about the factors behind those strong incrementals? Dave Petratis : Yes so I would say Venezuela they contributed a little bit to the market improvements, we\u2019ve done a really good job in terms of offset inflation or price improvements exceeding inflation so there is some contribution there. So we\u2019ve been really pleased with the operating leverage in our core facilities here in Americas both on the commercial and residential side. So I think you\u2019re seeing a really good uplift in margins as associated with the incremental volume primarily. Good productivity offsetting inflation. David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research : I guess it looks like you\u2019re leveraging off investments that maybe you\u2019ve made in the past and so you had less incremental costs associated with those revenues, how much further sort of run rate you have in front of you on this, how much could we see incremental margins stay strong like this for the next couple of quarters or is it longer? Dave Petratis : I think we\u2019re leveraging investing of the past if you look at the roof line take outs and lean implementations in North America that have been driven over the last few years, we proved in Q3 that increased revenues have significant leverage capabilities in the company and as markets returned to normal we\u2019re very positive on our potential. Patrick Shannon : Yeah and I would just add a lot of the incremental margin will also be dependent upon our future investments. So we\u2019ve always kind a say we try to balance the two making sure we get some incremental margin associated with the incremental investments that drives future growth. So in the future you may not see such a big increase but it\u2019s all going to be dependent upon the level of investments we put in the business. David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research : Okay thanks for that. And then just secondly, can you just talk about within North American and your non-res business velocity through the quarter and how October may fit into that. Dave Petratis : I thought we commercially went out and took the opportunities that were on the table. I wouldn\u2019t call it velocity, the market was there we are able to convert it. We talk about in the discussion this morning that we believe there is growth opportunity in the fast moving true stock businesses. I felt in coming into the business that there was an opportunity there we\u2019ve ran some cast regions and what we called pro-express and the results were favorable. So in markets that maybe uncertain we\u2019re working hard and what I call self-help to get more than our fair share and this R&R like commercial space. David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research : Would that account for the increase spend and the finished goods inventories? Dave Petratis : A little bit but not significantly. David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the Robert Berry with Susquehanna International Group. Your line is now open. Robert Berry \u2013 Susquehanna International Group : Hey guys good morning. Dave Petratis : Good morning Robert Berry \u2013 Susquehanna International Group : Nice work on the tax rate. Maybe I wanted to actually just start there and clarify it sounds like the outlook now for 2015 is that the rate would be below the mid-20s. Dave Petratis : Yeah that\u2019s correct. I think a good way to think about it this year we\u2019re ending about a 28% effective tax rate we\u2019ve got a glide path and pretty good visibility by 2016 to get to 20%. The majority of that reduction of 8 points you would see next year. Robert Berry \u2013 Susquehanna International Group : And would you expect it to kind of filtering gradually through the year or should we just assume for the whole year whatever you\u2019re going to assume below the mid-20s. Dave Petratis : So we\u2019ll give more specific guidance in our fourth quarter earnings call relative to the annualized effective tax rate, but you will see it pretty much the whole year. As we continue to execute additional strategies and there will be some added benefits during the course of the year, but most of that will come in beginning of the year. Robert Berry \u2013 Susquehanna International Group : And what\u2019s the rate you\u2019re assuming in 4Q. Dave Petratis : We\u2019re about with the full year effective tax rate of 28% or about 24% for the quarter. Robert Berry \u2013 Susquehanna International Group : 24% okay. And then maybe just shifting focus to the Americas region it sounds like well it was very solid in quarter very good volume growth. But it sounds like there is some real caution around 4Q and easing. Is that just conservatism or was there strength in 3Q that was a little abnormal you don\u2019t seeing carrying forward. Dave Petratis : I believe this recovery is been one of the choppiest of my business career. So we\u2019re cautioned, our business softens in Q4 and in the Q1 just because of the construction season we\u2019ve got to be mindful of that. We\u2019re going to continue to focus on this commercial R&R through stock capability that will take several quarters and years to really master but I feel good about our position. Patrick Shannon : Yeah and then I would also add looking at the results is probably a little pull forward from Q4 and to Q3 in conjunction with our previously announced price increase that went into effect the first week in October. And if they talked about this repair replacement market, the new promo that we had in the market there for that so. Robert Berry \u2013 Susquehanna International Group : And then just finally a clarification on the impact from Venezuela price in the quarter. Is that just over a 3% or what was the impact from Venezuela on pricing in Americas? Patrick Shannon : So Venezuela price increase was basically if you look at the total increase for Americas up about 2.7% and our pricing all of that was associated with Venezuela. So commercial and residential were essentially flat for the quarter. Robert Berry \u2013 Susquehanna International Group : Right. Okay, great thank you. Dave Petratis : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research : Thank you and good morning fellas. Dave Petratis : Good morning Jeff. Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research : Good morning. Just a couple of questions back to the repair and renovation opportunity. As you stepped into that how is your view evolving on actually the size of the opportunity. And have you seen any competitive response obviously your gain there is someone else is paying and just wonder what the market reaction is if you\u2019ve seen that yet. Dave Petratis : We have size the opportunity we put it $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. We think we get less than our in title share of that have not seen the competitive response. I think you\u2019re familiar with the electrical industry. Having stock on the shelf and managing that through stock business have been neglected in our business model and believe that we can flex our capability there and whether a competitive response. Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research : Have you size your revenues there now current. Dave Petratis : Say it again. Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research : What\u2019s your revenue take in that piece of the market currently. Dave Petratis : I would more from a share perspective low single-digits. You get into the institutional and new construction we go up 25% to 30%. So we think there is gain there. We think we\u2019ve got some opening price points. Product gaps that we\u2019ve got a deal with but we see it is very opportunistic. Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research : And I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on institutional you gave some \u2013 color there, but sounds like we\u2019re still just kind a bumping along the bottom is that fair or do you see a little bit of a turn have thing. Just a color. Dave Petratis : I am bumping along the bottom with it, we\u2019re cautious I would say 2015 will lean positively, but this is a slow grind to normalization. Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research : Yeah. And then just one last one and then I\u2019ll move on for Patrick. Patrick should we expect to cash taxes to come down and locks up with just kind of what\u2019s going on in the P&L. Patrick Shannon : Yeah that the delta between book provision and cash should be relatively same actually cash will be lower this year so yes, it\u2019s at. So as the tax rate comes down that provides obviously more cash flow for the business to invest for future growth. So it\u2019s a good thing. Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Yeah thanks and good morning all. Dave Petratis : Good morning. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Maybe just on the tax rate. What is the is there any US margin impact overtime as part of your strategy in other words do you see any headwinds to US margins as you start to down this tax rate path more aggressively. Patrick Shannon : So as you guys know the majority of our pretax income is US centric. As we look into our strategy and kind of looking at what we think the potential rate can be in the future. We did not take into account any significant change in the mix of earnings. So that wasn\u2019t take in account. But as our businesses grow internationally and we improve the results at both Europe and Asia. I mean that will help a rate a little bit but not significantly. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Okay, alright. And secondly on EMEA, could you maybe give us a little more depth on is there progress there. Clearly you talked about weak markets one of your competitors noted I think 3% organic for themselves for they\u2019re more Northern European weighted. What in terms of how should we think about kind of market impact versus the things you\u2019re doing yourself consciously to narrow your scope and drive prior margins in the future? Patrick Shannon : I think you\u2019re probably familiar that we trend the portfolio in the UK with our door business. Our numbers are adjusted for that. It what you see is the softening of the business. I talk about that there is five or six markets that we\u2019re really well positioned in Italy, Spain is the example Greece. These are weak markets I\u2019ve certainly would trade some of the economic growth in Northern Europe. We think our Interflex business which is more access control is driving some growth but as we look at the overall space we\u2019re not encouraged that the markets is gone help us. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Well I guess the question from me then is the 6% and 19% goal as you\u2019ve called out previously. Are they still do they still apply a very much they did or any change in thinking on that front. Patrick Shannon : Yeah so the way I would characterize it is a lot of good progress this year should be up 300 basis points relative to last year\u2019s numbers. We\u2019ve got some restructuring benefit that will carryover in next year that will give us nice tailwind there. I\u2019ve got pretty good line of site to like an 8% margin basis of current volume. If you kind a look at the opportunities in terms of we still have a couple of unprofitable segments in the business that we can change. Taking a rightful shot approach from a pricing perspective not only markets centric but also looking at specific customers and then accelerating our productivity on the lean initiatives. To get to the 10% goal still have some wood to chop, but I think we can get there, but that would be on a kind of a flat volume relative to today. If markets continue to weakened and we\u2019ve got some pressure on volumes that will put pressure on live margin of 10%. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : And Patrick what timeframe is that 8% around. Patrick Shannon : That would that\u2019s a 2016 again good line of sight that. And need to execute some additional initiatives to put bridge the gap to 10%. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Right 2016 average margin though right. Patrick Shannon : Yes, yes. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Okay, alright. I\u2019ll hand it off thanks. Patrick Shannon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Saliq Khan with Imperial Capital. Your line is open. Saliq Khan - Imperial Capital : Great thank you. Good morning guys, taking behalf of Jeff Kessler today. Two real quick questions, the first one regarding Europe. Potentially as you\u2019re looking at the discretion improvement and trend in Europe. Many of the integrators that are out there right now would likely choose between an Allegion, [Alsa] and [Caba]. What are you doing right now essentially to be able to raise the overall profile with the distributors? Dave Petratis : Great question. Number one is a more work around our specifying capability. We were hanging on what I call three stock model you\u2019ve got a create demands from specification. Our partnership with [Eco Sholtek] is a good example of that they\u2019ve got an outstanding lean door offering and it gives us the opportunity to go in to specifies and talk about products that compete on fast and allows us to pull through stock products. So more work to do that some model investment. As I think about specifying pulls I tend to like to have people in a common room that are going out to customers versus one in Paris one in Bellona, one in Madrid. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re working. Second would be transferring some of our own lean initiatives to make that we\u2019re \u2013 our cycle times are shortened our delivery commitments are solid it would be a couple of areas. Saliq Khan - Imperial Capital : Great thank you. The other question I had was and sticking with the Europe itself. Interflex you guys have mentioned this previously this was the business that\u2019s been pre-sheltered with a relatively decentralized management team under in [crystal] obviously. So over the last 14 and 16 years the margins though if I recall the margins have been up for this business. Is there any other update that you guys are able to provide us we feel like this is a much better business model now than it was previously under the previous management team. Dave Petratis : Well thanks for that. If you visit us at the [SN] Show in Germany Interflex presented as a standalone company. We have named a new general manager for that business and with an effort to trying get them some oxygen I want to look at them and their performance and we\u2019ve set them up to do that. The second thing that we\u2019re really transforming there and it\u2019s part of our restructuring is they were trying to use direct go-to market model out of Germany and it was not working. We push them towards the VAR model it\u2019s in its infancy but I believe it\u2019s the right path. When I was at the [SN] Show I had the opportunity to speak with AON, the large insurance group Airbus, large auto manufacturers that we\u2019ve been successful with. They love the product they love the support we just need to get that out of the \u2013 beyond the German borders we think the VAR model helps us do that. Good little asset in that European portfolio. Saliq Khan - Imperial Capital : Great. Well I have one more question sorry. As looking at essentially the electronic locks in the access control industry (inaudible) it for that business essentially somewhere about ballpark of \u2013 little bit lower than the mechanical side. I envision that would reverse to some point. Is there anything that you\u2019re seeing in the marketplace that could help us better understand that. Dave Petratis : Ask me that question once more. Saliq Khan - Imperial Capital : Sure as you\u2019re looking at the electronic locks in the access control business overall, the margins tend to be say 8% to 15% lower than the mechanical side. It could be functionally possibly hard complexity as well. And that I would envision would likely reverse to some point. Is there anything that you\u2019re seeing in the marketplace right now that can provide us more color within that? Dave Petratis : As I think about our ENGAGE technology and the NDE platform. In my mind it opens up opportunities to-date. Yes you\u2019re right it\u2019s the margins could be a bit softer than our mechanical. But it creates a new market opportunity it\u2019s like going from analog phones to digital phones. It\u2019s like going from cable TV to satellite I means it\u2019s we\u2019re opening up new markets people were not considering automating their locks because you had very high price complex installation capabilities with the screwdriver and an iPad you can install these lock capabilities. So we don\u2019t expect a lot of cannibalization we\u2019re really for a commercial building order simplifying his life with new products. We\u2019ve just got it out there more to learn but from my perspective we\u2019re opening up new markets. Saliq Khan - Imperial Capital : Great. Thank you all. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeremy Kepron CLSA. Your line is now open. Jeremy Kepron \u2013 CLSA: Thanks and good morning. Could you comment on mix and pricing going into the next couple of quarters understand the residential growth is sort of coming down and non-res on the other hand is should be picking up a little bit. And if we exclude the Venezuela effect, how should we think about mix in prices going forward. Patrick Shannon : So as we discussed we execute it as a price increase at the beginning of this quarter. I would anticipate that we should see better price realization in our core business area in Americas than Q4 compared to what we saw in Q3 not significant but some incremental volume there. From a mix perspective don\u2019t see a big change relative to the mix I mean maybe a little bit higher residential and mechanical business, but wouldn\u2019t anticipate that to have a significant impact on margins particularly relative to the prior year quarter. So not a big impact there. Dave Petratis : Right I would also say from a revenue standpoint demand is going to hold steady. As we go into Q4 and Q1 it some of the softest period of the construction year and we want get the volume leverage that we would enjoy like in Q2 and Q3. Jeremy Kepron \u2013 CLSA: Okay and Dave can you give us an update on the M&A landscape what are you seeing, are you seeing the asking price is coming up particularly when you look at Asia and just give us a sense of what we should expect over the next 8, 12 months as from a region in terms of M&A? Dave Petratis : There is a lot of work in building this M&A pipeline, satisfied with the progress we got more work to do I challenged our general managers get our teams engaged in terms of technology and opportunities building those relationships and opportunities. I spent a week in China building relationships the softening there may be increases a little bit sense of urgency but you look at that market over the next five years it\u2019s going to double so a big step change in valuations I don\u2019t see it. I\u2019m pleased with the progress we\u2019re making in terms of the building of the pipeline of, it\u2019s a high priority for us and it takes a lot of work. Jeremy Kepron \u2013 CLSA: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : (Operator Instructions) our next question comes from Charles Clarke with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Charles Clarke \u2013 Credit Suisse : Hey guys. Dave Petratis : Charles good afternoon. Charles Clarke \u2013 Credit Suisse : Just had a couple quick housekeeping items, few things that surprised me just in the quarter to non-controlling interest and the corporate expense, I mean the corporate expense came up like 70 million bucks sequentially non-controlling interest as well as just to know if there are any comments on kind of why or kind of how would you think about those two line items kind of moving forward? Dave Petratis : Well I\u2019ll take corporate expense, Patrick will provide some comments as well. Number one investing, I think everybody is pretty pleased with the optimization of our tax structure and methods we\u2019re spending on longer-term tax rate that doesn\u2019t come from freight. I would say Patrick and I view on that as we\u2019ve been very aggressive from an investment perspective to make sure that that realization comes true we think it is a very good trade up second is, we were active on the M&A pipeline, due diligence is expensive it doesn\u2019t mean we put something on the hook. Third is as we have stepped up our electronic investments in new products making sure that we protect ourselves from a patent portfolio patent exposure has been significantly more expensive than we\u2019d budgeted and then the last would be IT we as we have split off from \u2013 there were needs again we want to make sure that we got the IT capabilities to be able to support a very profitable business so those would be some of things. On the non-controlling Patrick? Patrick Shannon : Yeah on the non-controlling interest, a big piece of that is related to our joint venture with Venezuela and so you\u2019re seeing a step up in the performance relative to that entity and that would be the sequential on year-over-year increase there. Charles Clarke \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay great and then just to confirm the refinancing that you guys worked on this month that should bring the interest expense down by 5 million bucks next year? Dave Petratis : Assuming the same LIBOR rates as today yes. Charles Clarke \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay, great. Thanks. I\u2019ll hop back in the queue. Operator : Our next question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Your line is open. Joshua Pokrzywinski \u2013 Buckingham Research : Hi good morning guys. Dave Petratis : Good morning. Joshua Pokrzywinski \u2013 Buckingham Research : So I guess just a clarification from that last question on corporate expense Dave you gave a lot of detail there on what\u2019s driving that in the near term is that to say that we\u2019re seeing a permanent step up in corporate expense to some double-digit number quarterly to support this lower tax rate or is it kind of with a one-time investment to get that optimized and then corporate sells out something more sustainably lower? Dave Petratis : No I think you got to look at it like sustaining going forward it will be in the double-digit area for the balance of this year and then going into 2015. Some of it is to what Dave had talked about and some of it is just additional cost associated with standalone publicly traded company. Joshua Pokrzywinski \u2013 Buckingham Research : Okay that\u2019s helpful and then on the I guess implied 4Q particularly in Americas I know you mentioned some pull forward there do you have a rough sense of what that would look like and then I guess just thinking about how all that rolls up in the EPS guidance it seems like the others are pretty draconic outlook for Americas margins implied in that if you\u2019re going to get that that 300 basis points you talked about in EMEA it seems like the plug number seems to be a lower margin in the Americas and if I recall you have a pretty easy comp there from last year so I guess just first what\u2019s the pull forward and then second what should we be thinking about is in the outside driver on margins in the fourth quarter in Americas? Dave Petratis : Yeah so the pull forward I would call it low single-digits millions there or assuming mid-single-digits it\u2019s not a significant pull forward but if you look at the percentage of year-over-year revenue increase 1.5% increase there as result of that relative to the margins going forward you\u2019re exactly right there is an easy comparison for this year relative to 2013 what we are anticipating margin improvement in Americas and we\u2019ll see that just through the incremental volume leverage productivity offsetting inflation some incremental price realization the comments on Europe, just to be clear the 300 basis points last year we reported 1% operating margin this year we\u2019ll end a little bit north of 4% of 300 basis points when you restate for the UK door divestiture year-over-year it\u2019s more like 200 basis points so that maybe a part of your delta that you\u2019re seeing. The other piece relative to the global margin relative to the prior year comparison as Dave talked about you\u2019ve got some headwinds relative to the corporate expenditures that\u2019s putting a little pressure on that overall margins. Joshua Pokrzywinski \u2013 Buckingham Research : Okay so I guess you should still see good volume leverage in the fourth quarter it\u2019s in Americas maybe some of that\u2019s easy comp and margins in EMEA should still be seasonally pretty solid and maybe there is some fine tuning there around with the year-over-year old slide just based on some mix issue or I guess the different composition in the business? Dave Petratis : Yeah correct. Joshua Pokrzywinski \u2013 Buckingham Research : Okay and then I guess just lastly how are you guys thinking or not thinking about the cadence of capital allocation here you\u2019ve been asked this you\u2019re in the better part of the year at this point I think the pipeline you\u2019ve mentioned you\u2019ve done a lot of work there how periods we see you guys kind of dip the tail in the water into buyback in the absence of deals kind of from this point now that you\u2019re flushed out a little bit more of a pipeline? Dave Petratis : I would say we\u2019ll continue the balanced approach if we think stock buybacks, leads embedded discounts we have the ability to flux M&A will remind the priority. Organic growth as we\u2019ve displayed in this quarter is a great lever we like this investments in this R&R and like commercials in the U.S. but we\u2019re prudent we\u2019re investors and where we see good long-term return opportunities we\u2019re going to pull those levers. Joshua Pokrzywinski \u2013 Buckingham Research : Got you that\u2019s helpful. All right thanks guys. Operator : Though I am showing no further questions at this time, I\u2019d like to hand the call back to Tom Martineau for closing remarks. Tom Martineau : Thank you and we appreciate everybody joining us today for the call. Have a safe day. Dave Petratis : Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does concludes today\u2019s program, you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer-session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Martineau, Director, Investor Relations. Please begin. Tom Martineau : Thank you, Latoya. Good morning, welcome and thank for joining us for the fourth quarter 2014 Allegion earnings call. With me today is Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and the presentation which we will refer to you in today\u2019s call are available on our Web site at www.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our Web site. Please go to Slide two. Statements made in today\u2019s call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results. The Company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Our release and today\u2019s commentary includes non-GAAP financial measures which exclude restructuring and spin expenses. Also included in these adjustments are the impacts related to a movement in measuring results in Venezuela from the official exchange rate of VEF6.3 per U.S. dollar to using the Venezuelan governments SICAD II exchange rate of VEF50 per U.S. dollar. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release and the quarterly information in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation for further details. Also in the fourth quarter of 2014 the Company changed its method of accounting so that all inventory is now based on first-in first-out method from the last-in first-out method. The financial statements for all periods have been revised for this change and recapped quarterly data has been provided in the appendix of today's presentation. The impact of this adjustment was favorable by 1.3 million or $0.01 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2013. The impact to the year ended December 31, 2014 was favorable by 0.4 million. As a result our tax and inventory accounting are now on the same basis. And the Company achieves global consistency with one inventory accounting treatment. Please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave Petratis : Thanks Tom. Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us today. Allegion posted another strong quarter of organic growth, operating leverage and cash flow generation. Revenues were 573 million up 5.5% on an adjusted basis versus last year and up 7.6% on an organic basis. The Americas region delivered strong organic growth of 8.4% with increases in all segments and the timing of large system integration projects drove organic growth of 17% in Asia-Pacific region. Organic revenues were relatively flat in Europe reflecting ongoing market softness. Adjusted operating income of 106 million increased 9% versus last year and adjusted operating margin increased 60 basis points for the company reflecting solid operating leverage on the incremental volume and improved pricing. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.76 increased 26.7% versus the prior year. Patrick will cover the details later. We're issuing our full year 2015 EPS guidance of $2.65 to $2.75 an increase of 12% to 17% compared to adjusted 2014 EPS excluding Venezuela. The guidance reflect overall organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%. Please go to Slide 4. Now that we've completed our first full year as a standalone public company I would like to take a moment to review our performance. First, it\u2019s hard to appreciate the amount of effort it takes to standup a company. We\u2019re truly fortunate to have a strong team at Allegion that embraces the change necessary, while ensuring we met our customer and shareholder commitments. And although you don\u2019t see it as a metric on the slide, one of our core values is to be safe and healthy, which we focus on every single day of the year. We finished 2014 with a loss time incident rate of less than 1%, 26 locations with zero loss time days, 13 sites celebrated a million hour milestone without loss time incident and in our Bogota facility there was an 81% reduction in the number of injuries, resulting in zero life loss time days in our first full year of ownership. Allegion is one of the safest companies in the world, I\u2019m extremely proud of this. It\u2019s a true north metric of Allegion\u2019s mass manufacturing excellence and the commitment to safety. Last year at this time I shared with you the 2014 financial goals of the company. We delivered revenue in the expected range, with some incremental volume covering lower than expected price. I\u2019m pleased with the top-line performance of the business, given the challenging market environments and currency headwinds. Adjusted earnings per share came in at the high-end of our range and taking into account the realization of our lower effective tax rate, we exceeded the high-end of our original guidance by $0.09. Spin and restructuring expenses were within expected ranges and we over delivered on available cash flow. It was a solid first year for Allegion and I believe we are positioned well for 2015 and the long-term growth to deliver high shareholder returns. Please go to Slide 5. Globally we hit the ground running in 2014 to secure large project customer wins for the Allegion portfolio. This slide reflects a sampling of some of the project wins in 2014. We continued to leverage our strong institutional knowledge with project wins in education and healthcare. We\u2019re proud to have outfitted both in elementary school and middle school in Shanghai, China with Schlage Locks as part of a safe campus initiative and to have our locks and accessories at the premier Stanford Medical Center in Fargo, North Dakota. It\u2019s exciting to also note that Allegion is pioneering safety and security for world traveling facilities like Levi\u2019s Stadium which is the new home of The San Francisco 49ers as well as notable hotels and office spaces alike. Please go to Slide 6. Of course our project wins are also highly reliant on our ability to innovate and in 2014 it was a year of significant innovation investment with Allegion\u2019s emphasis on electromechanical conversions, we launched both ENGAGE Technology and Schlage Touch. With ENGAGE Technology, we\u2019re changing the way commercial building owners and tenants think about the interior building access. ENGAGE is a connectivity platform that is easy to install, manage and use. Our Schlage NDE Series wireless locks with ENGAGE Technology can be installed in minutes with a screwdriver and allow users to manage electronic credentials with cloud-based Web and mobile apps. Schlage Touch was launched in October aligned with the keyless era we\u2019ve been pioneering for homeowners, given the ability to unlock their doors using a stylish touch-screen pin pad. For residential we\u2019ve really emphasized not just the strength of our locks, but the style and design. In 2014, we expanded our style options to offer more choices to our customers. We\u2019re now offering more design in finished options that support both modern and traditional taste. Allegion also expanded style options for high-end non-residential and multi-family customers with the M Collection Series of levers for Schlage and Von Duprin. In our non-residential mechanical product lines we created more specialized applications for our customers, this includes the Von Duprin AX device, which was the first and currently only UL-certified exit device to meet the new California building code five pound operating force requirement and the Von Duprin Quiet electric latch for medical facilities where both patient and caregivers value an environment free of excessive noise from traditional exit operations. Please go to Slide 7. As you probably seen Allegion the recently launched Schlage Sense in January 2015 as an integral part of Schlage\u2019s leadership position in the Internet-of-things as an innovate extension of the keyless era the residential lock comes with a mobile app that allows homeowners to manage it with their phones or with the locks\u2019 touch-screen pin pad. Specifically, it\u2019s designed to work with Apple\u2019s HomeKit technology providing advanced security with end-to-end encryption and authentication between the Schlage Sense lock and iPhone and iPad and iTouch. HomeKit also lets consumers control their Schlage Sense lock with their voice using theory. The Schlage Sense system can manage up to 30 codes at the same time. Its app allows homeowners to create and delete access codes, check unlock status and view activity. Residents can also use the app to update settings and check battery life without connecting to an existing home automation system or pay a monthly subscription charge. Schlage Sense launched at the Consumer Electronics Show and had over 300 million impressions in one week. Major news outlets applauded the innovation, Wired named it one of the 11 hot products from the show, Fox News named it as one of their top-eight list of the most innovative products there and CNET praised the talk-to-unlock capability. With Schlage Sense we're continuing to generate positive coverage for Allegion and expect the product to be available for our customers later this year. To help stay on the forefront of innovation and the growth of the Internet-of-things Allegion also recently made an equity investment in iDevices. iDevices like Schlage launched the next-generation connected home solution at the Consumer Electronics Show and our partnership will amplify the impact of Schlage Sense on the market. As part of the minority stake in the company Allegion and iDevices entered into a joint technology agreement. Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I'll be back to update our full year 2015 guidance. Patrick Shannon : Thanks Dave and good morning everyone. Please go to Slide Number 8. This slide depicts the components of our revenue for both fourth quarter and full year. This is helpful as the impact of pricing in Venezuela and currency headwinds across the business brought quite a bit of noise in the results. If you focus on the organic growth we delivered 7.6% and 5.1% growth for the fourth quarter and full year respectively. Both include 2% of price increase associated with Venezuela, the stronger organic growth reflects improving markets and introduction of new products. Pricing benefits have been mostly driven by Venezuela however we're seeing pricing improvement sequentially and expect to gain improved traction in the first half of 2015 particularly in our U.S. non-residential business. One another things to note is the currency line, we really started to see the impact of a weaker euro in the fourth quarter, adding the impacts of a softer Canadian dollar, Chinese RMB and Australian dollar and you will see a fourth quarter year-over-year impact of a negative 2.4%. Although the strong U.S. dollar will continue to create pressure on the bottom-line, it is important to remember that most of our costs were in the same region with our revenues, which mitigates some of the income pressure. Please go to Slide Number 9. Reported net revenues for the quarter were 573.5 million as mentioned on the previous slide this reflects an increase of 5.5% versus the prior year up 7.6% on an organic basis inclusive of Venezuela pricing. We realized high single-digit growth in the Americas with growth in all segments of the market, U.S. commercial grew low single-digits and residential segments increased mid single-digits. Latin America was up significantly primarily due to incremental price realization in Venezuela to offset inflation. EMEA revenues were down approximately 10% driven by currency headwind. Asia-Pacific revenues were up over 17% due to strong mechanical hardware and the timing of large system integration projects. Adjusted operating income of 106.6 million increased 9% compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin of 18.6% reflects an increase of 60 basis points versus the prior year, it's favorable price, volume leverage and productivity more than offset increased investments and inflation. We're extremely pleased with the incremental operating leverage of the business particularly as we continue to make incremental growth investments for new products and channel development in order to accelerate our earnings growth and return on capital. Please go to Slide Number 10. This reflects our EPS reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2013 reported EPS was $0.12 a share, adjusting for prior year one-time separation and restructuring expenses of $0.04 and $0.44 related to discrete tax items the 2013 reported EPS was $0.60. Operational results increased EPS by $0.13 as pricing, productivity and favorable operating leverage more than offset inflation. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate to 26.3% rose $0.07 per share improvement versus the prior year. Other net items added $0.04 primarily due to foreign exchange gains, offset by $0.01 of incremental interest expense. Next, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities, for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategy specific to taxes and M&A were a $0.07 reduction, this results in adjusted fourth quarter 2014 EPS of $0.76 a share. Continuing on, we have a negative $0.39 per share reduction consisting of $0.08 of restructuring and spin related expenses, $0.09 for the Venezuelan devaluation charge to revalue monetary assets, $0.19 for non-cash impairment charge to adjust Venezuelan inventory balances and $0.03 for the extinguishment of capitalized debt cost related to the October amendment and extension of our senior credit facility. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at the fourth quarter 2014 reported EPS of $0.37. Please go to Slide Number 11. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were 390.8 million up 8.4% on an adjusted basis. Removing the impact of Venezuelan price increases, revenues were up 5.4% on an adjusted basis. Higher volumes, Venezuela pricing and the acquisition of Schlage de Colombia in January 2014 offset unfavorable currency movement in Canada. Volumes improved in the non-residential segment by low single-digits led by the strength in mechanical and door businesses. U.S. residential growth in the mid single-digits was driven by strength in the builder and e-commerce segments. Revenues in Venezuela doubled year-over-year led primarily by price. Americas\u2019 adjusted operating income of 100 million was up 13.3% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 110 basis points due to favorable volume leverage, price and productivity that more than offset inflation and ongoing investments in new products and channel development. Please go to Slide Number 12. Fourth quarter revenues for the EMEA region were 103.5 million down 10.3% and down 0.3% on an organic basis. Currency headwind continues to be a challenge in the region due to the softening euro and the Russian ruble which impacts Eastern European sales. Market driven weakness in hardware sales in France and Italy were mostly offset by strength in the Interflex and hospitality businesses. EMEA adjusted operating income of 11.6 million was down 13.4% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 11.2% down 40 basis points primarily due to unfavorable product and market mix. For the full year, adjusted operating profit has more than doubled delivering 210 basis points of improvement. When including the impact of the UK door divestiture, operating margins improved 280 basis points compared to the reported results in 2013. The Company continues to target an operating margin of 10% in 2016 with ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives, specific customer and market pricing actions and the elimination of unprofitable business. Please go to Slide Number 13. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were 79.2 million up 17%. The revenue growth was driven by mid-teen system integration growth and high-teen mechanical hardware growth. Asia-Pacific adjusted operating income of 9.7 million was up 42.6% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 220 basis points due to incremental volume leverage and favorable margins from the FSH acquisition completed in Q2 2014. Please go to Slide Number 14. Available cash flow for 2014 was 207.5 million a decrease of 1.6 million compared to the prior year. The reduction reflects higher capital expenditures of 31.3 million mostly offset by improved working capital. The incremental capital expenditures were associated with new product development, information systems and spin related projects. We continue to operate with a very effective working capital structure and realized a 15% improvement in our cash conversion cycle for the year. Full year available cash flow ended the year at 111% of net earnings from continuing operations exceeding our original goal of 100%. Please go to Slide Number 15. By now the slide will be very familiar as it reflects our commitment to a balanced and flexible capital allocation strategy. We ended the year with gross debt to adjusted-EBITDA of 2.9 well within a normalized target range of 2.75 to 3.25. We continue to fund incremental investments in organic growth for new product development, channel strategies and operational excellence to accelerate core market expansion. We believe these investments will enable the company to grow in an accelerated pace and faster than the broader market. We remain focused on growing our portfolio through acquisitions. Dave already mentioned the iDevices equity investment made earlier this month and we have additional opportunities that are deep in the pipeline process. Over the course of the past year the company has developed an acquisition strategy, built capability and developed an acquisition pipeline. We want to keep our flexibility and our balance sheet optionality available until we vet and conclude on all M&A opportunities. Please go to Slide Number 16. Our full year 2014 effective tax rate was 28.6% and we're forecasting a full year 2015 effective rate of approximately 22% as a result of the tax strategies executed in 2014. We continue to view our structure as a strategic asset of the company where we can leverage to move cash efficiently through the business and achieve a lower effective tax rate to accelerate earnings, as well as cash flow growth. We're still targeting our effective rate to be at or below 20% next year. Please go to Slide Number 17. Before I hand things back to Dave, I want to speak about our Venezuela business and the impact of the devaluation. The recent drop in the price of oil has accelerated a deterioration of the economic conditions in Venezuela and the company concluded that the SICAD II exchange rate was the most appropriate rate to use at the end of the year. This decision had two immediate impacts. First we devalued the bolivar denominated monetary assets resulting in a pre-tax charge of 12.1 million or negative $0.09 per share. Second we took a non-cash before tax inventory impairment charge of 33.3 million or negative $0.19. This impairment charge was recorded in cost of goods sold and reflected the lower of cost and market valuation of the inventory held in Venezuela. As a result of the change in exchange rates there will be significant ongoing translation impact related to the devaluation which will essentially eliminate the reported 2014 results associated with the Venezuela business. This month the Venezuelan government announced changes to an exchange rate system that introduced a new market-based system called the Marginal Currency System or SIMADI. The company is currently evaluating this announcement. Adoption to the SIMADI rate would result in additional charges to re-measure the net monetary assets and impair other assets. I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update of our full year 2015 guidance. Dave Petratis : Thanks Patrick. Please go to Slide 18. As we look forward to 2015 we will continue to be faced with current fee volatility and a challenging macroeconomic environment. In the Americas we remain cautious but increasingly positive on the U.S. non-residential market recovery. We're still in the early days of a construction rebound and estimate that we are only 75% to 80% of the pre-recession peak. The recovery will continue at a much slower pace as compared to historic cycles as the economy navigates tight labor availability and modest improvements in public spending. This is especially true as it relates to the institutional segment which is approximately 60% of our non-residential revenue. As such we see the non-residential markets growing at low single-digits in 2015. The commercial new construction markets will continue to grow in low to mid single-digit with the institutional markets beginning to improve. The non-residential after market growth will approximate GDP growth and remain in a low single-digit range. The U.S. residential markets will increase mid single-digit driven by both builder and big box segments as we continue our slow and steady recovery out of the recession. Single-family home construction which remains approximately 30% below historic average will continue its recovery, although we don't expect to see normal levels for a few more years. The multi-family segment will continue to remain strong. Consolidating the market outlooks we project organic revenue growth in the Americas of 4% to 5%. Foreign exchange headwinds from Venezuela and Canada will be about 6 to 8 percentage points leaving us with a reported revenue growth of negative 2% to negative 3%. Our outlook in Europe continues to remain subdued driven by weak GDP growth, political uncertainty and high debt. The Southern markets remain soft with relatively slow growth as monetary policy easing helps to support recovery. We project low growth in the non-residential construction markets in Germany and the UK, France and Italy will see slight improvements supported by renovation activity offsetting weak new construction and Eastern Europe growth will struggle given geo-political climates. All-in we project EMEA organic growth to be flat to negative 2%. Taking into account currency headwinds in the region, we expect recorded revenue of negative 9% to negative 11%. The Asia-Pacific market to continued to show mid single-digit growth in both residential and non-residential segments, growth in China continues but at a slower rate than recent history. Australia and New Zealand will continue to improve, while North Asia will be flat driven by soft residential construction. Organic growth in the region is estimated to be 6% to 8%. Total revenue is estimated to be 5% to 7%. All-in, we are projecting organic growth of 3% to 4% for Allegion. Incorporating the currency headwinds, we expect total revenue of negative 3% to negative 4%. Please go to Slide 19. Our 2015 earnings per share range is 2.65 to 2.75 an increase of 12% to 17% compared to 2014 adjusted results, excluding Venezuela. The earnings increase is primarily driven by operational improvements and tax rate charge partially offset by investments in the business, Venezuela devaluation and EMEA currency headwind and non-recurring exchange rate gains and other income. Investments will be predominantly focused on new products and channel of development to meet demands of the electromechanical conversion as well as driving solutions for the underserved repair and replacement market. The full year effective tax rate assumption of the guidance is approximately 22% and our outstanding diluted shares are approximately 97 million. As mentioned previously, the guidance has assumed minimal contribution from Venezuela. And although we don\u2019t typically provide quarterly guidance, it\u2019s important to note that margins early in the year will be under some pressure on a year-over-year basis due to carryover expenditures which were not in place at the beginning of 2014 as well as new investments in 2015. Please go to Slide 20. Let me finish by reiterating that I\u2019m pleased with our 2014 results. We made significant progress in our first year, we delivered solid organic revenue growth, we increased operating margins while investing for future growth, made significant progress on our tax planning strategies, established a foundation for ongoing margin improvement in Europe and continue to achieve a high level of cash conversion performance. We enter 2015 positioned well and we\u2019ll build on our results. We remain focused on our growth pillars, core market expansion, innovation, growth in emerging markets, enterprise excellence and opportunistic acquisitions. And I believe we have the right team in place that will drive long-term growth that will deliver value to shareholder. Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Due to time constraints, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Charles Clarke of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Charles Clarke : Yes just wondered if you could give a quick update on capital allocation. I think in the prepared remarks you guys have talked about some deals that you were close on, close to getting over the goal line with and then obviously no reduction in share account in the guidance. So if you can just give an update on the capital allocation that\u2019d be great? Dave Petratis : Yes sure, so as we indicated basically three pillars in capital allocation, the first being organic growth opportunities and as you saw in the guidance, we\u2019re going to continue to invest in the business for things that we feel are aligned with our strategy obviously and it can accelerate our growth faster than the market. I feel pretty good about those particular opportunities and the fully vetted will provide a good return on capital going forward. As we look at the M&A front, I\u2019d say we\u2019ve got a much broader acquisition pipeline certainly than we did a year ago. I feel very confident that you\u2019ll be seeing a step-up in activity here in the short-term, so we\u2019re still vetting a lot of opportunities. I would characterize the delta between say M&A and share distribution would be if we don\u2019t see opportunities to expand our business and product portfolio in M&A front, we would be looking at accelerating shareholder distribution, but right now that\u2019s not what we\u2019re going to be doing. We will be offsetting our dilution associated with management compensation plans. The idea is not to hoard cash on the balance sheet, so to the extent we\u2019re not increasing our M&A activity, you\u2019d be seeing a further step-up in shareholder distributions. Charles Clarke : And just as a question to the ending leverage, 2.9 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA, does that adjusted EBITDA -- does that exclude Venezuela or kind of including the Venezuelan markdowns, the leverage would be a little bit higher? Dave Petratis : Yes so that would be on a reported basis, so including Venezuela, so if you were to kind of take out Venezuela then the ratio would go up a little bit. Charles Clarke : And then just maybe a housekeeping, you guys are targeting the 95% cash conversion this year versus just a target of 100. Is that due to some timing on payments or\u2026? Dave Petratis : Yes predominantly, so if you look at this business over the last three years we've averaged ACF as a percentage of continuing operations earnings of around 110%. So I would look at 2015 as a unusual year, we've had some one-time tax payments that we need to make as a result of our tax restructuring activities that took place last year. One-off on a go forward basis 2016 forward, as you know this is a great company in terms of cash flow generation and we should be north of 100% on average going forward. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Your line is open. Steven Winoker : Lot to cover here, the first one is on the actual price versus volume growth in the US within the Americas. Could you break that out a little bit more for us in terms of what you actually saw in the quarter? Patrick Shannon : So again all inclusive if you look at including Venezuela good volume growth. Steven Winoker : Just the U.S. Patrick. Patrick Shannon : Just the U.S., bear with me for just a minute, so most of the organic growth there was volume very little price improvement. We were able to get some sequential pricing improvement and leverage from our non-res business from the price increase we put in October last year. Residential not much a price improvement but we did sequentially see some price improvement. So in summary the majority of the increase there was all volume related. Steven Winoker : And given the other comments you made, is that low single-digit volume then for the U.S., or low single organic? Patrick Shannon : Yes, low to mid collectively non-res and res, yes. Steven Winoker : And then on EMEA, maybe talk a little bit more detail from Page 12 about the progress that Lucia is making there. It's a little hard to tell, given all the puts and takes that are going on, what is going on with the plan. I know you will give us more detail at the investor day, but I'm just trying to get a sense for where you really are in terms of that comment -- recovery plan accelerating productivity versus the mix impact that resulted in the lower margin? Dave Petratis : Well I'll let Patrick give you the some of the financial metrics. But we're on a good track, we doubled the operating income '13 to '14, cost take out -- what we've been extremely aggressive on is prune that business, that was embedded and that pruning is helping us to drive improvement. Our long-term goal 10% OI as we exit the year still stands and move into '16. The end-markets remain difficult. Patrick Shannon : Yes I would just add Steve ended the year kind of where we had anticipated maybe a little light when we started the year, we did get the 280 basis points improvement we had targeted beginning at around 300. The mix element a little pressure there as the Eastern European sales a little bit softer than what we'd like to see. Whereas Dave indicated still targeting the 10% number by 2016, as I look at 2015 you could assume kind of similar performance in terms of margin improvement year-over-year and a lot of that coming from some of the carryover activities that took place in a restructuring in 2014. Again we're going to take a rifle shot approach on pricing, specific to customers and markets. And then the ongoing productivity and cost containment I think will be primary drivers there. Steven Winoker : And if I could to sneak one in back to that capital allocation point you made. Patrick, at the last investor day you talked about a willingness to stretch even up to four times leverage for, quote, the right deal or the right opportunities. Are you guys still feeling confident that you would be willing to go there, or is there a reason to be more conservative these days? How are you feeling? Patrick Shannon : No, very confident to stretch it to four times for the right transaction would not hesitate given the strong cash flow generation of this business and the earnings obviously we'll be acquiring, so that wouldn't be an issue. When we give the range of debt to EBITDA there, I look at that more on a normalized basis it doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t be a little bit outside of the balance there, but over a long-term that\u2019s where we\u2019d like to be and how we manage the business. Dave Petratis : And I can\u2019t reemphasize that again for the right opportunity with and right fit with the company, we will stretch. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski of Buckingham Research. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : I guess not being able to see some of the specific margin parameters or CorpEx for 2015 some of this is a little backed into, but it looks like your incremental margin assumption in the Americans, ex-investment, ex-Venezuela, is pretty low, call it 30 or below by my math. Is there something else going on in that? It sounds like institutional is getting better, price uptake you expect to be better, and clearly you guys had good progress in 2014 on margin expansion even with investment. So I guess first is, is that math right? And then secondly, is there something I am missing in some of the mix dynamics in the \u201915 in the Americas? Dave Petratis : Yes so the margin excluding Venezuela improvement year-over-year is higher than what you indicated, so we\u2019ll have to maybe take it offline and look at your assumptions in terms of the mix component and taking out Venezuela. And we should see incremental pricing improvement, we\u2019re in kind of still a low inflationary environment so there should be some incremental leverage there it would be added to that, volume improvement net of investment, so we should still see some continued improvement in the Americas margin there. And the same is true for the overall company as well as the other regions and businesses of the world. Josh Pokrzywinski : And then I guess as we get out of 2015 I appreciate you guys spiking out the investments and where those are focused. Of those three buckets that you broke down in the $0.15 to $0.20, what stays, what goes, what gets bigger, what gets smaller from here and among the new products, channel marketing and some of the more systems-oriented spending? Dave Petratis : Yes so I would say as we look forward to 2016 and beyond sequentially the, incrementally the investments come down okay and the dollars will inherently stay, but incrementally the numbers will come down. So I would be looking at some incremental investment year-over-year, but not to the magnitude of $0.15 to $0.20. Josh Pokrzywinski : And then just one last one more housekeeping, what are you guys targeting for corporate expense in 2015? Dave Petratis : So we ended the year as you saw at 44 million, you should be thinking about an additional 10 million or so on top of the 44, so that would give you a quarterly run-rate around 13 million to 14 million. And let me just add the delta there the increase in 2015 versus 2014, 75% predominantly is investment related, IT systems associated with our ERP deployment and we\u2019re going to continue to invest in incremental tax expense to drive our tax rate lower for 2016 and beyond. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : A couple of other things, just to clarify on the comment on price, it was a little unclear because you mentioned price and then you mentioned deflation. Are you actually talking an improvement in net price as is, or is that kind of a price cost comment you are making there because of some relief on the cost side? Dave Petratis : So sorry about the confusion, but the comment was there should be a delta improvement price over material inflation. Jeff Sprague : And that is driven mostly by materials deflation, though, I would take it? Dave Petratis : Correct. Jeff Sprague : And then the comment on non-resi pricing, that sounded like it was specifically targeted on pricing. Is there some particular area within U.S. non-res where you see price opportunity, or what is really going on there? Dave Petratis : We got traction in Q4 on our pricing initiatives and we feel that that will carry into 2015. Jeff Sprague : And on currency, are there hedge benefits that we should expect coming through below the line as a partial offset to some of the headline translation impact that we see? Or what, if anything, are you doing on hedging? Dave Petratis : So we do hedge our cash flow exposures, all the known exposures. You\u2019ll see some favorability on what I call transaction exchange, but only minimal amounts. The majority of our cost and revenues are kind of in the region and so there is a natural hedge there, so we don\u2019t have a lot of exposure relative to transactional gains or losses. Jeff Sprague : And then just finally on the growth spending is there a figure you have in mind or something you could guide us to think about impact on the top line from actions you started taking in \u201914 and now ramping up in \u201915? Is there a discernible impact on your organic growth in \u201915 from these actions and how would you expect that to play out going forward? Dave Petratis : I would like to maybe reserve that for midyear. We made significant investments in '14 the NDX would be a good example of that, those are going on the shelf of our wholesalers and I would like to see the actual pull through. I would say new products should help us grow as those get into the market on both the residential and non-residential. Second is a longer term investment is in our channel development and this is where we think in the light commercial repair and replacement that we\u2019re getting less than our share, so I am investing and we should be able to see traction as we move through 2015. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Your line is open. David MacGregor : David, you talked about aggressively pruning bad businesses in Europe. I wonder if you could just go back and maybe dig in a little further there for us and give us a sense of what you have still on the books there that would be unprofitable business. What would that represent in terms of revenues and what would be the loss or the burden to the P&L right now? Dave Petratis : So if we said our mechanical side is 300 million it\u2019s 5% to 10% of that top-line. David MacGregor : And can you give us a sense of what it means at the operating line? Dave Petratis : So, first of all when we made the comment pruning bad business, it's not surely a business it's sale through to particular distributors or customers and that type of thing. So it\u2019s normally at a margin lower than what we realized for the full year this year, so call it basically a breakeven type of scenario. And would be baked in to our plan to get 10%, some of those are OEM commitments that you just don\u2019t get out of overnight. David MacGregor : And then I guess on the U.S. business you talk about organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%. You talk about slow and steady improvement in the US non-res construction business. In your 2015 guidance what are you assuming for non-res remodel growth? I wonder if you could just remind us again what the mix percentages are for new versus remodel in your non-res business. Dave Petratis : So we define the new construction in the commercial as where square footage is added. And so we think of that R&R it's 50% 55% of our top-line. As we think about that growth we see activity picking up over the next three years in that institutional new construction phase that will help us, but specifics in terms of that elements of growth don't have it at the top of my mind. David MacGregor : And then just a big picture question, I guess you have talked in the past about trying to grow your spec writing capacity. I guess I just wanted to check in with you and see if you are where you need to be at this point or where you may still have some work to do? Dave Petratis : We're strengthening our spec writing capability with tools that we believe that we're the leader in the market in terms of spec writing, so generally pretty comfortable with that. I think some of our competitors potentially are envious of our position, but our investments along that line are more in configuration tools that help us to be more efficient at serving that construction market. David MacGregor : Are there still feet on the street that you need to add, or are you satisfied with where you are there? Dave Petratis : We're satisfied our investments will be in the management of the channel, making sure that our through stock businesses in the local markets are meeting the expectations of a market leader. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Kessler of Imperial Capital. Your line is open. Jeff Kessler : With regard to the partnership with iDevices, we actually spent a long time with them at CES. Given iDevices close tie to Apple and home automation, what type of lock and non-lock wireless solutions could we expect from Allegion from this during 2015-2016? You don't have to give me the exact product, obviously, but the types of things you are going to be doing? Dave Petratis : Number one our Schlage Sense that will come out later in the year, well positioned to line up and serve that market. A couple of things as we thought about iDevices they've got some history working with Apple, we think we can learn from that. We think they can also benefit from some of our supply expertise. And then collaboratively sharing technology in this Internet-of-things if you would have noticed Jeff iDevices are coming out with some electrical switching, and it's indicative of this collaborative capability that we think is important to our core lock business. I think the other thing that you may have picked up at the Consumer Electronics Show was our partnering with Honeywell, Chamberlain, iDevices and others, we really believe that our products have to operate in a community of technologies and it will help us refine those roadmaps. Jeff Kessler : With regard to your development of your channel, you have been talking about a bifurcated area here. One, that you are trying to build or wait for pent-up demand coming out of the institutional market where you have been negotiating deals for some time now. Number two, developing a channel -- better channel capacity for the small business area. Can you talk about number one, because these are both areas where you have been under capacity in terms of number one, revenues in the institutional area? How are you developing the channel to pull that through? And number two, on the small business area, how are you developing the channel to pull that through? Dave Petratis : So and what we call the light commercial R&R we size that market let\u2019s say $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion and we believe we\u2019ve got a high single-digit market share and compare that to the presence that we have on new construction. It\u2019s apparent to us that we have to develop stronger channel policies, inventory requirement in the local market and work with our channel partners to get more of that through stock business to compliment what\u2019s already going through on a new construction basis. I like to think about it as we\u2019re flexing our muscle we should be getting more of that through stock in places like Miami or the Washington DC area. We\u2019re putting in the systems and processes to be able to get our share of that market which we think is naturally ours. Jeff Kessler : Does that also include working with distributors? Dave Petratis : Yes sir. Jeff Kessler : Okay. Dave Petratis : And potentially changing our lineup of distributors, I feel one of the strengths of Allegion when we win a major hospital job and we run that through wholesale distribution that allows us to require the stocking of inventory performance on small project jobs that will help us grow. Jeff Kessler : And also just to follow-up on that, my institutional question? Dave Petratis : Yes please. I may restate your institutional question please. Jeff Kessler : The institutional question, again just similar question in that there has been some pent-up demand in institutional business. It hasn't come through yet. You've been talking about negotiation now for probably about six months. Are we at a point now at which you are more positive for 2015 or 2016? Obviously the turnaround time on these negotiations are quite long, but that is out there and the question is how far do you think you are into that process? Dave Petratis : I\u2019m more positive on the improvement in institutional spending as we move into \u201915 and \u201916 and we\u2019ll talk about that at our Investor Day. Operator : Thank you. And the next last question is from Jeremie Capron of CLSA. Your line is open. Jeremie Capron : I wanted to go back to earlier questions on pricing. Could you talk about what you are seeing in the marketplace at this point and what are your expectations in 2015 in terms of potential price gains? Dave Petratis : So we had price increase announcements in the second half specifically around our commercial businesses in the Americas we felt we picked up traction in specifically late Q3 and Q4 and those will carry in. We still feel that it\u2019s a positive price environment it\u2019s going to be 1%-2% as we move through 2015. We think Europe will be difficult. Jeremie Capron : So within your overall 3% to 4% organic growth guide for 2015 you have more than one point of price gains in there? Dave Petratis : No, it\u2019s a little bit under 1% if you look at it across the globe, Americas specifically which is the lion share obviously a little bit under 1%. Jeremie Capron : And on the material cost side of things, metal prices are obviously coming down. Can you talk about what you are seeing and how you expect commodity prices to affect your cost base in 2015? Dave Petratis : Yes so if you look at our commodities the important ones would be steel, brass, zinc and aluminum. Steel you kind of look at the spot rate today relative to the average in 2014 I think very consistent. Brass which is a big spend for us is down so that would be beneficial, aluminum and zinc flat to little bit up. So collectively right now on basis of the spot rates, I would say kind of the same as 2014. We do hedge commodities in terms of supplier lock contracts, so it\u2019s not a financial hedge or instrument, so any further decrease in the spot rates would kind of come into our results over an extended period of time. Jeremie Capron : And maybe lastly on CapEx and R&D spend, obviously a significant step up in 2014 compared to previous years. What should we expect in 2015 in terms of CapEx intensity, I know you are running at about was it 2% to 2.5% of sales. Are we seeing more increases going forward and then similarly if you could comment around R&D dollar spend? Dave Petratis : So on the CapEx side you are right there was a big step up in 2015, 10 million of that 50 million in total spend, related to spin-related projects IT specific on a more normalized basis we're looking at 40 million per year which is our plan for 2015. And that would include IT spend associated with our ERP system, maintenance and NPD kind of programs, productivity et cetera. So I look at capital 40 million kind of a normalized level. One thing to keep in mind is this business and we get a recovery in the non-res area, we do not have significant capacity constraints that would require additional incremental capital expenditure. So feel pretty good that we can manage it at 40 million. In terms of R&D we stepped it up in '14, we're generally holding at that level into '15. If we see the opportunities are out there we'll invest but we'll inform you of that. Jeff Kessler : What about the effective tax rate? It looks like we are looking at a lower effective tax rate in 2015 than what you guys had in mind just a few months ago? Where do you think we ultimately settle say in 2016 or 2017? Dave Petratis : So I think aspirationally we've said aspirationally less than 20, if you go back 15 months ago I have got to reemphasize we didn\u2019t have a tax department. We've invested here and aggressively it's part of our corporate cost step up and it's delivered a good return. But we think long-term high-teens aspirationally could be possible. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Tom for closing remarks. Tom Martineau : Yes, and we just want to say thank you and appreciate everybody joining today's call and have a very safe day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes this today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

Welcome to the Allegion First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer-session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s presentation Mr. Tom Martineau, Director, of Investor Relations. Sir, please begin. Tom Martineau : Thank you, Howard. Good morning, welcome and thank for joining us for the first quarter 2015 Allegion earnings call. With me today is Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and the presentation which we will refer to you in today\u2019s call are available on our Web site at www.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our Web site. Please go to Slide Number 2. Statements made in today\u2019s call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results. The Company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Our release and today\u2019s commentary includes non-GAAP financial measures which exclude restructuring and spin expenses from prior year results. Excluded from the current quarter results is a remeasurement of monetary assets and inventory charge reflecting a change from the Venezuela SICAD II exchange rate to using the Venezuelan government\u2019s market-based SIMADI exchange rate. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details. Dave and Patrick will discuss our first quarter 2015 results, which will be followed by a Q&A session. For the Q&A we\u2019d like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and then reenter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone given the time allotted. Please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave Petratis : Thanks, Tom. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Allegion posted another solid quarter of organic revenue and EPS growth. We continue to make progress on our capital allocation plan and are beginning to realize the early benefits of our new product and channel initiative. Revenues of $458 million grew 5.9% on an organic basis. Total revenue declined 1.7% reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency. All regions posted positive organic growth. Of note, the Americas segment grew 7.7% organically driven by strength in the non-residential business. Adjusted operating income of $75.2 million, decreased 2.5% versus last year and as we mentioned in the previous earnings call, incremental investments were a headwind to margins in the first quarter which declined by 10 basis points. The investment impact was approximately 170 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.51 increased 15.9% versus the prior year driven primarily from improved operating performance and a lower effective tax rate offset by incremental investments in foreign exchange impact. This is our third straight quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 500,000 Allegion shares, which more than offset dilution related to incentive plans. We are affirming our full-year 2015 adjusted EPS guidance of $2.65 to $2.75 or $2.61 to $2.71 on a reported basis which reflects the first quarter Venezuelan devaluation charge that Tom mentioned previously. Please go to Slide 4. As you know opportunistic acquisitions is one of Allegion\u2019s five strategic pillars. Aligned with this we\u2019ve recently announced two acquisitions and I\u2019d like to welcome Zero International and Brio to the Allegion team. We remain focused on acquiring great businesses and these strategic acquisitions will expand our product portfolio and provide opportunity to expand globally. Zero International is a recognized leader in door and window products for commercial applications. These product lines include premium ceiling systems for sound control, fire and smoke protection, and threshold applications. The high-quality product portfolio from Zero expands our customer offerings which can be leveraged through our existing specification capability in channels. The acquisition of Brio expected to close in the second quarter at sliding and holding door hardware to Allegion\u2019s portfolio that provides opportunity to expand globally. Brio\u2019s suite of products include door hardware systems and accessories for interior sliding and folding doors, weather fold exterior folding doors, straight-sliding, top-hung and bottom-roller doors and retractable insect screens. We\u2019ve made significant progress in building the relationships and capability necessary to execute on our acquisition strategy. We continue to work the pipeline and are confident we are building this as a core competency. Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I will be back to discuss our full-year 2015 guidance. Patrick Shannon : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. Please go to Slide Number 5. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth in the first quarter as well as our growth by regional segments. As indicated, we delivered 5.9% organic growth in the first quarter, supported by incremental volume reflecting improving market fundamentals, modest price improvements, and early traction on our key organic investments in products and channels. We saw good growth across most product segments and continue to experience favorable traction on our electronic products portfolio. All segments reported positive organic revenue growth for the quarter. Currency rates continue to be a headwind to revenue growth as reflected by negative 7.4% decline. All reporting segments were impacted. Most notably, the weaker euro in EMEA and softer Canadian dollar and Venezuelan Bol\u00edvar devaluation impact in Americas results. In Asia-Pacific, the impact of weaker Australian, New Zealand dollars were offset by Prior year acquisition. As a result of unfavorable exchange rates, reported revenue decreased 1.7% compared to the prior year period. Please go to Slide Number 6. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $458.7 million. This reflects a decrease of 1.7% versus the prior year, up 5.9% on an organic basis. We realized 2.6% growth in the Americas, up 7.7% on an organic basis. U.S non-residential grew high single digits and residential segments X Venezuela increased low single digits. EMEA revenues were down 17.6% driven by currency headwind. Asia-Pacific revenues were up 3.2% with good traction on residential electronic locks. Adjusted operating income was $75.2 million, decreased 2.5% compared to the prior year. The decline was driven by increased investment spending in unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. Adjusted operating margin of 16.4% reflects a decrease of 10 basis points versus the prior year. This was expected for the first quarter and reflects the impact of incremental investments and currency rates already mentioned. Incremental investments made in the areas of new product development, channel and market expansion, and certain infrastructure programs had an impact of 170 basis points on the quarter. This headwind was largely offset by the favorable operating leverage on the increased volume. The impact of incremental investment comparisons get easier in the second half of the year. We are in the early stage of new product and channel initiatives and are very encouraged by the early feedback from the market. We continue to navigate the currency headwind, but still expect margin rates to improve in all regions for the full-year. Please go to Slide Number 7. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter of 2014, reported EPS was $0.38. Adjusting for prior year one-time separation and restructuring expenses of $0.06, the 2014 adjusted EPS was $0.44. Operational results increased EPS by $0.09 as pricing, productivity, and favorable operating leverage more than offset inflation. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate at 20.2% grow $0.06 per share improvement versus the prior year. Of note, we benefited from discrete tax items in the current quarter that were exchange rate related. We are forecasting these types of items to balance out on a full-year basis and accordingly are maintaining our effective tax rate guidance of 22%. Interest expense improvements from the credit facility amendment in 2014 added $0.01 and other net items added $0.01 primarily due to lower non-controlling interest expenses. Foreign exchange impacts reduced earnings by $0.04 due to the stronger U.S dollar compared to most currencies across the globe. Incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategies specific to taxes and M&A were $0.06 reduction. This results in adjusted first quarter 2015 EPS of $0.51 per share. Continuing on, we have a negative $0.04 per share reduction for the Venezuela devaluation charge to revalue monetary assets, the non-cash impairment charge to adjust Venezuelan inventory. After giving effect to these one-time items you arrive at the first quarter 2015 reported EPS of $0.47. Please go to Slide Number 8. First quarter revenues for the Americas region were $354.3 million, up 2.6% or an increase of 7.7% on an organic basis. Higher volumes and pricing compensated for unfavorable currency movements in Canada and Venezuela. The higher volume reflects solid results against a weak weather impacted 2014, but also steady non-residential improvement and better than market results with our new products and channel initiatives. Net favorable pricing reflects traction in the non-residential segment, offset by slightly unfavorable residential pricing driven by pricing adjustments to clear older generation product and make shelf space for our new electronic products and new merchandising connected to our style and design strategy. Americas adjusted operating income of $88.4 million, was up 2.1% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 10 basis points due to incremental investment spending which created a 150 basis point headwind in the quarter. The investments are related to the previously mentioned new products and channel development initiatives. Please go to Slide Number 9. First quarter revenues for the EMEA region were $81.7 million, down 17.6% and up 0.7% on an organic basis. Currency headwind continues to be a challenge in the region due to the softening euro and the Russian ruble, which impacts Eastern European sales. Solid results in Interflex hospitality in Turkey more than offset weakness in France and the soft Eastern European performance. EMEA adjusted operating income of $2.6 billion was up $1.4 million or 116.7% versus the prior year period on revenues that were down over 17%. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 200 basis points primarily due to favorable pricing and productivity that more than offset inflation, investment, and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. We are pleased with the ongoing improvement in this region, especially with increased currency headwinds and unfavorable sales mix due to lower Eastern European sales. The Company continues to target an operating margin of 10% in 2016 with our ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives, specific customer and market pricing actions in the elimination of unprofitable business. Please go to Slide Number 10. First quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $22.7 million, up 3.2%. Modest pricing and volume increases in the prior year acquisition more than offset unfavorable currency exchange rate movements. Residential electronic locks continue to grow in the region and the system integration pipeline supports the full-year outlook which is seasonally weighted to the second half of the year. Asia-Pacific adjusted operating income of negative $2.6 million was up 10.3% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 170 basis points due to incremental pricing, productivity, and the prior year acquisition of FSH which offset inflation and currency exchange impacts. As a reminder, the Asia-Pacific region historically loses money in the first quarter due to the seasonal nature of the business with the lowest revenues in the first quarter. Please go to Slide Number 11. Available cash flow for the first quarter of 2015 was negative $4.8 million, an improvement of $4.4 million compared to the prior year. The negative cash flow was typical of our historical performance reflects seasonal use of working capital. We continue to operate with an effective working capital structure and have realized that year-over-year improvement in working capital as a percent of revenue in every quarter since the spent. In addition, our cash conversion cycle improved 17% in the first quarter of 2015. We continue to guide full-year available cash flow of 95% of net earnings from continuing operations. Please go to Slide Number 12. As mentioned in our last call, the Venezuelan government announced changes to exchange rate system that introduced a new market-based system called the Marginal Currency System or SIMADI. We adopted the SIMADI rate after its introduction and recorded a charge of $7 million before tax and non-controlling interest were $0.04 per share. The charge includes remeasurement of net monetary assets of $2.8 million and non-cash impairment charge to adjust Venezuelan inventory balances of $4.2 million. Subsequent changes to the market-based SIMADI rate will flow through the income statement. However, at the current level of exchange, Venezuelan operating results are expected to have minimal impact to Allegion reported 2015 results. I'll now hand it back over to Dave for an update of our full-year 2015 guidance. Dave Petratis : Thanks, Patrick. Please go to Slide 13. Looking at full-year revenue guidance, we are increasing our organic growth expectations, but decreasing our overall revenue growth based on increased exchange rate headwinds. The incremental organic growth is from the Americas region and reflects continued optimism in 2015 markets and ongoing traction of our growth initiatives. We continue to monitor institutional market recovery, the given health of state budget surpluses and potential impacts of energy sector slowdown on construction markets; it's too early to call more than a moderate recovery for the year. Overall, inorganic revenue headwind in the Americas is unchanged, has a slight increase from the Zero acquisition offset to an increase in Canadian currency headwind. The most notable change in the EMEA region -- is the EMEA region, although organic projections remain unchanged, currency movements have created another six points of headwind. Inclusive of the revenue update, we are affirming our full-year adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $2.65 to $2.75 and reported EPS of $2.61 to $2.71, which incorporates the first quarter Venezuela devaluation impact of $0.04 per share. We continue to project full-year margin growth in all regions, with incremental operating leverage being used to support growth investments. Please go to Slide 14. Let me finish by reiterating that I was pleased with the first quarter results. We delivered organic revenue growth of 5.9%, held adjusted margins relatively flat while absorbing investments in currency pressure and grew EPS by nearly 16%. We are executing on our margin improvement efforts in Europe and continue to deliver a flexible and balanced capital allocation plan with both share repurchases and acquisitions announced in the quarter. And finally, we remain on track to deliver our original EPS guidance. Now Patrick and I\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of Robert Berry from Susquehanna. Your line is open. Robert Berry : Hey guys, good morning. Dave Petratis : Good morning, Rob. Patrick Shannon : Good morning. Robert Berry : Nice quarter. Congrats. Dave Petratis : Thank you. Robert Berry : David I wanted to just follow-up on your comments on the revised outlook for the Americas segment. I can certainly understand wanting to have some caution, but given the quarter you just put up I think to get to the midpoint of your revised organic growth range implies a pretty material slowdown in the volume for the next few quarters. So are you seeing evidence of some of those headwinds that you flagged as reasons for caution or just how are you thinking about the evolution of the core growth for the rest of the year in Americas? Thanks. Dave Petratis : So we are net positive as reflected in my comments on core growth. We see modest recovery in the institutional and commercial. We are cautioned by the weak GDP growth. We are mindful that recovery in our mind is capped by the available investment dollars, especially in institutional and capped by the amount of labor. So as we talked and evaluated on the year, we like to see another quarter and make any adjustments or save with our current guidance at that point. Patrick Shannon : Hey Robert, I'll just also add in the first quarter the comparisons were a little bit easier. You may recall last year of Q1 with the weather impact was a little bit softer. And so the 7.7% growth in Americas reflects a stronger year-over-year comparison, but also keep in mind seriously going forward we have pretty good growth last year Q3, Q4 around 5% in Americas. So the comparisons get a little bit more difficult. But as Dave indicated, a little caution here like the start to the year getting really good traction on our investments, particularly, in the channel lead business, discretionary market as well as some of the NPD initiatives. So feel good about that. Robert Berry : Okay. Fair enough. I will get back in the queue. Thanks. Dave Petratis : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Jeff Kessler from -- I'm sorry, next question or comment comes from the line of Timothy Wojs from RW. Baird. Your line is open. Timothy Wojs : Hi, guys. Good morning. Dave Petratis : Hi, Tim. Patrick Shannon : Good morning, Tim. Timothy Wojs : I guess, just -- the question for me is just on Americas on pricing. I think in the 10Q pricing was up a little bit on the top line, but it didn\u2019t cover inflation. So, I\u2019m just curious, is that due to timing just because wages went up a little bit more in the first? How should we think of the pricing and inflation dynamic this year? And then maybe just a little color on how you guys think about raw material inflation as we progress? Patrick Shannon : Yes, so on the pricing front as we had indicated last call, we\u2019re still anticipating little under 1% on pricing. Now you didn\u2019t see that full benefit in the quarter accelerate a little bit in the back half of the year, but getting pretty good traction on the non-residential products. It\u2019s the residential side that we commented was a little softer than anticipated and some of that is just moving out older product to make room for the high demand of our new electronic products, so a little pressure from that. Relative to your inflation question you\u2019re exactly right, I mean in the commodity area, steel, brass, copper, zinc, all the things inputs are going to our products, seen a decline year-over-year. We\u2019re not yet seeing the full impact of that, because as part of our policy we lock into suppler hedge contracts and so, we look out 12 months and we kind of hedge some of that. So, you\u2019d see some more that in the back half of the year. But potentially it\u2019s some upside if the prices stay where they are today. Timothy Wojs : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Patrick Shannon : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Jeff Kessler from Imperial Capital. Your line is open. Jeff Kessler : Thank you. See I made it in this time. Thank you. Can you get a little more granular on the investments that you\u2019re making particularly in the Americas with regard to both building up the channel, and your channel investments as to which way that is going as well as a traction or any new product introductions that you\u2019re coming out within the -- in the spear of the NPD technology area, and if that is going to be addition additive to revenues or will there be some cannibalization this year? Dave Petratis : Yes, so you may recall just from a -- just to recalibrate everyone we did reflect our Analyst Day incremental investments year-over-year full year basis, $0.15 to $0.20 and you saw $0.06 headwind in Q1 relative to the prior year period. The majority of that is Americas related probably two third, the remaining one third would be tied to our corporate, what we call infrastructure investments tied back to our M&A building capability, taxes, systems, those type of things. As it relates specific to Americas, I\u2019d say two thirds probably NPD related on both residential and non-residential products. One third being channel, related to this discretionary market which we think is a huge upside for us in the future. If you relate that relative to the benefits we\u2019re seeing, I would say in the organic revenue growth for Americas which was close to 8% for the quarter, you\u2019re probably getting one to two points tied back to those specific initiatives. So, I think pretty good traction really on that should hopefully accelerate. We like what we\u2019re seeing in the market place. So, on a full year basis I would see that maybe improving a little bit, but getting good I\u2019d say return from those investments. Patrick Shannon : I would add from a new product standpoint we will continue to rollout products that complement our ENGAGE technology and that communication interface, connected interface complements our strong mechanical base and then announced rollouts August, September in the residential space along connectivity. Jeff Kessler : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Jeremie Capron from CLSA. Your line is open. Grace Lee : Hi, this is Grace Lee sitting in for Jeremie Capron. We have two questions. One is, it\u2019s nice to see some acquisitions in Asia. Can you give us an update on acquisition pipeline there, and also we\u2019re wondering how this ongoing acquisition would impact the margin improvement initiatives in the region? The second question is about, 1% to 2% organic growth you just mentioned which is tied to the channel initiative. I\u2019m just wondering whether that\u2019s to do with the initiative of growing the U.S. repair and retrofit initiative. Dave Petratis : So, after quarterly review we took time to access our success on the acquisition pipeline. I\u2019d remind you that when we created the company we\u2019re dormant, more active globally and pleased with the progress and investments that we\u2019re driving. The Brio acquisition is from the Asia Pacific region we see great opportunities to leverage that hardware capability globally in warm weather climates that use accordion style doors. We see the pipeline opportunities in Asia continue to build as we develop the relationships in that are important to be successful in building the successful acquisition plan. So, very pleased with that progress. Second. Patrick Shannon : So, relative to your question on the margin, so the acquisition of Brio would lift the margin in that region. It hasn\u2019t closed yet. We do anticipate it\u2019s a close in Q2. So you\u2019d start seeing some of that improvement hopefully in the back half of the year. I mean there is integration cost and step up of inventory. It has a little pressure this year, so not a significant impact. But clearly in 2016, it operates at a much higher margin, so it would weigh favorably to the overall Asia Pacific results. And last one, the one to two points in the channel and new product, channel initiatives included in that. Dave Petratis : So two observations on channel development. Our highest priority is in the Americas, specifically the U.S. We see opportunities to be -- to grow organically in the light commercial R&R space. We saw traction in that in Q1, and it benefited us. But as we sharpen our channel strategies we\u2019re leveraging that learning into the Asia Pacific region in Europe. We think there is good opportunity to bring good channel management techniques to the company that will unleash growth opportunities in the regions we operate. Grace Lee : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning guys. Dave Petratis : Hi, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : I guess I have a question on Americas margins, but maybe to help frame it up. Dave Petratis : Josh, get closer to the phone. Josh Pokrzywinski : Sorry. Can you hear me now? Dave Petratis : Louder, clearly, but go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : All right. Will try that. Dave Petratis : Perfect. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just before we -- I had a question on Americas margins, but I guess that maybe to help frame, you guys gave the mix between more the retrofit versus institutional on the non-resi side in the quarter? Dave Petratis : So, not a big impact on the mix associated with that incremental volume for the quarter. Josh Pokrzywinski : Okay. So just based on some of the investment spend, it looks like you guys converted the revenue growth, call it about 45% in 1Q, 45% incrementals if you back out in investment. It doesn\u2019t sound like you got a lot of price in the quarter clearly seasonally not a lot of volume through the business. Is there something else that\u2019s helping drive the incrementals or should we think of this as where we\u2019re functionally at based on where the mix of the business is today? Dave Petratis : So, I want to make sure I understand your question. You\u2019re questioning the incremental leverage at 45% whether that\u2019s sustainable going forward? Josh Pokrzywinski : Right, because it looks like mix could actually get better from here. It doesn\u2019t look like there was anything too crazy and then, price was pretty anemic. So presumably there is some room for expansion there as well. Dave Petratis : Right. So, as reflected, the 45% see through pretty good leverage there. I would expect that to continue. As we indicated should see more favorable pricing going forward. We do have the incremental investments that will continue to be a headwind. Comparisons get easier in the back half of the year. We are still forecasting Americas margins improvement for the full year. So, as the investment headwind kind of comes down, then you see margin improvement. The other thing, if you\u2019re looking at it just from a margin perspective, don\u2019t forget Venezuela is weighing, I wouldn\u2019t say heavily but it weighing on the mix relative to the margin and even with that headwind we\u2019re seeing margin improvements. So if you look at ex-Venezuela there is pretty good margin improvement maybe 100 basis points or so. Josh Pokrzywinski : Terrific. All right. Thanks, I\u2019ll get back in queue. Dave Petratis : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Your line is open. Peter Lennox-King: This is Peter Lennox-King on for Steve. Could you talk a little bit about how momentum progressed through Q1 on the sales through in these regions and then I know you don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, but maybe if you could just give an indication on how that momentum progressed into and through April what you\u2019re seeing so far? Dave Petratis : So I\u2019d classify momentum in the resi space. We saw good traction in growth and what we call work probuild [ph] which supports new construction. We saw some softness in the repair and replacement on the resi side and weather impacts that. I think the South West United States in the resi market continues to be high, predictably from the weather standpoint in North East which is a good market for us with frozen. On the commercial institutional side, I would describe a generally good lift in all markets. As you think about the institutional builds, a lot of that traction gets moving in Q1 for summer activities especially in schools, universities that type of thing, and then you\u2019ve got your normal project load. We see a step up there in resi reflected in our optimism. Hospitals under pressure, again a step up in the institutional and we\u2019re seeing traction in our development of the channel expansion that we want to influence in the commercial R&R. And that\u2019s probably stronger in some targeted markets. And as we roll out that full program, expect similar results. Peter Lennox-King: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Charles Clarke from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Charles Clarke : Hi, guys. Dave Petratis : Charlie. Charles Clarke : I just had a quick question probably can't make specific comments on it, but just a headline this morning that the merger between Kaba and Dorma or at least the announcement. Just didn\u2019t know if how that maybe changes the industry or how that changes your M&A outlook or, just anything that you could kind of talk about with respect to that? Dave Petratis : So we certainly caught that this morning, analyzing it. We\u2019ve got great respect for Kaba and Dorma, we\u2019ve known then over the years. It\u2019s I think a strong reflection of a consolidating industry. It remains heavily fragmented as we\u2019ve talked about in our analyst presentations. And the strength of that merger is really outside of the United States and it\u2019s a clear indicator that as we think about capital deployment, if there is good assets to bring into our portfolio we\u2019re interested and we continue to work on it, so more to come on that as we evaluate the news in the morning. Patrick Shannon : And I would just add Charlie, it doesn\u2019t change our strategy. We\u2019ll continue to execute and you saw good traction in Q1. We have a lot of organic growth opportunities particularly in Americas. We\u2019re continuing to get good improvement in European margins, all that doesn\u2019t change and we\u2019re going to continue to drive shareholder value through our organic growth initiatives, things we can control and as Dave said, continue to be aggressive on the capital allocation plan. Charles Clarke : Okay, thanks. Just a quick one just on growth, for the quarter, I mean 7% Americas is a big number, so its low single digits residential, high single digits non-residential. Has institutional -- is institutional growing institutional specifically, was that up in the quarter? Dave Petratis : Positive indicators, I would classify it as low to mid single digits. We\u2019re going to do well in any kind of recovery in that space. But again, capped by labor the ability to install it and I think our bigger opportunities is pursuing our channel base strategies that gets us a bigger share of the existing market. As I said, in any type of recovery we\u2019ll do extremely well in the Americas. Charles Clarke : Thanks a lot, guys. Dave Petratis : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment is a follow-up from Mr. Robert Berry from Susquehanna. You line is open. Robert Berry : Thanks for taking the follow-up. Actually we did want to follow-up on the pricing comment earlier. I think some of the benefit you saw in commercial was being offset by the resi as you mentioned. Is that temporary, it sounded like it might be temporary if you\u2019re clearing out inventory and how much did that weigh on kind of the net pricing in the quarter? Dave Petratis : Yes, so I would say it\u2019s temporary through perhaps this quarter, might see some softness as well as those programs continue. How much did it weigh, maybe 30 basis points or so. Patrick Shannon : From a business perspective, driving your style and design which means some inventory switch out and we\u2019ve got new products entering the market from resi electronic standpoint which we think is good opportunity for us as that market converges. Robert Berry : Right. So, I guess that yes, so that that 30 BIP should elevate as a headwind? Dave Petratis : Correct. Patrick Shannon : And let me just add something here too, maybe as a point of clarification. When we look at pricing impact its similar products year-over-year, when we\u2019re up selling so with our replacement of the new electronic products, as we talked about before it comes at a higher price point which adds revenue dollars, that\u2019s not captured in the year-over-year price improvement. So that would be captured in volume. And so the replacement does have a positive impact in terms of higher price point and as well as because the margins are similar higher OI dollars. Robert Berry : Okay, perfect. And if I could also just quickly follow-up on the remaining investment spending, $0.15 to $0.20, $0.06 in the quarter, the remaining call it $0.09 to $0.14. Is that going to be evenly spread over the remaining three quarters or is that weighted in some way to second quarter? Dave Petratis : Its\u2019 more heavily weighed Q2, Q3; Q4 falls off significantly. So there is minimal impact in Q4. Robert Berry : Great. Thanks, guys. Patrick Shannon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment is a follow-up from Mr. Jeff Kessler from Imperial Capital. Your line is open. Jeff Kessler : Thank you for taking the follow-up. You\u2019ve talked about taking your Venezuelan exchange rates to the official SIMADI rate. You obviously are aware that the black market rate or the street rate is, remains quite different than what anything the government has been able to say for the last -- actually this is consistent for the last two years. But this time we know the vision is that disparity is getting pretty big. What do you do to monitor that and how are you -- how can you manage against that, the fact that we have got something like, I\u2019d say its more like 170 to 1 at this point as opposed to 50 or 60 to 1? Dave Petratis : I believe our current thinking of the business we\u2019re up in almost 200 to 1, 192. I think second if you look at what's left on the balance sheet, there\u2019s not a lot of risk there, and we\u2019re reflecting on our long-term position in Venezuela in considering our option. Jeff Kessler : Okay. Patrick Shannon : Jeff, even to add a little more clarity, I think any political solution in Venezuela is going to take years. And the amount of time we spend at that just trying to explain it is a distraction with the overall impact it has on the business. Jeff Kessler : Yes, I mean I\u2019m just trying to -- I\u2019m just trying to dispose of this as something that you have to think about every quarter, it may -- that becomes less and less meaningful but you still -- its still like there\u2019s bug in the back of your head. Dave Petratis : Yes. Jeff Kessler : All right. Thank you very much. Dave Petratis : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open. Dave Petratis : Hi, Jeff. Brett Linzey : Stepping in for, Jeff. Hey this is, Brett. Hey, I just wanted to come back on the investment spending. It sounds like you guys are getting a pretty quick payback there on the new products in some of the refresh. Should we think of 2015 as really kind of a one time refresh across the portfolio? And how should that play out as we think about the model into 2016? I mean, has it become kind of a permanent fixture of the cost space or did some of that go away? Dave Petratis : Yes, so as we talked about during the Analyst Day, you need to think about the incremental investments for both 2014, 2015 being a step up in the cost space, i.e. things like NPD, a lot of engineering spend associated with that will stay in the cost. However looking forward into 2016 beyond those level of incremental investments comes down. I think there would still be some as we continue to find growth alternatives organically. And then you may recall with the payback and the returns on those investments EBITDA margin growth starts to out pay significantly the incremental investment spend. And so, look at it as an increase in the cost space, but the level of year-over-year incremental spend coming down beginning in 2016. Brett Linzey : Okay, great. Yes, that\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s all I had. Dave Petratis : Yes. End of Q& A Operator : Thank you. I\u2019m showing no additional questions in the queue at this time. I\u2019ll turn it back over to management for closing remarks. Tom Martineau : Hi, again we\u2019d like to thank everyone for participating in today's call. Feel free to contact me for any further questions. Have a safe day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

Please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave Petratis : Thanks Tom, good morning and thank you for joining us today. It has been an exciting quarter for Allegion. Since the last time we spoke we've announced three more acquisitions and communicated further steps in our European transformation. But most importantly, we continued to deliver solid results in line with our communicated growth strategy and financial expectations. Revenues of $519 million grew 5.8$ on an organic basis. Total revenue declined 2.3% reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency. The Americas segment grew 7.2% organically driven by strength in both nonresidential and residential businesses. In EMEIA market recovered continues to be uneven across countries and organic revenues are relatively flat as expected. In our Asia Pacific region organic growth of 7.7% was supported with contributions from the hardware businesses and the inclusion of previously announced acquisition of Brio. Adjusted operating income of $101.2 million was relatively flat to prior year. We realized operating margin expansion in all regions for the quarter and improved overall margins by 40 basis points. It is important to remember that we're showing margin improvements while absorbing incremental investments. Investments predominantly in new product and channel initiatives created 140 basis point headwind in the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.71 increased 16.4% versus the prior year driven primarily from improved operating performance and a lower tax rate partially offset by incremental investments in foreign exchange impact. This is our four straight quarter with double-digits earning per share growth. We are raising our full year 2015 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $2.70 to $2.80 per share. Please go to slide 4. As you are aware one of Allegion's core strategies is to grow through strategic acquisitions. Our strategy has been focused on opportunities that fill certain product gaps, expand our business geographically, provide new innovative technologies that can be leveraged across the business and provide solid financial returns. Since the spin we have been actively building our capabilities, developing [indiscernible] process and expanding our pipeline of opportunities. Since the last earnings release, we announced three acquisitions that are an excellent fit with our core business, expand our product and geographical footprint and provide exciting accelerated growth opportunities. In June we entered into an agreement to acquire SimonsVoss a leading electronic lock manufacturer that hold the number one market position in Germany and number two, market position in Europe with a track record of innovation product development that complements Allegion's growth strategy. SimonsVoss is not just a forerunning. This company is a pioneer setting standards for connected products like digital cylinders and smart handles. By adding SimonsVoss to the Allegion business we are expanding our electronic portfolio in the European market as well as strengthening our global technology in electromechanical conversion and miniaturization. Just last week we made two more acquisition announcements starting with Milre Systek. Milre is the market leading manufacturer in South Korea focusing on producing high quality in innovative electronic security solutions including mortise, rim and cabinet locks. Milre has a well established cadence of operational excellence which is also highly aligned with Allegion's growth [ph] strategy. Combined with this culture of continuous improvement and technical innovation Milre offers superior quality digital products and creates lasting relationships in the industry that will enhance Allegion's portfolio in South Korea and other Asian markets. And finally last week we announced the acquisition of Axa Stenman, a leading European residential and portable security provider headquartered in the Netherlands. Founded in 1902 Axa manufacturers and sells a branded portfolio of bicycle locks and lights and a wide variety of window and door hardware. Joining the Allegion family will enhance Axa;s deep local heritage and create more meaningful growth opportunities through innovative product development across Europe and globally. Axa's portable security portfolio is highly synergetic with our kryptonite business, allowing the two brands to leverage one and another's extensive customer and channel relationship and product development. Axa Stenman also provides a highly profitable position in the residential security arena in the Dutch market with opportunities to expand into Poland and German markets. In 2015 Axa is expected to generate double-digit revenue growth. All of these transactions are expected to close in the third quarter subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. We're very excited to welcome these businesses, brains and employees to the Allegion family. Please go to slide 5. Allegion is on the cutting edge in the security sector with the internet of things. We recognized early that the smartphone would be a disruptive innovation in security and have certainly become an essential part of creating a responsive environment and managing access. As TechWatch recently noted, the connected term really took hold when Schlage entered the market with its keyless Schlage link lock in 2009. We followed up in 2014 with the launch of Engage Technologies for the commercial market. And in the first quarter of this year Allegion availed Schlage Sense solution for Apple HomeKit while in the second quarter we announced Schlage Control for managing multifamily buildings. All these connected solutions make Schlage locks a prevalent entry point for home and office automation. Consider these results. We have the leading security position in retail with channel players like Home Depot, Lowes and Maynard's [ph]. We are anticipating to sell 1 million electronic locks in 2015. A leading consumer publication recently ranked Schlage locks number one in both keyless locks and connected locks. Allegion is a clear thought leader with a strong share of voice on security solutions in the Internet of things. What's driving these results? We believe three unique advantages drive our success in this space. First, Allegion has key partnerships in place with companies like Apple, Chamberlain, Seaboard [ph] and iDevices among others. This collaboration expands our footprint and expedites adoption of security products. Second, our leading position across residential multifamily and commercial markets in the U.S. gives Allegion the experience and vision to recognize trends and customer needs very early. We moved very quickly to adapt technology and spread it into new markets, new businesses and new applications. Third, thanks to our worldwide engineering and operations we continue to invest, development and support global platforms and open standards. This gives us extraordinary flexibility and adaptability to meet and exceed expectations of both industry professionals and consumers alike. Allegion had an early commitment to Internet of Things and today we see dividends of our leadership in this dramatic high growth space. Before I turn the call over to Patrick I want to provide some comments with regard for our European transformation. We have seen positive results from the work done by our team in the region under the leadership of L\u00facia Moretti. The transformation is changing the way EMEIA does business. The team is focusing its efforts on developing comprehensive solutions for verticals in enhancing specific capabilities across the region. This approach creates demand and additional customer value. There are also for simplifying and streamlining systems and processes to better service customers and then becoming into more agile organization. Last the EMEIA team is optimizing its assets to drive enterprise excellence. In the second quarter Allegion a announced its intention to implement a restructuring plan in CISA's Italian operations, the objectives of this plan in line with the region's overall transformation is to improve CISA's competitive position, ensure long-term viability and enhance the customer experience. Negotiations are currently underway and we are working to find the best possible solution for the people affected in accordance with the social parties involved. Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2015 guidance. Patrick Shannon : Thanks Dave and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. Please go to slide number six, this slide depicts components of our revenue growth in the second quarter as well as our growth by regional segment. As indicated we delivered 5.8% organic growth in the second quarter, supported by incremental volume that reflects improving market fundamentals, price improvements and early traction on our key organic growth investments and products and channels. We've realized good growth across most product segments and continue to experience favorable traction on our electronic products portfolio which improved more than 20%. As expected currency rates continue to be a headwind to revenue growth noted by the negative 9.3% decline. All reporting segments were impacted, most notably, the weaker euro in EMEIA, softer Canadian dollar and Venezuela Bolivar devaluation and impact in the Americas results. In Asia-Pacific the impact of weaker Australia and New Zealand dollars were offset by acquisitions in the region. As a result of unfavorable exchange rates reported revenue decreased 2.3% compared to the prior year period. Please go to slide number seven. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $519.5 million. This reflects a decrease of 2.3% versus the prior year up 5.8% on an organic basis. Americas' revenue grew 0.3% up 7.2% on an organic basis. U.S. nonresidential and residential segments provided balanced growth. EMEIA revenues were down 17.1% driven primarily by currency headwinds. Asia-Pacific revenues were up 13.2% with good traction in residential electronic locks and contributions from acquisitions. Adjusted operating income of $1.2 million was essentially flat compared to the prior year. Incremental volume leverage compensated for increased investment spending. Adjusted operating margin of 19.5% reflects an increase of 40 basis points versus the prior year. Incremental investments made in the areas of new product development, channel and market expansion, and certain infrastructure programs had an impact of 140 basis points on quarter. The impact of incremental investment comparisons get easier in the second half of the year particularly in the fourth quarter. We are in the early stage of new products and channel initiatives and are encouraged by the early feedback from the market. We continue to navigate the currency headwind, but still expect margin rates to improve in all regions for the full year. Please go to slide number eight. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter 2014 reported EPS was $0.53. Adjusting for prior year one-time separation and restructuring expenses of $0.08 the 2014 adjusted EPS was $0.61. Operational results increased EPS by $0.11 as pricing, productivity and favorable operating leverage more than offset inflation. As noted on the chart this includes a favorable $0.01 per share related to a reduction in year-over-year bad debt adjustments in the Asia-Pacific region. The decreased in adjusted effective tax rate of 22.3% drove $0.09 improvement versus the prior year. Interest expense improvements from the credit facility amendment in 2014 added a penny and other net items were $0.02 reduction primarily due to unfavorable currency exchange losses and related expenses. Next incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategy specific the taxes and IT investments were $0.05 reduction. And lastly the net year-over-year impact of Venezuela at current exchange rates is a core cent reduction. This results in adjusted second quarter 2015 EPS of $0.71 per share. Continuing on we have a negative $0.05 per share reduction for restructuring and acquisition expenses. After giving effect to these one-time items you arrive at the second quarter 2015 reported EPS of $0.66.  Please go to slide number nine. Second quarter for the Americas region were $402.1 million up 0.3% or an increase of 7.2% on organic basis. Higher volumes, pricing and contribution from the acquisition of Zero compensated for unfavorable currency movements in Canada and Venezuela. The higher volumes reflect balanced organic growth in both residential and nonresidential markets as well as electronics growth exceeding 20% with strong contributions from both residential and nonresidential products. This reflects better than market performance driven by new products and channel initiatives. Americas' adjusted operating income of $11.9 million was up 0.9% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 10 basis points while absorbing incremental investment spending that created a 70 basis point headwind in the quarter. Please go to slide number 10. Second quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $83.9 million down 17.1% and down 0.3% on an organic basis. Currency headwind continues to be a challenge in the region due to the softening euro and the Russian ruble which impacts Eastern European sales. Slightly lower organic volume was offset by favorable pricing and net acquisition contributions. Electronics growth was also strong in the region. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $4.3 million was up $2.2 million or 104.8% versus the prior year period on revenues that were down more than 17%. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 300 basis points primarily due to favorable pricing and productivity that more than offset inflation, investment and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. Our EMEIA results continue to improve and we continue the transformation work that not only reshapes and resizes the business, but also scales the business for strategic acquisitions. The company continues to target an operating margin of 10% for the base business in 2016 through ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives, specific customer and market pricing actions and the elimination of unprofitable business. Please go to slide number 11. Second quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $33.5 million up 13.2%. Improved residential electronic lock growth pricing and the impact of acquisitions more than offset unfavorable currency exchange rate movements. Asia-Pacific adjusted operating income of negative $1.4 million was up $1.9 million or 57.6% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 690 basis points due to incremental pricing, productivity and acquisitions, which offset inflation and currency exchange impacts. Results also reflect a year-over-year improvement in bad debt adjustments of $1.2 million. Please go to slide number 12. Year-to-date available cash flow for 2015 was $14.8 million a reduction of $24.6 million compared to the prior year period. The reduction in year-over-year cash flow is due to increased operating cash requirements offset by increased earnings and reduced capital expenditures. And as you know available cash flow for the business is very seasonal and the majority of our available cash flow is generated in the second half of the year. We continue to operative with an effective working capital structure and have realized a year-over-year improvement in working capital as a percentage of revenue in every since the spin. In addition our cash conversion cycle continues to improve with more than a 20% reduction in the second quarter 2015. We continue to guide full year available cash flow 95% of net earnings from continuing operations which reflect some one-time tax related cash expenditures. I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full-year 2015 guidance. Dave Petratis : Thank you, Patrick. Please go to slide 13. Looking at full-year revenue guidance we are increasing our growth expectations for the year by a full point. We are increasing total revenue expectations in the Asia-Pacific region by 3% reflecting the inclusion of the Brio acquisition, partially offset by additional currency headwinds in Australia and New Zealand. In the Americas we are improving total revenue by 1% supported by first half organic growth and favorable contributions from new product and channel initiatives. We continue to project year-over-year improvements in the U.S. markets. Institutional markets continue to grow slowly with improvement in higher education markets while K-12 education continued to lag driven by modest state funding increases. Our outlook for institutional recovery remains favorable, although we are watching labor availability that may struggle to meet demand in the midterm. Residential construction markets continue to grow as inventory continues to tighten. Foreclosure rates are at the highest since 2006 and mortgage rates continue to remain low. However, builders are facing challenges with land availability and labor shortages. Our revenue outlook remains unchanged for the EMEIA region. I would characterize the market as stable overall, but uneven across countries. We see growth in the U.K. and Spain, flat performance in Italy, [Audio Gap] offset new construction and continued weakness in France. The Russian ruble depreciation is driving negative revenue growth for our Eastern European business as imports into that region have declined considerably. In Asia Pacific we continue to expect favorable growth across the region and see China slowing due to excessive debt and industrial capacity glut and ongoing real estate recession. Australia's residential construction market has been positive but commercial construction continues to lag expectation. Market growth for the overall Asia Pacific region will remain in the low to mid single-digits for the year. Inclusive of the revenue update we are updating our full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations to a range of $2.70 to $2.80 and the reported EPS of $2.51 to $2.63, which incorporates the first quarter Venezuelan devaluation incurred, acquisition expenses in the second quarter and full year estimated expenses related to the announced restructuring plan in Italy. The guidance does not reflect announced acquisitions not yet closed. Please go to slide 14. The second quarter results were very strong and represented solid growth with a 5.8% organic revenue increase, a 40 basis point margin expansion and EPS growth of over 16%. Our markets are essentially as we expected at the beginning of the year and we continue to make progress on new product introductions in our channel initiatives. Our results demonstrate alignment with our strategic growth pillars and we continue to expand our acquisition capability as indicated in our recent announcements. Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jeff Kessler from Imperial Capital. Your line is now open. Jeff Kessler : Thank you. You talked about and you stressed several times your commitment to open standards. Not everybody in the industry you know, not every industry is taking that tact. And I'm wondering where you think you have competitive advantage, competitive perhaps and it may be some admitted disadvantage in opening up your APIs as well as sticking to NFC 111 form of wireless as opposed to going out and spreading your wings and doing about three or four ones? Dave Petratis : So Jeff, we've got major competitors that you know that have formidable positions in the marketplace with technology. We think moving into the market with open platforms helps us to grow more quickly. We also as we listen and survey customers, customers in the security space as well as the electrical space that I come from do not want to be handcuffed by legacy systems. And as we can integrate more open protocols we think it's a better way to grow and ultimately it will end up that way. So that's our perspective. Our technical people have more insight to it, but in my viewing if technology advanced in some of the year open platforms I think enhances our opportunity for growth. Jeff Kessler : Okay, one followup question. In Europe you basically laid out three bullet points for how you're going to grow, basically enhancing specialist capabilities, looking at verticals and optimizing your assets. Could you elaborate on that, give a little more detail on what you are going to do, what you are doing in Europe and where you think you're in terms of numbers which you can gain out of that over the next 18 months toward the end of 2016 when you have that goal of 10%? Dave Petratis : So, we continue to be committed on the base business the 10%, I think hopefully we're building credibility with you in terms of where we came from. The trajectory has been good. Second, a core opportunity for us is to get our structure right in our announcements in Italy and our work with the union processors in that direction. Third is around targeted segmented markets we're doing well in electronics and hospitality that's part of our overall 20% growth in electronics and we think the addition of SimonsVoss and AXA helps us to drive that. SimonsVoss I'll comment on in particular, SimonsVoss has done extremely well in Germany, in the Germanic area, the influence markets. We think our positions Italy, Spain, U.K., France open doors to that and can help us to take a market that we think is going to be difficult from a macro standpoint to grow and improve. Jeff Kessler : Is SimonsVoss a platform for you, for these others to work off of given their reputation or is this going, or are you continuing to build a portfolio, in other words what is the base and what's the portfolio here? Dave Petratis : I believe SimonsVoss allows us the opportunity to walk in to a specifier and drive a spectrum in technical discussion and will allow us to pull through more of our historical product strengths, exit devices, closers whatever. We blacked that and it really changes the game. Jeff Kessler : All right, great, and thank you very much and congratulations on these acquisitions and gradually to Franklin [ph] over the there. Dave Petratis : We are proud of him. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning gentlemen. Dave Petratis : Good morning. Jeff Sprague : So, just coming back to M&A, I really strategically get and understand SimonsVoss. It looks like you can do a lot with that, but thinking about bicycle locks and locker locks and things like that, I mean maybe that makes sense financially given where your multiple is and maybe that's just where your head is, but how do you really make anything strategic out of those type of acquisitions? Dave Petratis : So, I'm confident you're aware of our position with Kryptonite. We like that business. We had to, to grow kryptonite, especially in Europe we are going to have to make investments to grow that in some of the markets that Axa brings. As I think about portable locking, it will again move into a keyless environment in a percentage of those locks. We like that transition and you know, I like to drive our teams here. Can we be a global leader in portable locking. This is a bigger market than you may anticipate. So the movement with Axa Stenman complements that and that would be some of our thinking in terms of that acquisition. Jeff Sprague : I mean, do you have an active pipeline in that area then from this point forward? Dave Petratis : Our pipeline across the business is active. You know, that would include portable locking, that would include further electronics and geographical expectations. I think what we showed with the three announcements is, really starting with the Dorma acquisition pipeline, this $30 billion mechanical market remains fragmented and there's opportunities for us to move and complement our portfolio that we enjoy today. Jeff Sprague : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs from Baird. Your line is now open. Timothy Wojs : Hey guys, good morning. Dave Petratis : Hi Tim. Timothy Wojs : I guess, so my question, it's a couple parts, but it really focuses on the acquisitions. So, I guess first just a piece of acquisition seems to be accelerating, I guess is that emblematic of just how robust the pipeline or was it just really kind of chalked up to timing and then based on our math, I mean you're increasing your revenue base in Europe by probably 50% and you're doing some restructuring there, so just how confident are you in your ability to tie together two larger deals plus, kind of perform the restructuring in Europe? And then lastly, just any sort of financial update on the acquisitions in terms of how we should think about annualized EPS accretion or margin profiles of the businesses you're acquiring? Patrick Shannon : Yes, so three questions there. I'll try to take them in order. You know, in terms of the pipeline, as Dave mentioned since the spin, it's been all about building capabilities, getting resources focused on building the pipeline. I think we've done a pretty good job at that and have been able to complete some transactions here. You know, I think the last three announced transactions in the last 30 days or so is more a factor of just kind of availability, two of which were auctioned assets and so those come and go and add some flows and that type of a thing, but we continue to build the pipeline and we like what we see. We think there are some more opportunities that we would like to pursue and we are going to continue to do that. In terms of our confidence relative to the integration of the acquisitions, yes the team there is working on a lot of things, not only the transformation of the business, but also staffing up to integrate the acquired businesses. I like our opportunities there. I think we got a great team in place there as well as the employees that we've acquired from the businesses. From an integration perspective we've got a fairly disciplined process. We are going to hire external assistance, third-party provider that will help us accelerate the process to really focus on the value drivers and the synergies attached to the acquisitions. We've got teams in place and we're beginning to work on the necessary activities to integrate the businesses. So I feel pretty good there, in terms of how we're delegating the resources across the business to be able to tackle all of those opportunities. Dave Petratis : I would step in here too. You know, I really challenge myself, three acquisitions in the quarter, are we ready? If you think about the last 18 months, we spun out a $2 billion company, have established credibility with due systems processes. I'm confident we can handle these acquisitions that we've announced this quarter and future opportunities that may come based on what we've done and delivered over the last 18 months. Patrick Shannon : Your last question Tim, on the financials, our first focus obviously is to focus on getting the transactions closed, subject to regulatory approvals. The Milre deal hopefully will close here in the next week or so. The other ones we need to hear back from the regulators, hopefully before the end of this quarter and from an accretion perspective I would anticipate slight accretion for this year and then for 2016, obviously we'll come back to you with more specific guidance when we come out of our full year plan attached with those acquisitions. Timothy Wojs : Okay, great. Thanks for all the color, I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Steven Winoker : Thanks and good morning guys. I know you've talked about M&A a lot, but just may be one more clarification will be helpful which is just in aggregate I know you can't do it by deal, but in aggregate what's the earnings multiple, forward earnings multiple that you have paid for these? Patrick Shannon : Yes, so kind of low double digits, you know in aggregates. The other thing I had mentioned to you as well is that, if you kind of look again in aggregate, all five transactions, those that have been closed and announced, strong EBITDA margins, more of our industry-leading position in aggregate, strong cash flow characteristics i.e. low working capital CapEx requirements. So these fit into our core market-leading financial characteristics and we think they all provide excellent growth opportunities, particularly leveraging both of our strong distribution networks. Steven Winoker : And that's EBIT is low double digit EBITDA multiple, forward EBITDA multiples when you mention that right? Patrick Shannon : Yes. Steven Winoker : Okay, and then on strategy for China and Asia Pacific, just thinking about the improvement we saw in this quarter there, what's the go forward path there in terms of commitment, what are you seeing and to make that a more meaningful contributor, how long do we have to wait for that? Dave Petratis : So, first priority is to grow our mechanical core business in the region. Second is as we are acquiring, you see it's more of a Pacific rim that doesn't mean we wouldn't be interested in a Chinese based asset. We just think there's some sorting out there, the markets had some difficulty, but we are opportunistic in the region, it's around our core business. We think it's key and then integrate the electronics. They will also, the Milre acquisition what we're doing globally, the electronics is going to move there and be opportunistic in terms of that. Steven Winoker : Okay, I'll pass it on. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning guys. Dave Petratis : Hey Josh, good morning. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just a follow up on the accretion question, I know that obliviously you are going to have some true-ups when these things close, your timing, you're still waiting for approval and some things, but just to back into some of the numbers you threw out relative to your margins and prices paid, it seems like ongoing basis after close we're talking about $0.15 to $0.20 of accretion, just using the math you gave in the next year and throwing Europe on top of that, may be more like $0.30 of kind of self-help before organic growth, is that an unfair way to think about it or there's some other weeks in that that we're not aware of, is this part of the deal or part of the restructuring? Dave Petratis : No, I mean I think that characterizes it fairly good. You know, on the M&A stuff, you would think kind of mid single digit accretion next year which is kind of in the bandwidth of what you indicated. You know a lot can be dependent upon the final outcome of the purchase price allocation, but that's certainly within the realm of possibility. Josh Pokrzywinski : Great, and if I can just ask one followup on\u2026 Dave Petratis : Let me just follow-on comment, just so everyone is clear on that. So that would exclude acquisition and integration related expenses. So to the extent we incur additional one-time related costs, i.e. expenses for third party assistance, while it be integration or a third party cost to help complete the transaction, those costs will be excluded from those accretion numbers. Josh Pokrzywinski : Understood, that's helpful. And if I can just followup on something else you said earlier on price and productivity offsetting inflation this quarter in the Americas, presumably with metals coming in that should be more of a tailwind in the second half, both on actual inflation as maybe both of those turn positive, is that how you guys are seeing it in your build materials these days or is there some other timing issue, that's not apparent? Dave Petratis : So raw material commodities represent maybe 10% of our purchase material and obviously we see that from components from other suppliers. We don\u2019t see the immediate effect of reduction in commodity prices because we inherited supplier locks that hedge our cost kind of going out on a 12 month basis. Some of that is unhedged. So we see some, but not the immediate impact, but as we kind of look at the numbers for this year, deflation has helped us and we would expect that to kind of continue for the balance of the year. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got you. Thanks guys. Dave Petratis : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Charles Clark from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Charles Clark : Hi guys. Dave Petratis : Hi Charlie. Charles Clark : Just maybe change gears a little bit, just a question on European restructuring, just to know how the process was progressing, obviously if you could give an update on that? And then also just in the EMEIA region, I know that divestments of low-margin businesses are a part of the path to get to the 10% target would acquisitions like SimonsVoss would presumably have 20% plus margins, will that potentially be accretive or better than that 10% target, I am just wondering if that was part of the prior plan or is that kind of all new? Dave Petratis : So the labor negotiations are, it's really government labor negotiations in Italy are going as planned. I think we have done a good job to follow the process and then been inclusive with the important officials that are critical to make a process like this go correctly. Those are active, that\u2019s as far as I want to go with that. We want to make sure that we respect the institution and people and put the business in a comparative position long-term. Patrick Shannon : And your question related to the operating margins so the target has always been 10% base business kind of flat volume, that's still the objective. We\u2019re marching towards that. We have some more things that we need to execute. And relative to the acquisitions, yes they are accretive to the EMEIA, EBIT margins and you will see that come through when the transactions are consummated and particularly next year. Dave Petratis : I'll just reinforce that our commitment is to 10% with the base and I'm really proud of the progress we\u2019re making towards that. Charles Clark : Sounds good, great thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Berry from Susquehanna International Group. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning guys. This is Phillip following and I am on the call for Rob today. So my first question is on the pricing in Americas if you can comment on the pricing environment, the pricing improved from 0.3% to 0.6% and what\u2019s included in your 5% to 6% outlook? Dave Petratis : Yes, so pricing has improved year-over-year sequentially improved a little bit particularly in the commercial segment, saw a little step up there. We anticipated that to carry through for the balance of the year. It is the residential side of the house, that\u2019s been a little bit under pressure in a discontinuance of certain products and rotating in some of the electronic products that we talked about, so a little pressure there on the pricing. I would anticipate for the full year pricing to be little under 1% is kind of what we\u2019re anticipating for the full year guidance. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great and then if you can comment on the expense to with the strong double-digit growth in electronics contributed to the Americas' margin in 2Q? Dave Petratis : The strong residential growth if you remember we want new products D&D with Engage Technology, Schlage Sense. There is interest on the residential to the mid market and upper market, the want connected locks and we are in the A position there so that drives it. And then as we have invested in new technologies, whether it\u2019s in educational sector in dorms with our NDE, these markets are growing. I think we said early on they would be at 6% to 8% growth for electronics and that adoption is happening and we've got good products and technical application ability to be able to position it and we like our position. Patrick Shannon : Yes, from a margin perspective, as we outlined really good growth there, like the progress that we\u2019re seeing, both on the residential commercial side of the house. Margin standpoint, I would say it is very similar, but what we do see is higher selling point price and of course that would contribute to higher arrive dollars. So the trend in terms of growth rates in electronics versus mechanical is a good one and one that we want to continued to spend. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremie Capron from CLSA. Your line is now open. Jeremie Capron : Thanks. Good morning. It's really good to hear about that the 20% growth in the electronics portfolio. Obviously you've had major product launches here. So it looks like you\u2019re seeing good traction. I wonder if you could help us understand what would be good long-term growth assumptions for that part of your business say, one or two years out, I mean the 20% number is probably not sustainable a year out or correct me if I\u2019m wrong. Patrick Shannon : So, it\u2019s interesting to ponder the future convergence here. I think you have to go back to the macro forecast of 6% to 8% globally, but let\u2019s not underestimate there is 1 billion locks in the world. And the transformation because of mobile credentials is going to happen over the next five to 10 years globally and the market opportunity for us is very good. So I think you\u2019re right in your assessment 20% year-over-year is not going to happen, but that we should be north of that 6% to 8% global is certainly realistic and complementary acquisitions like Milre, Systek and SimonsVoss I think enhances our position. This strategy on open protocols I think will also complement us over time. Jeremie Capron : Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And going back to acquisitions, congratulations on these deals, it\u2019s good to see you signing on these. Your main competitors made some interesting comment around the current M&A environment. Obviously they\u2019ve done a lot of deals over the years and it looks like they\u2019re getting worried about prices and so I wonder if you could give us your perspective on prices for asset sale there, you sound like you have a still very active pipeline here and probably going to pull the trigger on a few more. So your commentary here would be welcome. Dave Petratis : So I think the market, we too made some obvious observations, the price of businesses are high today, you have to judge that versus your strategy does it make sense, can I fold this in and make a go. Second, the market leaders have been extremely successful in the roll up of the industry in some cases they are landmarked. They have got positions that preclude them from making moves. That doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t and because our positions are different. There is still opportunity in all areas of the world for Allegion to grow through acquisition and organically the market leader has been on a path of 15 years you could where they run into some of these challenges. So we think it is a good space. I continue to expect this industry to consolidate and that is an opportunity for us. Jeremie Capron : Thanks very much. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Q - David MacGregor Yes good morning everyone. Dave, I wondered if you could just talk about progress this quarter with the like North American light commercial channel and just, you said you were able to gain share there, just what that maybe behind those share gains? Dave Petratis : So we've identified light commercial R&R in the channel as an opportunity early. I\u2019m pleased with our execution on that. I think there has been some analysis by firms on the phone our organic growth not only this quarter, but back over several quarters as lead our industry and the development in the light commercial R&R is fuelling that. I would say we are continuing on our earlier \u2013 we are in the early innings of that acquisition and I\u2019m pleased with the outcomes that it\u2019s adding to our growth. David MacGregor : Do you see any change in the willingness of dealers to stock your product? Dave Petratis : Maybe too early there. If you understand some of the drivers of our programs, I think we\u2019re making early gains, short lead times, in stock availability in our factories and that\u2019s part of what I call the advancement of that program. For us to be very successful, I want our inventory on the shelves of our committed wholesale partners and then I\u2019ll back that up with the superior lead time capability in customer service that we\u2019ve got. David MacGregor : Got it. And then second question is just on Europe and I am wondering if you could talk about progress in terms of building your staff of [indiscernible]? Dave Petratis : Still in its early infancy, there has been a lot of moving parts in progress made in Europe, but we\u2019ve made one or two incremental adds, but implementing the overall strategy to drive at the targeted segments we have got more work to do. David MacGregor : Are there targeted pricing initiatives planned for Europe in the second half? Dave Petratis : Our focus has really been the elimination of profitable business. Europe is going to be a difficult pricing environment. We\u2019ve got to use outstanding customer service. We have dramatically improved on-time delivery in Europe and it will help us. At the addition of SimonsVoss so that we can have a spec driven discussion I think will lead for us to see some price realization versus straight price increases. Patrick Shannon : Yes I would just add to Dave that I think the team is part of this transformation and the focus on the front end of the business also. The market segmentation and looking at what pricing we can get on a customer by customer basis has really helped and if you look at the results, I mean you are seeing some incremental pricing come through even in kind of a flat low inflation environment. David MacGregor : Great, great. Last question is just wondering if you could discuss the pace of investments in the second half versus the first half and how that will show up in your margins? Patrick Shannon : Yes, so I would anticipate again the comps get a little bit easier particularly in Q4, but the level of investment, Q3 would be similar to what you saw here in Q2 in terms of year-over-year and then Q4 there is a pretty big drop in terms of the increase in incremental expenditure relative to the prior year. David MacGregor : Great, thanks very much. Patrick Shannon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Kessler from Imperial Capital. Your line is now open. Jeff Kessler : Thank you. Just a follow up on small business related items, are you with the first half with your Engage Technology, now you have, there is technology out there obviously from your competitors that purports to either mimic, be better or at least parallel Engage, how do you, when you go to market because this is clearly is a, this is clearly is a first mover product for you, an important product for you, how do you differentiate this product from what else is out there and as obviously going to becoming out there from other competitors? Patrick Shannon : So, I think our greatest advantage is to be able to leverage and continued to drive that technology into our full portfolio, not only beyond Schlage cylindrical lock, center mortise, and the Von Duprin AX devices potentially the closures and the over access environment. I think that\u2019s going to be very difficult for a competitor to overcome. If that mechanical strength leverage with this communication protocol that I think really puts water in the mold. Jeff Kessler : Okay and so as essentially you\u2019re in the communication protocol and Engage is the major differentiating factor because it can interact with all of the other pieces of your puzzle. Patrick Shannon : Yes, and we've got work to do bringing the rest of that puzzle into the connected pipeline but we\u2019re going to make it happen over the next 36 months and it builds on the legendary strengths that we had Von Duprin, LCN, Schlage, CISA, I like our opportunity. Jeff Kessler : Okay and just a quick follow up on the spec com that you made. Your strength in the United States has certainly been your capability of spec writers and writing the code and being ahead of everybody else with your, I guess that we can call it the trust factor, the fact that you\u2019re not going to screw up. Is there anyway even though obviously things are very, very different in Europe for your to, if you want to say clone or bring over talent from the U.S. to Europe in either training or work or just making them into European spec writers. Dave Petratis : So absolutely, you go through a factory, things like standard work process and some systems are key to how we think so we think that's an opportunity. Second is we've made some pretty significant investments over the years and continue to invest in things like configurators. Common configuraters around the world will help us drive that capability and if one of the advantages we have, we've got a big successful operation here in North America. The more we can think like a global company and take advantages of our positions globally it will help us grow. Jeff Kessler : Hey, but right now you are saying it is still in infancy? Dave Petratis : From a continental perspective, yes. We've got our pockets of strength in Italy in the Middle East of all laces because of fancy driven specs that are moving in there, but we want to build on it. We see this as an opportunity. SimonsVoss will complement them. Jeff Kessler : All right, great. Thank you very much. Dave Petratis : All right thanks Jeff. All right, thanks everybody. We'd like everyone to participate. For participating in today's call, please contact Tom Martineau if you've got any further questions. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr. Tom Martineau, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, please begin. Tom Martineau - Allegion Plc : Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank for joining us for the third quarter 2015 Allegion earnings call. With me today is Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and the presentation, which we will refer to in today's call are available on our website at www.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website. Please go to slide number two. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Our release and today's commentary includes non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of restructuring, acquisition and divestiture expenses and charges in current-year results and restructuring and spin expenses from prior-year results. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business, when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior-year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details. Dave and Patrick will discuss our third quarter 2015 results, which will be followed by a Q&A session. For the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and then reenter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone given the time allotted. Please go to slide three, and I'll turn the call over to Dave. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Thanks, Tom. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter for Allegion with nice organic growth and operating margin expansion. There has been a tremendous amount of positive activity during this past quarter and we'll be covering in today's call. Revenues of $544 million grew 5.1% on an organic basis. Total revenue declined 0.4%, reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency. Of note, organic growth for the business has averaged more than 6% over the last 12 months. And our electronics portfolio continues to perform well in the quarter, improving more than 30% versus prior year. We have seen a continuous acceleration of the electronics growth rate, reflected of an ongoing electromechanical transformation and supportive of our increased investment in accelerating new electronics security products and solutions. The Americas segment grew 7% organically driven by continued strength in both the non-residential and residential business. In EMEIA, organic growth of 2% reflects a slight improvement in the region, although market recovery continues to be mixed across countries. Our one decline this quarter is in the Asia-Pacific region with negative organic growth of 10%. Patrick will provide more details on this later, but the decline is primarily driven by weakness in our system integration business in China. Adjusted operating income of $116.8 million increased 5.3% versus the prior year. We realized the operating margin expansion in all regions and improved overall margin by 120 basis points. We continue to show margin improvement, while absorbing incremental investments, investments predominantly in new products and channel initiatives creating a 90 basis points headwind in the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.92 increased 35% versus the prior year, driven primarily from improved operating performance, acquisition and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by incremental investments and foreign exchange impact. This is our fifth straight quarter with double-digit earnings per share growth. We are raising our full-year 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $2.85 to $2.90 per share. Please go to slide four. We have been extremely active as a company affecting change aligned with our long-term growth strategies. I'm happy to report that we successfully closed the three acquisitions mentioned last quarter within the expected timeframe. We are well underway with the integration work and have already seen contribution in our third quarter results. We are excited to realize the benefit of our broader electronic portfolio as well as seeing the expansion of our position as a global leader in portable security. During the quarter, we completed the divestiture of our Venezuela business. This decision was made to reduce risk associated with an uncertain economic operating environment. Also in the quarter, we announced our intent to sell the majority stake in our Bocom Wincent business in China. Although a market leader in the system integration industry in China, this business was not deemed to be a good strategic fit with the rest of the Allegion portfolio. The sale has the benefit of reducing risks in an environment that is currently realizing an economic slowing, combined with tightening credit, and reduces the high capital requirements of the business. This decision allows us to prioritize efforts and resources on core mechanical and electronic hardware solutions. And earlier this month, we reached an agreement with regard to the restructuring plan for our CISA business in Italy that will ensure a long-term viability, enhance the customer experience. CISA remains a critical part of the European portfolio and will continue to provide innovative solutions for convergence of mechanical and electronic technologies. In conjunction with the plan, we will begin to transition products of \u2013 non-specialized product to Flex, an existing supplier of Allegion today. Flex offers innovative design, engineering, manufacturing, real-time supply chain insight and logistical services to companies of all sizes in various industries around today's connected world. By partnering with Flex, we will simplify and optimize our supply chain, reducing risks associated with the transition and will better serve our customer needs. And last we enhanced our debt structure with the issuance of 300 million in senior notes as well as completing an amendment and extension of our senior credit facility. The proceeds of the senior notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility as a result of the previous completed acquisitions. Please go to slide five. On September 1, we launched pre-orders for Schlage's newest Internet of Things innovation, the Schlage Sense Smart Deadbolt at Amazon.com, HomeDepot.com, and Build.com. Schlage Sense is one of the strongest most-intelligent Bluetooth-enabled locks on the market with the highest industry ratings for security and durability. It's designed to work with Apple HomeKit, allowing users to control their door lock as part of their Smart Home. Apple HomeKit technology provides advanced security with end-to-end encryption and authentication between the Schlage Sense Smart Deadbolt and an iPhone an iPad or an iPod Touch. With an Apple TV in the home, users can enjoy the convenience of remote access. Additionally, HomeKit lets consumers talk to unlock their Schlage Sense using Siri voice control. In November, Schlage Sense will be available in Apple Stores and online. This lock has received media attention from large industry ancillars (9:25) like CNET, and Hardware and Building Supply Dealer, along with praise from tech industry publications like Mashable, TechCrunch and Mac Rumors. I'm also proud to say it's been featured by large national media outlets like Fortune and CNBC. Schlage Sense will be \u2013 officially be available in retail in November in selected big-box stores like Home Depot and Lowe's. Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I'll be back to update you on our full year 2015 guidance. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. Please go to slide number six. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth in the third quarter as well as our growth by regional segment. As indicated, we delivered 5.1% organic growth in the third quarter, supported by incremental volume that reflects improving market fundamentals, price improvements and early traction on our key organic growth investments in products and channels. We realized solid organic growth in Americas and EMEIA segments. As expected, unfavorable foreign currency rates continue to be a headwind to revenue growth noted by the negative 7.5% decline. Our reporting segments were impacted by currency due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against currencies in EMEIA and Asia-Pacific as well as the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. Acquisitions and divestitures provided 2% of growth, which includes contributions from acquisitions offset by Venezuelan divestiture. Please go to slide number seven. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $544.5 million. This reflects a decrease of 0.4% versus the prior year, up 5.1% on an organic basis. We realized strong organic growth in Americas and EMEIA across most product segments. We continue to experience great progress in electronic product growth, up over 30% compared to the prior year period. This growth was across both residential and commercial segments and is the result of new products and accelerated adoption of electronic products. Adjusted operating income of $116.8 million grew 5.3% compared to the prior year. Incremental volume leverage and acquisitions compensated for increased investment spending and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. Adjusted operating margin of 21.5% reflects an increase of 120 basis points versus the prior year. Incremental investments made in the areas of new product development, channel and market expansion and certain infrastructure programs had a negative impact of 90 basis points on the quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.7% is a record performance since the company went public in December 2013. Please go to slide number eight. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2014, reported EPS was $0.65. Adjusting for prior year one-time separation and restructuring expenses of $0.03, the 2014 adjusted EPS was $0.68. Operational results increased EPS by $0.12, as pricing, production and favorable operating leverage were more than offset inflation and unfavorable currency exchange impacts. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate drove $0.15 per share improvement versus the prior year. The improvement reflects favorable changes in the mix of income earned in lower-rate jurisdictions and the benefit of discrete tax items recorded in the quarter. Acquisitions and interest expense added $0.02 as did other net items. Next, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategy specific to taxes and IT investments were a $0.03 reduction. And lastly, the net year-over-year impact of Venezuela at current exchange rates is a $0.04 reduction. This results in adjusted third quarter 2015 EPS of $0.92 per share. Continuing on, we have a negative $1.20 per share reduction for charges related to the Bocom Wincent, Venezuelan business divestitures as well as acquisition and restructuring expenses. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at the third quarter 2015 reported EPS of negative $0.28. Please go to slide number nine. Third quarter revenues for the Americas region were $418.9 million, down 1% or an increase of 7% on an organic basis. Higher volumes, pricing and contribution from the acquisition of Zero compensated for unfavorable currency movements in Canada, in Venezuela and the divestiture of a Venezuelan business. The higher volumes reflect strong organic growth in both residential and non-residential products. This reflects better-than-market performance driven by our new product and channel initiatives. Americas adjusted operating income of $122.2 million was down 1% versus the prior-year period. Pricing and productivity more than offset inflation and investment, while incremental volume was absorbed by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and the Venezuelan divestiture. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 10 basis points, while absorbing incremental investment spending that created a 70 basis point headwind in the quarter and unfavorable mix due to the Venezuelan divestiture. Please go to slide number 10. Third quarter revenues for EMEIA region were $91.5 million, up 2.2% both on a reported and on an organic basis. The growth was driven by strong pricing within the mechanical business and modest volume increases. Significant ongoing currency headwinds were offset by recent acquisitions completed in the quarter. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $5.9 million was up $4.7 million or 392% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 510 basis points, reflecting continued improvements in an ongoing business transformation as well as partial-quarter contributions from the recent acquisitions, which were accretive to the region's margins. Please go to slide number 11. Third quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $34.1 million, flat to the prior year. Revenues were down 10.2% on an organic basis. Strength in the hardware business and acquisitions offset unfavorable foreign exchange and a decline in the Bocom Wincent system integration business. The decline reflects the slowdown of the China business environment and the delay of a few large projects. Note that this business historically relies on large project awards in the second half of the year. During the third quarter, projects in the pipeline have been delayed, resulting in a year-over-year reduction in revenue of approximately $6 million or negative 36%. We also expect an impact to the fourth quarter organic growth rates, which Dave will discuss later. Of note, the announced divestiture of Bocom Wincent reduces future risk inherent in the seasonal nature of the business both in terms of size and timing of awards. Asia-pacific adjusted operating income of $0.7 million was up $1.2 million or 240% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 360 basis points due to the mix shift of hardware volume, productivity and acquisitions, which offset inflation and currency exchange impacts. Please go to slide number 12. Year-to-date available cash flow for 2015 was $98.7 million, a reduction of $36.3 million compared to the prior-year period. The reduction in year-over-year cash flow was due to increased operating cash requirements and one-time cash tax payments, partially offset by reduced capital expenditures. We continue to operate with an effective working capital structure and continue to see improvement in working capital as a percentage of revenue as well as our cash conversion cycle. We expect full-year available cash flow for the business to be approximately $200 million. This guidance incorporates a reduction in anticipated 2015 collections for our Bocom Wincent business and slightly higher working capital requirements. I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full-year 2015 guidance. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Thank you, Patrick. Please go to slide 13. Looking at full-year revenue guidance, we are increasing our growth expectations for the full year by 1 point. In the Americas, we are improving organic revenue growth by 50 basis points, reflecting the third quarter results. Reported full-year revenue growth for the Americas remains consistent to prior guidance as the increases in organic revenue is offset by increased currency headwinds. We see the end markets as unchanged from prior guidance with regard to verticals or construction growth. Total revenue for EMEIA region now reflects the inclusion of the SimonsVoss and AXA acquisitions, while growth guidance remained unchanged. The largest change occurs within our Asia-Pacific region, where we now forecast organic revenues to decline for the full year by negative 13% to 15%. This impact flows through the total Asia-Pacific revenues that are primarily offset by the inclusion of the Milre acquisition. As Patrick mentioned earlier, when discussing Q3 results, the revenue call down is related to the Bocom Wincent system integration business where we now forecast a number of large projects to be delayed until 2016. And note that we would continue to include Bocom Wincent in our guidance as announced, but not yet closed transaction. Furthermore, margins for Bocom Wincent are historically strongest in the fourth quarter due to increased volume, which compensates for operating losses in the first three quarters. Given the reduction in volume, we expect full-year margins for Asia-Pacific to be down from prior year and close to breakeven. We estimate the earnings impact of the lower Bocom Wincent revenues in the fourth quarter to be a headwind of approximately $0.05 versus prior guidance. Inclusive of this impact, we are still able to increase full-year adjusted EPS from continuing operations to a range a $2.85 to $2.90. This reflects an improvement of our adjusted effective tax rate now estimated to be 20% for the full year, an improved operational performance. Furthermore, this incorporates the impact of acquisitions as well as increased interest expense related to the new senior notes. Please go to slide 14. The third quarter results were very strong and represented solid growth with a 5.1% organic revenue increase, a 120 basis point margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share growth of over 35%. From a market perspective, the trends for the U.S. market are still leaning positive, although economic data remains choppy. And after a long recessionary cycle, we are seeing signs of slight improvements in our primary European geographies. In Asia-Pacific, China growth is decelerating, while other countries outside China are holding. Overall, the business continues to perform well, and we are executing at a high level. We're making the top portfolio decisions that need to be made and we'll continue to execute on our strategies to drive profitable growth and customer satisfaction. Now, Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Good morning, Rich. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I wanted to just, Dave, ask you about institutional markets. I know it didn't seem like you changed your outlook at least in the Americas around verticals. And the institutional activity seems to be getting better here as the years progress, which provides some visibility into 2016. So, just want to get a quick update on your initial thoughts as we move forward over the next six months to 12 months on institutional. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : As we see the institutional markets, they continue to lean positive. But we don't see a huge sea change in the environment that we've operated in previously. I recently was at our California field office and was extremely pleased with the bond approvals for Southern California schools. So, it tends to support our view and I think your view that institutional spending, state government spending is improving. But we're still nowhere near normal. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. But net-net, would you say that that should be an incremental positive as you look at \u2013 start to think about 2016 versus this year? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I think it's a mixed bag. It's positive, as I saw in California, you move into some of the oil patches, like Texas, which has been a good driver, softer. So, I think you've got to take into context, we continue to be leaning positive, but we still think we've got a couple of years for the institutional state budgets to normalize. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then just last on Europe. So, the margin outperformed versus expectation here in Q3. You've got the 10% target for next year. How would you gauge progress versus your goal in Europe at this point? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : 10% target doesn't change. We lost a couple months in the labor negotiations, which we closed. And overall, very pleased with the trajectory of the base business and believe SimonsVoss and AXA pushes us well into our goal aspirations. But our goal remains the same. On the base business, 10% OI and we're headed towards that achievement. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. I'll pass it on. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeremie Capron with CLSA. Your line is now open. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Dave, I think you called out some progress in terms of the channel in the U.S., the repair and replace market. Could you dig a little deeper into this and give us more color around the progress there and where you're starting from and if the timeline has changed at all? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So, we reviewed our channel initiatives and growth in the retrofit and tenant improvement build-out in the quarter. The results are exceeding our expectations, but I want to ground you, we launched that program in six cities. I've said clearly, our target is to launch that across the United States and Canada, let's say 32 cities, and we'll do that over 36 months. But we're pleased with the progress and it's embedded in our organic growth. And we see further progress as we move into 2016 and 2017. I think why wouldn't I go faster? This program's got to be done correctly and it takes people. And so, pleased with the results and we'll continue to work on these areas. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : That's good to hear. And moving to the electronic portfolio, so I think you said more than 30% growth in electronic last year. I mean, between the new Sense, you've got the Connect series, and now you've got SimonsVoss that's added to the portfolio, it looks like you have a pretty full range now of electromechanical locks. Can you... (28:03 \u2013 35:06) David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : We are mindful of that. Whatever the economy deals us, I think you can look for us to execution, but we erred on the side of caution. Unknown Speaker : I mean is, how things are tracking so far in the quarter warrant keeping that low end of the range where it is? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : We would say yes. Unknown Speaker : Got you. And then maybe just a quick on pricing. I mean, pricing has been accelerating for the last few quarters. Just curious about what's driving that. I assume some of the new products, but also the outlook for pricing. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : We raised prices end of Q3. We saw some effects of that in the quarter. I would say the pricing environment continues to be slightly positive. I think in the Americas, we got a little less than 1%. And we continue to see that moving forward as opportunistic, how can we sharpen our gain in terms of achieving price realization on the commercial as well as the residential side. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah. Just a little bit more color too, Rob (36:21). The majority of that price increase or what you're seeing in the numbers year-over-year is on the commercial side. Residential has kind of been a challenge throughout the course of the year. Anytime we introduce new products, that's not reflected in a price change, i.e., it's just the delta shows up in organic growth or new products. Unknown Speaker : Got you. Did the change in price cause any pull forward into the quarter? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : No, not really. We think it's a pretty good comparison and didn't really pull forward any activity. Unknown Speaker : Got you. Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Hey, Josh. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Just because I got disconnected here, you can cut me off if you already went through it, but I think as a follow-up to Rich's question earlier on European margins. If we had to take that 10% and true it up just for the new business, from a mix perspective, that you guys have acquired, maybe not pretending any margin improvements there, but kind of fully loaded what would that look like now on a more apples-to-apples basis? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yes. So, we'll be giving full year 2016 guidance at the next quarterly conference call. The acquisitions are accretive to the overall margins. So, you would expect to see, as you look at the European region next year, to be north of 10%, certainly. As Dave highlighted, the business has really made good progress relative to the margin expansion. On the base business, we continue to get the carryover effects relative to the restructuring programs we executed last year. Team has done a great job on pricing. We talked about really looking at customer-specific accounts and trying to be more specific there in terms of implementing and executing price increases. This move, in terms of the facility, helps bridge the gap from base business performance to get us closer to that 10% margin on base business. So, a lot of good progress there. When we go out with guidance on a going-forward basis, we'll probably be talking about how the overall European region is performing and provide guidance relative to that aspect. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got you. That's helpful. And if I could just ask a corollary to that, on all the puts and takes in 2015 guidance, can you maybe parse out, aside from Bocom, what the acquisitions and other divestiture, i.e. Venezuela, are contributing to that? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : For what period, specifically? Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: For 2015, so I guess for the fourth quarter, for the changes you guys just made, how much of that is the other deals that have closed? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : So, you saw in the quarter, again, net of the incremental interest associated with the acquisitions, i.e., the new senior notes, about a $0.02 contribution, net. I would anticipate to see something similar in Q4 relative to the acquisition performance. And going forward, you would expect that perhaps to get a little bit stronger as we begin to realize the integration efforts, synergy attainment and those type of things. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. But no real step function into the fourth quarter necessarily? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : No. No. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got you. All right. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Winoker with Bernstein. Your line is now open. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks and good morning, guys. Also, line cut out on me as well as the number of investors, so if ask something that's already been asked, just let me know. On the organic growth side for the fourth quarter, just want to make sure I understand this. Bocom, et cetera, is being included in that kind of sounds like negative organic growth in total for the entire quarter. Is that correct? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : That's correct. And that business, in particular, Q4, I mean, last year had a very strong quarter. There was a couple of large project wins in the quarter. And so, if you look at it year-over-year, it's about a $30 million call down in the quarter. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. So, that explains that. And then, on the capital allocation side, where are you thinking now in terms incremental leverage given where you're running and what you're seeing in the U.S. and Europe being a little bit stronger? How are you thinking about continued acquisition runway in size, tuck-in versus maybe a larger transformational versus share buybacks at this point? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : We continue to be aggressive on working the acquisition pipeline. Deal size tend to be reflective of what you saw in AXA, SimonsVoss or smaller, you know, is what our game is. We think there is plenty of runway there. Patrick, some additional comments? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah. So, you guys are aware. I mean, we target a leverage ratio from 3.25 to 2.75. We're a little bit north of that today. Not concerning because of the free cash flow generation of this business. We delever fairly quickly and we'll do so next year. So, I think next year's plan would kind of put us back in the middle of that range. And we've indicated previously that would not have an issue with going to, say, 4 times leverage for the right transactions. And we also have our equity currency that we could use for the right type of strategic deal. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And if I could just sneak one more in on tax rate, if you didn't answer this. So, ex those one-time items, where are you? Does that change your kind of expectations in terms of where you're trying to head? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : For this year, no. So, the majority of the rate improvement for Q3 was one-time favorable discrete items. We've got a full year effective rate of 20%, which puts Q4 around 22%, which was our beginning-of-the-year guidance. We are still marching towards the 20% target for 2016, making some good progress there, a little headwind relative to the acquisitions just given the nature where the earnings are. But I think we'll be able to execute some tax planning strategies that mitigate that and get us within the target that we established last year for 20% in 2016. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is now open. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. And I'd been disconnected as well. So, if you've addressed this already, I apologize. But Dave, you talked about the 90 basis points of... David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : David, can you speak closer to the phone? You're just fading on us. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. I'm sorry. A lot of phone troubles here this morning. I apologize. You talked about the 90 basis points \u2013 can you hear me now? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Yes. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yeah. The 90 basis points of headwinds associated with the investments. I think earlier in the year, you'd been up closer to about 150 basis points. So, it seems like maybe that's coming off. Maybe now with Sense roll out, that continues to come off, I'm not sure. Maybe you could talk about that and just what do you expect that number to look like for the fourth quarter, but I guess more importantly for 2016? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah. So, we had or beginning-of-year guidance had guided incremental investments around $0.15 to $0.20 per share impact year-to-date. We're around $0.15. Q4, you're going to see a tapering off. Maybe there is $0.02 to $0.03 impact. And the year-over-year impact relative to the margin comes down, maybe to around 40 basis points or 50 basis points. You may recall last year, Q4 in particular, really stepped up our activities associated with engineering and those repair retrofit market opportunity that Dave talked about, making incremental investments in the channel, et cetera. So, it does start coming down. You kind of look forward to 2016, and you would expect the incremental year-over-year investments to also decrease on a full year basis as we previously highlighted at our shareholder meeting in March. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. In the residential, I wonder if you could just talk about, within kind of the conventional product offering, what competitive conditions within the big-box aisle look like right now and the extent to which this is impacting your residential margins. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So, from a competitive standpoint, in big box, our results are strong. We think the overall demand, especially for renovation and retrofit, is positive. New home starts again will be choppy, but we think they normalize around 1.4 million to 1.6 million; we like that. We think the new products; Schlage Touch, Schlage Sense, Schlage Pulse, actually expands the total available market for our products. So, I'm net positive and I think we're executing well. I challenge all of you, understand the new Schlage Sense. It's a superior product out there and I think we'll perform well in that environment versus the competition. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Last question. Just within your portfolio of North American businesses and the various lines and the markets you've got there, do you watch one or two or three as particular leading indicators? And what would you be seeing there right now? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So, ironically, our door business, Steelcraft, is an early indicator, because in the new construction, it's like cement and starts, so it gives you an indication of what's ahead. And I'd say, generally, that business continues to lean positively. I think all of this construction, whether it's residential, commercial, is capped by labor availability, land availability. And if I looked at just frame, doorframes, that market continues to be positive. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Thanks very much and congratulations on all the progress. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs from Baird. Your line is now open. Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. Good morning. Nice job. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Hey, Tim. Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I guess just the first question I wanted to ask. If you look at the midpoint of your prior guidance and the midpoint of this guidance, there's some moving pieces and I was just hoping you could tell us or maybe break it into a few buckets in terms of how much is the core guidance up? How much is acquisitions? How much is the tax rate? And then maybe, what the headwinds are from Bocom and then maybe some of the Venezuela stuff? It sounds like there might be a little bit of incremental there from the divestiture. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah. So, if you kind of start with the beat relative to Q3 performance, tax, $0.07 to $0.08; ops, $0.05 or so, and you had other of a penny. The way you should probably think about Q4 is \u2013 or the full year is that that carries forward and then you've got a negative reduction on Bocom, which we mentioned a $0.05, and that's offset by acquisitions net of interest of a couple pennies and then the general business or operations $0.03 is how I would kind of characterize it, if you got midpoint to midpoint. Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then, if we just completely ripped out Bocom, what would be the adjusted impact in the full year of 2014? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : So... Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Is that (49:15) $0.06? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : That's $0.06 per share, year-over-year... Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And then be higher in the fourth quarter. I'm not sure I understand because $0.05 is coming up for Bocom, but effectively that will be divested by the next time you guys report. So, I'm just trying understand what the total impact on EPS could be from Bocom. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah. So, year-over-year $0.05. That assumes some profitability in the quarter. Okay. Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : We've got it in for the full quarter. If the divestiture takes place, let's say, December 1, for example, it would have some added pressure on earnings, because a lot of the revenue generation is in the month of December, it's just the way the contracts work with the government. But we'll see and we'll talk about that when we get there. Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Okay. And then, the other question I had was just \u2013 it's a broader question. But Dave, could you talk a little bit about just the Safe Schools initiatives. I don't know. You've talked about it a little bit in the past, but just curious where we are maybe with those initiatives and what's the opportunity for Allegion over the next few years from just Safe Schools? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I think Safe Schools is predominantly driven by funding. There is movement. The State of California has passed legislation that requires locks with visible signaling capability that you can visually see that is secure for rooms with over five people. But there's still a long way to go on this. We've created a list for consortium and awareness on this. But we're still on the front-end of this initiative. And I think we're providing some good thought leadership in terms of how do we keep students safe, but how do we also create an environment that allows them to exit, if required. I mean, you've got concerns of fire safety as well as violence safety. This is all opportunistic, but it continues to be in its infancy in development and I think lacks funding. Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Well, nice job and good luck. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Mitchell (51:40) with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Sorry, it's Julian Mitchell. Just a question around the European business, trying to understand the margin impact from acquisitions. In Q4, the last couple of years you've had a very strong margin. What sort of margin rate should we expect for Europe right now this quarter exiting the year? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : So, normally, we don't provide quarterly guidance relative to regions, but given the accretion relative to the acquired businesses and some of the improvements that the business is executed on during the course of the year. North of last year, I mean, you're exactly right. Seasonally, it is the best quarter for that segment of our business. I think it was around 11% or so last year. So, you can expect the results for this quarter to be north of that in aggregate. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Understood. Thank you. And then, just my follow-up is on the Asia-Pacific. Maybe give us sense of the scale of that business and the profitability ex-Bocom and what the strategy there is from here? Is it sort of consolidating what you have left? Do you look to kind of re-grow with acquisitions off that lowered base? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So, think about Asia-Pacific in our mechanical core business $90 million to $100 million, slightly profitable on today's scale. We'll work to put improved profitability and growth into that region similar to what we've done in Europe. I think the thing to remember, Asia-Pacific, from a mechanical electronic standpoint, grew low-double digits in the quarter. So, with our FSH acquisition, the Milre acquisition, we think we're building a base there that can compete. And it's another strategic issue that will go to drive what's our long-term view there. But we think \u2013 we're positive on the region. We think China, India, the whole area will continue to be a growth opportunity for us and will position ourselves over the long term. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, guys. I was also off for a few minutes. So, I apologize if any of this is repetitive. But I just wanted to get a little bit more in the price costs. Patrick, can you give us some idea of how much of the realized price you saw was just kind of actions to counter FX versus kind of real like-for-like price? That's the first question. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah. So, the actions implemented to offset FX predominantly was in Europe, smaller part of our business, but they did see some good price pull through in the quarter. But from an overall perspective, relative to the total company, small impact on price, so the majority of the price improvement you saw coming through in Americas, very little FX related. And so, we would expect with a new price increase announced this quarter, hopefully, that trend to continue going forward. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : I'm sorry. I missed it. Did you say the size of that price increase? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Excuse me? Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Did you say the size of that price increase, earlier in the call? I missed that. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : No, we didn't. I mean, the list price is always announced at a higher level. And then when you settle after discounts and rebates, et cetera, it's lower. But normally, we look to try to get a 1% net price improvement year-over-year. That's the target. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And then... Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Sometimes, it's difficult to get particularly in the residential segment. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. And then you mentioned inflation in your opening remarks. I'm sure there is some meaningful cost deflation in parts of the equation. But net-net, the cost structure is experiencing inflation. Can you provide a little more color on that? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yes. So, the inflation comment really salaries, people-oriented-type costs. Materials year-to-date, I'd say, we're at a net positive when I look at how prices have reacted, particularly given the commodity cost today. I mean, you're looking at spot rates for brass, zinc, copper, et cetera, 20%-plus below last year's average rate. And we would expect to participate in that decline in cost. Keep in mind, our raw material purchases, not a large percentage of our overall material buy. And we do enter into supplier contracts as we've talked about previously. So, no immediate impact on our operating results, but certainly as we look forward to 2016 given where commodity rates are trading today, it should be a positive effect on our margins going forward. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. And just one quick one finally and I'll jump off. Just the deals you said are similar in Q2 then Q3, why would that be if you only had kind of a partial quarter impact in Q3? Is there some other purchase accounting or some other dynamic going through or seasonality in the businesses that you bought? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yes. So, it's predominantly the interest impact. So, operationally, much higher uplift on the results, but it's the full-quarter effect on the interest. And we're adding in all the interest costs associated with the $300 million senior notes issued at the end of September. So, you've got the full quarter effect of that offsetting the operational impact. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. Got it. Thank you. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tom Kim with HBK. Your line is now open. Thomas H. Kim - HBK Investments LP : I'm all set. Thank you. Operator : I'm showing no further questions on the phone lines at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Tom Martineau for closing remarks. Tom Martineau - Allegion Plc : Yeah. I'd just like to thank everybody for attending. Again, I apologize for the technical delay that we had earlier in the call, but appreciate everybody's patients as we went through it. As always, if you have any further questions, please reach out. And we thank you for attending. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Conor Sweeney - Longbow Research LLC Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Allegion Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there'll be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Martineau, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tom Martineau - Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, Emilie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome, and thank for joining us for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 Allegion earnings call. With me today is Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we will refer to in today's call, are available on our website at www.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website. Please go to slide number two. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Our release and today's commentary includes non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of restructuring, acquisition and divestiture expenses and charges in current-year results and restructuring and spin expenses and charges related to the devaluation of our previously held Venezuela business from the prior-year results. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior-year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details. Dave and Patrick will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results and provide 2016 guidance, which will be followed by a Q&A session. For the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and then re-enter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone, given the time allotted. Please go to slide three, and I'll turn the call over to Dave. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Allegion posted another strong quarter of operational results and closed out a very strong year. I'm proud of the company we have built over our first two years and believe we have one of the safest and most engaged work force in the industry that drive the high level of execution and performance. Now onto the fourth quarter. Revenues of $545.4 million grew 4.8% on an organic basis led by strength in the Americas and European regions. Total revenue declined 4.9%, reflecting the impacts of divestitures and foreign currency. Adjusted operating income of $103.5 million decreased 2.9% versus the prior year, which again reflects recent divestitures. We realized solid leverage on incremental volume which improved overall operating margin by 40 basis points. The ability to deliver improved margins while absorbing incremental investments continues to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our business. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.89 increased 17% versus the prior year, driven primarily from improved operating performance, acquisitions and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by divestitures, incremental investments and foreign exchange impact. This is our sixth straight quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth. Please go to slide four. As we did last year, I'd like to step back and review our performance scorecard. We exceeded revenue expectations on a reported and organic basis. Markets performed as expected, and we achieved a high-level of contribution from our new product introductions and channel-led initiatives. We delivered an effective tax rate below 22% and exceeded our adjusted EPS goals. Before taking into account the realization of lower effective tax rate, we exceeded the high end of our original guidance by $0.07. Our results demonstrate the benefit of a balanced investment in the business, which also fell within guidance range. And although available cash flow as a percentage of earnings exceeded original guidance, I would comment that cash flow is shown on a reported basis. In 2015, this was somewhat distorted due to the one-time divestiture charges. As discussed last quarter, we expect to do a little better in absolute cash flow for the year, but we realized a reduction in collections associated with the Bocom Wincent business in Asia-Pacific, which has now been divesting. Please go to slide five. If we look beyond the financial scorecard, our 2015 accomplishments demonstrate our continued focus on our five growth pillars : core market expansion; innovation; opportunistic acquisitions; enterprise excellence; and growth in the emerging markets. Allegion remains committed to health and safety as a company, which was evident by the improvement of our safety metrics that were already some of the best in the industry. We made the necessary decisions on divestitures and leveraged acquisitions to strengthen our portfolio. We've managed our debt structure efficiently and made incremental investments to drive performance. Our growth in new products has been strong with a vitality index that has doubled from the prior year. The business is executing at an extremely high level. The decisions and performance in 2015 have positioned us well for 2016. Please go to slide six. When reflecting on the opportunities for long-term revenue growth, it's important to acknowledge the role Allegion's well-rounded brand portfolio will play, especially in terms of electromechanical convergence. Our investments in new products will provide growth not just for 2016, but for sustained growth in the future. In the residential market, those solutions include innovative products from our 2015 acquisitions in Schlage's leading and trusted home automation products. In the fourth quarter, Schlage launched the next generation of electronic access solutions, including the Schlage Sense for residential homes designed to work with Apple HomeKit as well as our Schlage Control Smart Locks for multifamily use that streamlines operations for building managers while giving residents convenient smart cards and phone credentials. In the commercial market, our historic pioneer brands like Von Duprin, CISA and Interflex are raising the bar in terms of innovative solutions for Allegion customers, and our acquisitions are also contributing as reflected by the SimonsVoss SmartIntego system, which recently earned the well-renowned German Design Award. These products are just a sampling of our leading electro-mechanical solutions, which will continue to build out innovation in existing and new categories. Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I'll be back to update you on our 2016 guidance. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. Please go to slide number seven. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for both fourth quarter and full year. I'll focus on the Allegion results and cover the regions in their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 4.8% and 5.4% organic growth in the fourth quarter and full year respectively. The strong organic growth reflects improved markets, the introduction of new products and the company's channel initiatives. Pricing was essentially flat in the quarter as favorable pricing in the EMEIA and Asia-Pacific regions were offset by slight decline in the Americas, driven by unfavorable residential pricing. Specific to the quarter, the residential business absorbed higher returns versus the prior year within the retail segment as well as higher rebates reflecting increased annual volume thresholds achieved within the quarter. It is important to note that the residential volumes were up low double digits in the quarter. Pricing for the commercial segment continues to get good traction. We continue to face foreign currency headwinds related to the strong U.S. dollar. However, the currency headwind is decelerating as noted by the negative 3.2% decline in the quarter as compared to the full year decline of 6.8%. And acquisitions contributed over $45 million in revenues in the quarter, which were more than offset by the divestitures of our Venezuela and Bocom businesses. Please go to slide number eight. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $545.4 million. This reflects a decrease of 4.9% versus the prior year, up 4.8% on an organic basis. The reported revenue reflects the currency and divestiture headwinds discussed previously, which drove a 17.6% year-over-year decline. This was partially offset by acquisitions and strong organic growth in Americas, EMEIA and the Asia-Pacific mechanical and electronic hardware business. We continue to experience great progress in electronic product growth, up over 28% compared to the prior-year period. In addition, we continue to make significant progress with our new product introductions and channel initiatives as reflected in the vitality index improvement mentioned by Dave earlier. Adjusted operating income of $103.5 million declined 2.9% compared to the prior year. Good incremental volume leverage and continued progress in our EMEIA margin transformation are reflected in the adjusted operating margin that improved 40 basis points. These benefits also covered incremental investment headwind of 20 basis points. Excluding the divestiture of Venezuela and Bocom, year-over-year margins accelerated 120 basis points compared to the prior-year period. And the adjusted industry-leading EBITDA margin of 21.6% is a 110-basis-point improvement versus the prior year and 160 basis points excluding the divestitures. The business is executing at an extremely high level demonstrating both strong organic growth and margin improvement in all regions while continuing to make investments for future profitable growth. Please go to slide number nine. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2014, reported EPS was $0.37. Adjusting $0.39 for the prior-year separation and restructuring expenses and other items as noted, the 2014 adjusted EPS was $0.76. Operational results increased EPS by $0.12 as favorable operating leverage and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. The decrease in adjusted effective tax rate drove $0.08 per share improvement versus the prior year. The improvement reflects favorable changes in the mix of income earned in lower rate jurisdictions, the continued execution of the company's tax strategies and the benefit of discrete tax items recorded in the quarter. Acquisitions added $0.05 in the quarter while divestitures were a $0.09 reduction. As you may remember, our Q3 guidance already anticipated a $0.05 headwind for the slowdown of the Bocom business. The actual results reflect an additional headwind versus prior guidance of approximately $0.03 related to the divestiture occurring sooner than previously forecasted. Next, interest, currency and other income were a net $0.02 reduction. The higher interest expenses related to the issuance of $300 million of senior notes completed in the third quarter. Other income primarily reflects the sale of non-strategic marketable securities, partially offset by net currency losses. And lastly, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategy specific to taxes and IT investments were a $0.01 reduction. This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2015 EPS of $0.89 per share. Continuing on, we have a negative $0.15 per share reduction from acquisition and restructuring charges, partially offset by a favorable divestiture charge. After a giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at the fourth quarter 2015 reported EPS of $0.74. Please go to slide number 10. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $383.1 million, down 2% or an increase of 6.6% on an organic basis. Reported revenue year-over-year comparisons were unfavorably impacted by currency movements in Canada and Colombia and the divestiture of the Venezuelan business. Strong organic growth reflects strong market performance driven by our new product and channel initiatives. As noted on the chart, we experienced very strong residential performance, mid-single-digit growth in non-residential products and strength in electronics across the portfolio. Americas' adjusted operating income of $100.2 million was up slightly versus the prior-year period. Incremental volume leverage and productivity more than covered the Venezuelan divestiture, higher inflation, foreign currency and investments. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 60 basis points while absorbing incremental investment spending that created a 50-basis-point headwind in the quarter. Excluding the Venezuelan business from prior-year results, operating margins improved 140 basis points. The ability to drive growth, improve our market-leading margins and drive investments demonstrates excellent performance by the entire Americas team. Please go to slide number 11. Fourth quarter for the EMEIA region were $129.2 million, up 24.8% or up 3.1% on an organic basis. The reported revenue growth was driven by acquisitions and the organic growth partially offset by currency headwinds. Acquisitions accounted for $35 million of the revenue increase in the quarter. Both SimonsVoss and AXA performed well in the quarter and are delivering on the expected results. The organic growth reflects price and strength and hospitality, Interflex and general market improvements. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $17.6 million increased 51.7% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 240 basis points, reflecting continued improvements in the ongoing business transformation as well as contributions from the recent acquisitions, which were accretive to Allegion's margins. And although it isn't reflected on the slide, the full year adjusted operating margin for EMEIA was 7.9%. If you remember, the 2013 adjusted operating margin for this business was approximately 1%. This is a significant accomplishment, and we feel we are well-positioned for continued margin improvement in 2016. Please go to slide number 12. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $33.1 million, down 58% versus the prior year. As noted on the slide, the decrease was specific to the system integration business, which drove a $55 million reduction in revenues year-over-year. Excluding the system integration business, revenues grew approximately 43%. This reflects the contributions of acquisitions in the region as well as organic growth exceeding 12%. Organic growth was strong in Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia. Asia-Pacific adjusted operating income of $2.2 million was down $7.5 million, reflecting the divestiture. Operating margin excluding the integration business reflects a positive story with an increase of 400 basis points versus the prior year. The operating margin improvement reflects volume leverage, productivity and accretive acquisitions that more than offset inflation and currency headwinds. Please go to slide number 13. Available cash flow for 2015 was $222.2 million, an increase of $14.7 million compared to the prior year period. The increase in the year-over-year cash flow was primarily due to reduced capital expenditures. Specific to capital expenditures, we anticipate investing approximately $10 million more in 2016 than 2015 for new product development, operations and IT projects. As noted on the slide, we now reflect the impact of recent acquisitions and divestitures in the current numbers. Although this recalibrates the baseline somewhat, it doesn't change our commitment to an effective and efficient working capital structure to maintain minimum levels of investment. Please go to slide number 14. You'll remember our capital allocation strategy for our Investor Day that defined a balanced and flexible approach. This reflected our strategy on day one remains our focus and commitment for 2016. We ended the year with a gross debt to adjusted EBITDA of 3.5x, which reflects the impact of the recent debt offering and facilitated our acquisitions in 2015. Given EBITDA growth and debt amortization, we will be able to quickly delever to be within our targeted range of 2.75x to 3.25x. As Dave will mention later in the guidance, we continue to see opportunity to fund incremental investments in organic growth for new product development, channel strategies and enterprise excellence to accelerate core market expansion. Supported by our 2015 performance, we believe these investments will enable the company to grow at an accelerated pace and faster than the broader market with higher returns on invested capital. We remain focused on growing our portfolio through acquisitions. We have gained considerable experience, successfully integrating a number of acquisitions over the past year that have been accretive to our results and the M&A pipeline continues to remain active. And lastly, we have the opportunity to provide shareholder distributions through increased dividends that reflect strength and confidence in cash flow. And we will continue to repurchase shares offset dilution and to be opportunistic when appropriate. In summary, due to the consistent high cash flow generation, we have many options to deploy capital to yield higher returns for our shareholders. I'll now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2016 guidance. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Patrick. Please go to slide 15. We expect continued growth in our primary markets in 2016 but recognize that we are in a period of macroeconomic uncertainty and currency volatility. Our expectation is that the organic investments combined with our ability to execute will deliver better than market growth. In the Americas, our exposure to non-residential construction markets remain a positive. However, U.S. GDP levels are forecasted to remain below 3%, which I believe is a point that defines sustained growth. And if you were to review industry assessments for commercial markets today, you would find a wide variance in expectations. We remain positive yet cautious in this area. On the institutional markets, we continue to expect slow improvement, characterized by more balanced educational demand between K through 12 and higher education since Safe Schools Initiatives and the need for school security upgrade is evident when you review state legislative priorities. The outlook for healthcare remains more subdued in 2016 with flat to moderate increases. Overall, we anticipate low-to-mid-single-digit growth for the non-residential segment. The U.S. residential market will continue to increase mid single digits driven by both builder and big box segments. Single family home construction will continue its recovery, although we continue to expect variance in the segment driven by labor and land availability. The multifamily segment will continue to grow, but we expect a deceleration in the rate of growth as compared to the last two years. Consolidating the market outlooks, we project organic revenue growth in the Americas of 5% to 6% and reported revenue growth of 4% to 5% reflecting some currency pressure. For the European region, we anticipate low single-digit market growth overall. We expect continued growth in the German and UK markets and modest growth in Italy. We believe that recovery in France will continue to lag, and we expect further contraction in Eastern Europe. For the region, we project organic growth of 1% to 3%. When we combine the impact of acquisitions partially offset by currency, we project reported revenue growth of 25% to 27% for the year. The Asia-Pacific markets continue to show low-to-mid single digit growth in residential and non-residential segments. Our current portfolio reduces our risk to the slowing China economy and positions us well in Australia, New Zealand, and Korea. Organic growth in the region is estimated to be 5% to 7%, and total revenue is estimated to decline 16% to 18%, which reflects the system integration divestiture. All-in, we are projecting organic growth of 4% to 5%. Incorporating the net benefit of acquisitions that offset divestitures and currency headwinds, we expect total revenue to grow up to 7% to 8%. Please go to slide 16. Our 2016 adjusted earnings per share range is $3.25 to $3.40, an increase of 7% to 12%. The earnings increase is primarily driven by operational improvements and the net benefit of acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by investments in the business, currency headwinds, interest and a higher effective tax rate assumed to be between 18% and 19% for the year. We are forecasting strong organic growth and margin expansion in all of our reporting regions. Incremental investments, which are forecasted to be lower in 2015, will be focused on new products and channel development to meet demands of the electro-mechanical conversion as well as driving solutions for the underserved repair and replacement markets. Our guidance assumes outstanding diluted shares of approximately 97 million, which reflects the company's goal to at least offset share dilution with buybacks. Restructuring and acquisition expenses are expected to be in the range of negative $0.05 to $0.10, resulting in a reported EPS range of $3.15 to $3.35. Please go to slide 17. We are very pleased with our 2015 results that delivered organic revenue growth over 5% and increased our operating margin by 50 basis points. The growth of both revenue margin while making investments in our business demonstrates the disciplined approach we set out two years ago. We've made tremendous progress improving our European profitability from slightly positive two years ago to an 8% rate today. It's truly a great accomplishment by the entire team to achieve these results so quickly. And we delivered on our effective tax rate commitments, sustaining below 20%. We continue to generate strong cash flow and are recognizing growth from our organic investments. We look forward to 2016 as an opportunity to build on our prior results. Although we expect continued market volatility and currency headwinds, we remain focused on our growth strategies to guide us through the challenging markets. We have a safe and strong team in place, committed to our vision to make the world safer and secure the places where people thrive. Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. . Our first question is from Tim Wojs of Baird. Please go ahead. Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey. Good morning, guys. Nice job. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hey, Tim. Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I guess just on Americas. Two questions. If you look at the growth, end market growth. I think I get to about 3% to 4% from a volume perspective, and you're guiding to 5% to 6%. So could you just give us a little bit of color of what you're expecting? I think new products and probably price is what the bridge is there, but just some confirmation on that. And then just could you talk about the puts and takes to just EBIT margins in Americas in 2016? David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So I'll take the top line and pass it over to Patrick on some of the numbers. Our growth in Americas in 2016, we'll continue to leverage our electronic growth, which has been yielding nice returns. Second is we're moving into our second full year of channel development, and this is really going after the repair, replacement retrofit markets on the commercial side. And we presented that as really a five-year initiative, and we're gaining share with those initiatives and I think it should be reflected in the numbers. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, so, Tim, just to add from a revenue perspective in Americas, if you kind of look at the components in organic growth, we ended 2015 full year pricing of about 50-basis-points improvement; a little pressure from the residential segment, but getting pretty good traction on the commercial segment. I would expect this to show a little improvement there in 2016. From a volume perspective, again, really strong organic growth in 2015. There's a couple of quarters early in the year, easier comparisons, but volume is still anticipated to be fairly strong but down a little bit year-over-year. If you look at the margins for the full year, we showed a slight improvement, and I just remind you that was kind of weighted down a little bit because of the Venezuela divestiture. Extracting that, we had pretty good margin growth. We're on a path now; we've got pretty good visibility to productivity. We'll participate in a deflationary economy that we're seeing in commodities, and we'll continue to get good leverage on the incremental volumes. So I would anticipate the margin improvement to accelerate a little bit in 2016 basis of the incremental volume forecasted. Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And just on Venezuela, could you just remind us for the full year, what the impact to the margin was from both the FX and the divestiture? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes. I want to say in Americas specifically, for the full year, it was close to, let's see here, about 50 basis points impact. Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Okay. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Americas specifically. Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): All right. I'll hop back. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And just kind of thinking forward on that, because of the devaluation in 2015, that's going to have a minimal impact on the margin comparisons going forward for 2016 when you compare to 2015. Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Okay. Thanks. Well, good luck on 2016 guys. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please go ahead. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Steve. Peter Richard Lennox-King - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning guys. This is Peter Lennox-King on for Steve. Just \u2013 if we can talk about the EMEIA margins for a moment. Now that you've clearly breached to the 10% rate, at least for the quarter, and with the acquisitions and restructuring that you've been undergoing, what's the new run rate target that you've got there all-in? And then related to that, could you layout for us what the underlying or organic margin within EMEIA was, so leaving out there the recent acquisitions? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So a couple things, just as a reminder. Q4 historically from a seasonal perspective always operates at a much higher margin than the first three quarters of the year. So you're seeing a much higher than the 10% target that we had targeted in Q4. Having said that, if you kind of break out the components and you look at the base business, continued really excellent execution relative to our March toward the 10% target. I'd say we ended the year pretty much in line with our expectations. Moving some of the production out of our CISA facility this year will continue get us productivity benefits in 2016 and some carry forward in 2017 after that's completed. So we feel really good about the progress there. The acquisitions completed last year are accretive to the margins in the region. And so what you saw collectively, we ended pretty much for full year basis close to 8%, which is about 400 basis points improvement compared to full year 2014. You're looking at 2016 at a low kind of double-digit margin range. And I just remind you also that there is a big delta between EBIT and EBITDA margins in that region because of the acquisitions. EBITDA margins would be in the neighborhood of mid to high teens, which is a fairly significant and kind of in line with our peer group in the region. Peter Richard Lennox-King - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question is from Julian Mitchell, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Ronald Weiss - Creidt Suisse : Hey, guys, Ron Weiss in for Julian. I just... David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Ron. Ronald Weiss - Creidt Suisse : How you are doing? I just want to touch on the Asian-Pacific market. Now that the Bocom divestiture is complete, can we expect the margins there to kind of accelerate as we saw them accelerate in Q4 for all of 2016 or how should we think about the margin progression there for the year? David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I would look at that business going forward. You saw in the full year negative margins. A lot of that or all of that is due to the Bocom business. That of course is going to be peeled away going forward, and the acquisitions we've done in the region in the Pacific Rim have been very accretive to the regional results. And so you're looking at a business there, call it a little over $100 million mid single-digit. (35:12) margins is kind of the expectation going forward. And we'll continue to chip away in the margins through productivity and those type of things. But anticipate to see good progress, particularly year-over-year, in that region of the world for 2016. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I would add that Bocom was a distraction for us in the region. A focused Asia-Pacific team, building on the acquisitions that we've made there, has got a bright future and look for us to continue to drive improvement with that portfolio. Ronald Weiss - Creidt Suisse : Got it. And then just on the balance sheet, the goal is to bring the net debt-to-EBITDA down for the year. But if the right deal came along, where would you guys feel comfortable pushing that kind of leverage ratio up to for the year? David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So we highlighted the expectation without any large acquisitions because of the strong cash flow generation EBITDA growth and the mandatory principal reductions. We're going to delever fairly quickly. But we've always commented for the right transactions, again given the strong cash flow generation, wouldn't have a problem of going up to four times, maybe a little bit higher for the right transaction. And so I think we've got a lot of flexibility there, not only basis of the free cash flow generation, but the ability to add some incremental debt if we needed to. Ronald Weiss - Creidt Suisse : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question is from the Rich M. Kwas of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Rich. Ron J. Jewsikow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, this is Ron Jewsikow on for Rich Kwas. I was just wondering if you could provide a little more detail on the Safe Schools. You mentioned state priorities are reflecting the need for this. But are you seeing anything in budgeting specifically, or is it still kind of just more commentary? David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. I commented on this last quarter. I spent some time in Southern California and there's specific investments going in for schools. In particular, in rooms that have over five inhabitants, they've got to have visual locking capabilities, which is our CO-220, so that from across the room, you can determine whether it's secure or not. And I think the overall momentum in the market of state budgets, local budgets improve, their investments are going in. So we see activity, and I think it will continue to improve over the next 36 months. Ron J. Jewsikow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for that. And then just a quick kind of modeling question on the incremental investment headwinds. There was only $0.01 in the fourth quarter. How should we think about the cadence of that in 2016? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, I would look at it fairly evenly ratably throughout the course of the year. There is some flexibility, variability there. But specific to new products, which is more kind of engineering-related that kind of is people related cost and that would kind of be steady state. And then on the channel initiative, again as Dave indicated, getting really good traction on the repair of retrofit markets here in North America, and we're going to continue to ratchet that up to take advantage of that opportunity. So that might be a little bit more kind of backend loaded, but for modeling purposes, steady state. Ron J. Jewsikow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's very helpful, and thanks for taking my questions, guys. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi, good morning, guys. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hi, Josh. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Just a follow-up on the earlier question, and maybe I missed it. Did you guys point out what you think EMEIA margins should be running at for the entirety of 2016? Obviously there is seasonality there. But did you explicitly say that? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. We've commented that we anticipated around low double digits. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. I guess... Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : With the EBITDA margins in the mid-teens to high teens. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: I guess the way that shakes out then, looking at your guidance is even with all this extra investment, you guys are still delivering incremental margins well above 40%, probably closer to 50% in the Americas. Is that a fair to way think about it? And I guess, some of these investments seem like they were going to start tapering off into this year, maybe not flat, but certainly much lower year-over-year numbers. Is it that you guys are finding more opportunity? Is it that maybe markets aren't recovering as quickly, slower rollout of new products? Just help us to mention maybe when these investments start to plateau. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So you've got two questions there. On the investments, as we highlighted in the Investor Day last year in March, we did highlight we'd expect it to start tapering down a little bit. You're correct in that. We continue to analyze that through our annual operating plans, and we believe that from a capital allocation perspective, to the extent we can drive good organic growth that have really strong returns on invested capital, we're going to make those bets. And because of the traction we've seen relative to electronic products growth and the channel initiative here in North America, we're accelerating some of those things and that's why it's down year-over-year, but maybe not as down as what you'd anticipated. But I still think it's good return on capital. Relative to your incremental margin question, I think it's a pretty good way that you're looking at it; 50% is high. We've always kind of stated this 40% type of target, and we really delivered on that in 2015. The extra benefit we're getting in this deflationary economy specific to commodities is we'll start seeing that come into our numbers a little bit more than what we saw in 2015, just given the spot rate trades relative to the average rates in 2015. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got you. That's helpful. And then I guess a follow-up on the electronic comments, you guys were finding more areas of opportunity. It seems like some of the feedback from the channel is that the NDE with ENGAGE rollout has been perhaps a little slow or not really showing up yet. Are you guys still piloting some of that in the market? Is that maybe some lessons learned early on? Just with that product specifically, how would you gauge the rollout and the cadence from here? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : When I think about the NDE, it's not met our expectations in term of the rollout, and I would argue that we underinvested. I think the lessons learned here is we should have had a full complement of Mortise communication gateways ready to go with that product, and we're going to continue. But that's the lesson learned. That was rolling when we created the company, and I wish we would have invested more because the product has clearly got its capabilities. It will step up in growth in 2016. But that frontier of electronic locks in the commercial arena is really the mother lode of opportunity for the company. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Would you say you have what you need today, or at what point do you reach that just based on the development pipeline? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : We'll make more expansion to that portfolio in 2016 and into 2017. Key is the Mortise offering. And the other thing is our channel, the locksmiths, the installers, not as fast to adopt as you see in the residential. So those are things that we're working on. We've got specific resources, focused resource after it and it's going to bear fruit. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: All right. Thanks a lot guys. I'll turn it over. Operator : Our next question is from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Conor Sweeney - Longbow Research LLC : Hey, good morning, guys. This is Conor Sweeney on for David this morning. Congrats on another great quarter. I just want to go back to the Americas, and in particular, 4Q organic growth of 6.6% and the full year growth of 7.1%. Could you talk about how that compares to the industry growth for the periods? And then also can you maintain this level of growth going forward in the Americas, or do you think you'll need to maybe lean more on Europe for growth going forward? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So I would observe if you line up some competitive landscape, we were certainly head to head with them, the world leader Assa, and outperformed the rest of the pack. Our growth initiatives, new products, channel development, we believe will continue to bear fruit and are going to continue to look to the Americas to lead that growth. As I reflect over to Europe, we see recovery in Europe, but the Northern European markets continue to perform better and we improved our position in 2015 with the acquisitions AXA, SimonsVoss. So more work to be done there. Some pretty fundamental things going on in Europe that'll help us in the future. Number one, we're profitable. Number two, developing better capabilities around specific segments of the business matched with specification capabilities. It'll help us, but it's all not going to come in a year. It's continuing on the plan that we have with investments and people and products and acquisitions that will get us where we want to be long term in Europe. Conor Sweeney - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. And then also as an add-on, can you talk about maybe in the residential space, the competitive conditions you're seeing in the big box aisle and to the extent that's impacting your residential margins here? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : It's no surprise among all the big box, they see the deflation of commodities and they're going after it, so the competitive's there. There's still a lot of opening price point on the new construction side. Again, we have pushed style and design and electronics, and that's helping us to expand margins. We tend to perform stronger on the replacement side of the house in residential construction, and we think that will continue to be good for us, especially with Schlage's sense like touch. Those would be my thoughts. Conor Sweeney - Longbow Research LLC : Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question is from Robert Barry of Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey, guys. Good morning. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hey, Robert. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : So just a bucket in the guide for operational improvements is pretty big bucket. I was wondering if you could maybe parse out a little more of what's happening in there in particular around the assumptions for price and price cost. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So what I mentioned earlier, pretty good leverage on the incremental volume would be reflected there. Pricing, call it, and it varies by region, but in aggregate, 50 basis points to 75 basis points improvement and that would be reflective in our organic growth assumptions. We've got some improvement baked in relative to the deflationary situation on commodities. I mean, those would be the three primary drivers of why you're seeing high leverage on the incremental volume. And then of course, the continuous improvement in the European margins is also helping that as well. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : I mean, is that deflationary piece relative to price kind of a significant component? Because I think just looking at the headlines on the commodities, there's been pretty substantial declines. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So I don't know how you define significant. It's certainly much higher than what we realized in 2015. Keep in mind, we talked about this I think on the last call. But our commodity spend relative to our total purchases, call it around 10%. So it's not a big portion for us. And secondly, we kind of have a supplier lock agreements that are kind of hedged over a period of 12 months. So we don't see the immediate benefit. When spot rates go down significantly, we don't see that effect immediately into our result. It kind of bleeds in over a period of 12 months, and so we've got a program there and we stick to the program. So we don't bet on the markets. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I would also say with 10% pure commodity, steel breadth that type have been, we've got to go and work with suppliers to wring out that value. Again, if something that we have maybe didn't stress, but when we spun out two years ago, we didn't spin out with a rich procurement capability. We've built it, and it's going to give us some opportunities in this deflationary environment. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got you. Maybe just shifting to Asia for a second. Could you just kind of level set us what the core growth was for the year on the businesses that are remaining in the portfolio? David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Probably, let's see here, I think it's around 10%. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I would say 12%. I think our core hardware business grew 12%. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : So kind of similar to what you saw in the fourth quarter? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : And that you see... Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I will check it and get back with you, but I believe that's correct. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got you. And so the slowdown, the five-year to seven-year forecasting, is that something mostly China? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : China clearly is slowing but it's a $100 million business, especially in China, our opportunities are really to get our products out there and focus. We like the acquisitions, Brio, Milre. These are new offerings that help us to grow in these regions. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. China, keep in mind, small business, niche market that we compete in. There's plenty of opportunity, I think, to take share from other folks. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got you. And maybe just finally on the cash flow, it looks like you're looking for a $60 million to $80 million increase in the available cash flow. What are the big components there? I assume some is tax. What's happening with working capital? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Big components would be, we talked about CapEx being up roughly $10 million year-over-year. D&A (51:54) would be higher than that. Working capital would be up just given the growth in the business. We still expect to kind of maintain this 5% of revenue metric within that range, but working capital being a use of cash. The other thing to keep in mind, we've historically targeted 100% of earnings. If you run the math, you wouldn't be seeing that for 2016. The primary purpose or reason for that is because in 2015, we recorded some restructuring costs associated with the CISA manufacturing relocation, and those cash expenditures haven't yet happened. That will occur in 2016, and so that's putting a drag on that ratio. But even with that, it's still pretty good cash flow conversion and we'll put it to use in the best way possible. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got you. So those are all drags. I mean, the working capital going up, the CapEx going up. So the increase is really just kind of the core of the EBITDA. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Earnings. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yeah. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is a follow-up from Tim Wojs of Baird. Please go ahead. Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey guys, just following up on the last point on cash flow. There is no change to the historical 100% conversion, right? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No. No. Again, a little pressure on 2016, but we believe it's sustainable to maintain 100% for a lot of the factors we've talked about : CapEx being lower than DNA; cash tax being equal to or lower than the book provision; and offsetting kind of the working capital increase basis on the growth of the business. So I think we can kind of maintain that going forward. That's the target. Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then just two housekeeping. What's the FX headwind that's embedded in just total revenue this year, and then what's corporate expense look like? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So FX headwind to the basis of current rates today could be as high as 1% would kind of be the high point of that. Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Our exposures are predominantly related to euro and Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar. And corporate expenditures, we ended the year in line kind of with our original guidance, and you would expect that because of some investments in the IT infrastructure, ERP programs, that's going to be up. We'll call it $60 million for the year, in that type of neighborhood. Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Tom Martineau for any closing remarks. Tom Martineau - Director- Investor Relations : Yeah, we like to thank everybody for participating in today's call. Have a safe day, and please call or contact me for any further questions.",

MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Allegion Reports First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Martineau. Please go ahead. Tom Martineau - Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, Kaye. Good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for the first quarter 2016 Allegion earnings call. With me today is Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we will refer to in today's call, are available on our website at www.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website. Please go to slide number two. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligations to update these forward-looking statements. Our release and today's commentary includes non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of restructuring and acquisition expenses in current-year results and charges related to the devaluation of the previously held Venezuelan business from the prior-year results. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior-year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details. Dave and Patrick will discuss our first quarter 2016 results which will be followed by a Q&A session. For the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and then reenter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone given the time allotted. Please go to slide three, and I'll turn the call over to Dave. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Tom. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We posted a solid quarter of results delivering organic revenue growth and margin expansion across all geographies. Revenues of $502 million grew 9.5% reflecting organic growth of 3.6%, as well as the benefit of prior-year acquisitions. Europe and Asia Pacific revenues were in line with expectations from a market and performance level. I would like to note that the Americas organic growth of 3.4% was delivered despite the implementation of a new operating system at our Indianapolis operation facility. This is part of a natural evolution of an older legacy system that will allow Allegion to continue to deliver best-in-class products and solutions. I am very pleased with the progress thus far and the speed and flexibility demonstrated by our teams to make the continuous improvements necessary to quickly restore our industry-leading delivery cycles at the Indianapolis plant. We believe the non-residential markets continue to show stable growth as reflected in the strength of our orders and backlogs in the first quarter. Patrick will provide further details when discussing the America's financials. Adjusted operating income of $84.6 million increased 12.5% versus the prior year. Overall operating margin improved by 40 basis points with all regions delivering increases versus the prior-year period. We remain focused on our growth strategies and continue to balance ongoing investments with improved operating performance. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.61 increased more than 19% versus the prior-year period, primarily driven from improved operating performance and acquisitions. This is our seventh straight quarter with double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. Also in the quarter, the company repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares. This is consistent with our balanced capital allocation strategy and goal to offset dilution at a minimum. Please go to slide four. In the Americas, Allegion's distinctive position as both a non-residential and residential market leader gives our team the capabilities to leverage technology across both markets. Utilizing these unique capabilities, we've implemented a new multi-family strategy to drive profit and grow market share, as well as establish thought leadership as the key implementation of multi-family strategy. Allegion has created Schlage Control, the next-generation of electronic access for the world of multi-family. The open integration capabilities deliver the ability for property owners to manage both residential and common area doors on a single superior system and from anywhere using cloud or Web-based apps. Schlage Control eliminates dealing with traditional keys while providing residents convenient smart card and phone credentials. Our deadbolts launched in December 2015 and our interconnected locks are set to launch in May. A number of other multi-family growth opportunities are being pursued including accelerating OEM software platforms, leveraging relationships with market influencers and creating standard specification guidelines. With all these initiatives, Allegion has created a complete solution package to offer multi-family customers. We look forward to watching for more success in the multi-family segment throughout 2016 and beyond. Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our full year guidance. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. Please go to slide number five. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the first quarter. I'll focus on the Allegion results and then cover the regions in their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 3.6% organic growth in the first quarter with balanced contributions from all regions. Each region contributed to price realization and volume growth was supported by stable markets that performed as expected. Foreign currency remains a headwind but is moderating sequentially when compared to prior quarters. And acquisitions contributed approximately $46 million or 10% growth, which more than offset the impact of divestitures. Please go to slide number six. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $502.3 million, which is a 9.5% increase versus the prior-year period. I was pleased with the revenue growth given solid price realization, the benefit of acquisitions, and organic contributions from each region. We continue to experience solid electronic product growth and are realizing the benefits of our new product introductions and channel initiatives. Adjusted operating income of $84.6 million increased 12.5% compared to the prior year. All regions delivered improved operating margins and this reflects the fourth straight quarter of year-over-year margin and growth. The benefit of acquisitions, favorable pricing, productivity and net commodity deflation more than offset other inflation and investments. Of note, volume increases were partially offset by unfavorable mix in the quarter most notably related to the mix of products sold in the Americas. I will discuss this in more detail when reviewing the Americas slide. I'd also note that we improved our industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin to 19.8%, an improvement of 100 basis points versus the prior year. All regions improved on this metric in the quarter. Please go to slide number seven. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter of 2015, reported EPS was $0.47. Adjusting $0.04 for the prior year, Venezuela devaluation and non-cash impairment charge, the 2015 adjusted EPS was $0.51. Operational results increased EPS by $0.07 as favorable price, foreign exchange and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. Although foreign exchange was a revenue headwind in the quarter, this was offset by our foreign-denominated costs resulting in a slight favorability to EPS when compared to the prior year. Acquisitions net of divestitures added $0.04 in the quarter. Next, interest and other income were a net $0.03 increase. The higher interest expense is related to the issuance of $300 million of senior notes completed in the third quarter 2015. Favorable other net items primarily reflects the sale of non-strategic marketable securities in a onetime benefit from equity investments. The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate drove a $0.01 per share decline versus the prior year. The first quarter effective tax rate is higher than the full year guidance, reflecting the timing of certain tax positions. Lastly, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives were a $0.03 reduction. This results in adjusted first quarter 2016 EPS of $0.61 per share, an increase of approximately 20% versus the prior-year period. Continuing on, we have a negative $0.01 per share reduction for acquisition and restructuring charges. After giving effect to these onetime items, we arrive at first quarter 2016 recorded EPS of $0.60. Please go to slide number eight. First quarter revenues for the Americas region were $363 million, up 2.5% or an increase of 3.4% on an organic basis. The residential business continues to perform well, delivering high-single-digit growth with strength across all channels. Our investments in electronic products and style and design solutions continue to deliver strong results. The non-residential segment delivered low-single-digit growth while implementing a new operating system at our Indianapolis facility. It's important to note that we realized high-single-digit non-residential order growth in the first quarter and associated increase in backlog primarily driven by the system transition. As such, we expect some quarterly timing impacts as we work through the backlog. We continue to believe that the market fundamentals for non-residential construction remain in place for low- to mid-single-digit growth for the year. Americas' adjusted operating income of $91.6 million was up 3.6% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 20 basis points. The margin improvement was driven by favorable price, material productivity and material deflation that fully offset unfavorable mix in the quarter. The unfavorable mix was due to the strength of residential growth as well as a mix of commercial product as impacted by the timing effect on shipments related to the operating system transition. Please go to slide number nine. First quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $118.5 million, up 45% or up 3.3% on an organic basis. The organic growth reflected solid price realization and good performance across most geographies. Acquisitions delivered more than $36 million in incremental revenue. Electronic product growth continues to be strong driven by hospitality and CISA products. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $8.3 million increased 219% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 380 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 550 basis points, reflecting continued improvements in the ongoing business transformation, as well as contributions from recent acquisitions which were accretive to the region's margins. Please go to slide number 10. First quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $20.8 million, down 8.4% versus the prior-year period. As noted on the slide, the decrease was specific to the divestiture of the system integration business, which drove a $9.9 million reduction in revenues year-over-year. Excluding the system integration business, revenues grew approximately 63%. This reflects the contributions of acquisitions in the region as well as organic growth exceeding 14%. Most sub-regions performed well with notable strength in our China hardware and Australia/New Zealand segments. Asia Pacific broke even on adjusted operating income basis, which reflects an improvement of $2.6 million versus the prior-year period. We continue to drive focus on mechanical and electronic hardware solutions, are leveraging the acquisitions made in 2015, and are making good progress in addressing stranded costs related to the system integration divestiture. Please go to slide number 11. Available cash flow for first quarter 2016 was negative $8.2 million, slightly below prior year. The negative cash flow in the quarter is typical of our historical performance and reflects the seasonal use of working capital. As evident in the increased ratios on the slide, we now reflect the impact of recent acquisitions and divestitures in the current numbers. We remain committed on effective and efficient use of working capital. Lastly, we continue to guide full year available cash flow of $280 million to $300 million, an increase of 26% to 35% compared to the prior year. I will now hand the call back over to David for an update on our full year 2016 guidance. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Patrick. Please go to slide 12. We are affirming our 2016 guidance for revenue and earnings per share as noted on the slide. Our view of the global markets remain unchanged with better confidence given first quarter performance. The Americas residential markets continue to perform well especially in big box and e-commerce aftermarket segments. And although U.S. GDP growth projections have moderated slightly, we continue to expect slow and steady improvement in our core non-residential markets. Within major institution of verticals, we still expect modest growth in education with flat to modest healthcare expansion. For Americas' revenue, the heavy lifting of our Indianapolis operating center integration is behind us, and I'm confident in our ability to achieve full year organic growth of 5% to 6%. I am pleased with growth delivered in the first quarter from our EMEIA and Asia Pacific regions in support of our full year targets. Our acquisitions are delivering growth and the markets are performing as expected. Please go to slide 13. Let me finish by reiterating that I'm pleased with our first quarter results that deliver organic revenue growth and margin expansion across all of our reporting segments and earnings per share growth of more than 19%. Allegion is executing on our margin improvement in EMEIA, benefiting from our acquisitions and realizing contributions for our new product introductions especially within the electronic segment. Finally, we remain on track and are positioned well to deliver our original guidance. Now, Patrick and I will take your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from Josh Pokrzywinski of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Josh. Tom Martineau - Director- Investor Relations : Josh. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Just on the ERP implementation, Dave, if I understand you right, it sounds like the high-single-digit order growth that you saw in the quarter would have been converted, so the low-single-digit sales would have been closer to high-single digit. I just want to make sure I understand that right just to start. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think you read that properly. As we looked at the quarter, January orders were a bit anemic. We would have liked to see that come in a little bit stronger, and we accelerated through the quarter. We turned on the ERP system February 1. With any kind of start-up that reflects \u2013 that ERP system, 25%, 30% of our Americas volume. We had some start-up issues, it got better through the quarter, and we see continuous improvement every day at Indy operations. And today, our output is eating into our backlog. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: I guess just as that relates to making up the 1Q difference or backlog build, how does that layer out 2Q versus rest of the year? And how do you tie that out, the high-single-digit you're seeing today, to still that low-single-digit outlook that you guys are embedding in the guidance? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So, just a couple of follow-ons, Josh. So, as Dave indicated, it's primarily a timing issue relative to the shipments not a \u2013 what we think is a market share issue. Order activity, probably a little bit north of our full year organic growth expectations that we give 5% to 6% in Americas. The backlog would reflect that. So, I would say maybe another way to look at it is without this, we certainly would have participated well within that range, probably at the higher end of that full year range. So, as we look going forward, we're making good strides of progress. Production is up relative to year-over-year eating into the backlog every day. And so, the thought would be to make it up as soon as possible to get our delivery cycles back to customer demand quickly, but it's probably going to be a Q2, Q3 fully caught up. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got you. And then, just to follow on to that question, I don't know if you answered already, how does that relate to low-single-digit outlook for the year? It seems like orders are a bit ahead of that. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So, order activity is tracking a little bit north of that. The difficult thing to ascertain as it relates specific to our Indianapolis facility is whenever you go out with these changes, you communicate, of course, your customer base. So there maybe some order activity that's trying to get ahead of it, get the products in the queue and so I think it's a little bit too early to adjust our guidance northward. We'll get a better perspective as we progress throughout this quarter. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I would emphasize, too, Josh, we would expect acceleration in this time of the year. As we go into the summer construction season, there's a ramp-up. That's why we implement big changes in ERP in Q1, but that ramp-up is positive and we will give you an update at the end of Q2 how we assess that. Is it better than we thought? But clearly positive about what we see from an incoming order rate. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: All right. Thanks, guys. I'll get back in queue. Operator : The next question comes from Tim Wojs of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. Good morning. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I've got two separate questions. I guess just first on the ERP implementation. Are there any heightened costs associated with trying to get that backlog out or you added more labor, shifts, or anything like that to be aware of on the margin side? And then secondly, could you just comment on some of the treasury proposals around inversions and tax stripping, and how we should think about the ongoing tax rate at Allegion? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So, we have added a little extra labor associated with the implementation. You would have that in any case associated with these transitions, so perhaps a lift in productivity. But in terms of affecting our overall operating results, nothing of significance to highlight there. As you know, those products have very good margins so it shouldn't be an issue going forward. On the proposed legislation, actually a couple of comments there, you're aware that right now, they are \u2013 it is proposed so it's hoping a commentary period. We'll see how it shakes out. But basis of the current proposed legislation, it's all perspective-looking. And so, when we look at the effect on our business, I would say no immediate impact today for 2015 or our planning horizon over the next three to five years. I would also comment on \u2013 relative to the proposed legislation that it has a lot of documentation requirements. We feel like we're fairly buttoned up in this area. You may recall in 2014, we had some incremental investment associated with some external advisors from both the tax and legal perspective. I think we're on a very solid foundation relative to some of those items that these regulations address. Going forward, it does require maybe some more rigor and tax planning strategies, but we've got many tools in our toolbox that we'll continue to execute. The regulations, by the way, are specific to U.S. entities or foreign subsidiaries underneath U.S. entities, so it doesn't impact our every entity within our structure. And it doesn't preclude or eliminate debt transactions with a solid and sound business purpose. So, I just remind you being an Irish-domicile company, I believe we have a very tax-efficient structure. We have a lot of optionality and we have the ability to continue even with these regulations to move cash around the globe tax efficiently. That gives us a competitive advantage. Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Well, that was very helpful color. I appreciate it. I'll hop back in queue. Operator : The next question comes from Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. And, Patrick, thanks for that. That was probably the best answer on the tax question that I've gotten out of all my companies so far, so it's really helpful. More broadly even (25:15). Listen, on Indianapolis, this is a great plant. ERP implementations now, normal inventory build ahead of that. I see this happen \u2013 I used to see things like that happen very frequently. It's very infrequent in large ERP implementation that I see that across my coverage these days. What really happened such that you, guys, were caught off guard and had shipping problems beyond what is a normal planned-for ERP transition even in a complex manufacturing environment? David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, first, we replaced a 29-year-old operating system in our legacy facility. So the change management is huge. We don't underestimate that, but it affects every transaction from order entry to shipment. Some of the challenges were driven by part location and completed product location that has a higher level of rigor than was operated under the old system. Our configured product is also as complex as anything in the industry. So as we take systems and apply it \u2013 I don't care if it's SAP, Oracle. We chose Microsoft AX, these challenge these systems and that's what we faced. I couldn't be prouder of how our people responded to make sure that we met the needs of our customers. And as I look at April, we are cutting into the backlog at a very fast pace. And I would say for the size of this conversion, I think it's \u2013 and the complexity of our business, we've done a credible job to upgrade. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. That is helpful. And what was your electronics growth and penetration? Usually, I think you talked about \u2013 I think it was 28% or something last quarter. Where were you this quarter? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So, sequentially down low-double-digits if you kind of look across the entire portfolio. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, and year-on-year. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So increase year-over-year \u2013 sorry. The increase year-over-year was low-double-digits, okay. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : But sequential down from the reference you mentioned in the 20%s. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Okay. Operator : The next question comes from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Rich. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : On the margin here, so for Americas, was there \u2013 how much negative impact from the conversion here? I mean, there is certainly on the revenue side, but could you quantify the margin impact? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So, as we highlighted a mix impact, some of that being driven from the residential growth, continued strong growth in that business, and that would have a natural mix impact as we kind of experienced a little bit last year but a pretty sizable mix relative to \u2013 within the commercial products. And if you were to look at our volume leverage growth historically \u2013 last year, for example, we delivered 40% for every incremental dollar on revenue. That was way down significantly. I would have expected, again, all things being equal, that we would have been within that range in terms of leverage on incremental revenue. So, pretty big mix impact on our business. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And so, does that moderate in Q2 and then into Q3 so we should see better incrementals also in Q1 level? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. You would anticipate as we eat into the backlog, shipments accelerate, growth, because we're going to make up for some of the difference here in Q2, Q3, you would expect a favorable mix going forward. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then... Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : It's a timing issue. And as those shipments continue to catch up, then we'll have favorability there from a margin perspective, which we didn't see in Q1. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And then, Dave, any concern around the customer \u2013 from a customer standpoint with regards to this in terms of lingering impact, not just on getting the orders shipped and whatnot, but in terms of brand management, brand equity, that sort of thing? Any concern around that? David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I'm always concerned. We did extend lead times. We're fighting those back in. The Von Duprin specification capability has huge staying power. I think you understand that when, either in the replacement market or the spec market, it has significant weight. You just can't go and replace it with something else. The engineer-configured is another aspect of that. I would just \u2013 I got no phone calls, which I think is pretty telling. I'm as available to our customers as I am to you. We communicated of the change that we were going through and they understood the need for us to upgrade our 29-year-old system. So, this business has a lot of credibility with industry-leading lead times. We're going to return to that and we'll provide features and benefits with the new systems that our customers didn't have in the past and I think net-net, it'll be a positive for us. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Last quick one on Europe core margin. What was the core margin in the quarter ex acquisitions? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So, I don't have that information readily available, but the margin accretion, 380 basis points, was driven both from the base business improving as well as the acquisitions which are accretive to the overall European margins. If I were to take a guesstimate here, I'd say it's kind of a 50/50 split in the quarter. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Good morning. Just the first question, really, on pricing and how that relates to Europe. Your main peer had seen European pricing get better; I think you have seen that as well. So, maybe give some context around that. And also give any color as to whether you're seeing Southern Europe construction demand improving recently. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I'll take the demand first. Our 3% growth, we feel good about it. I think it's reflective. We've got a Southern exposure and our organic growth reflects better market opportunities. I'd also highlight better execution by our business, on-time delivery, stronger specification is helping us to gain share in a slightly improving environment. We were able to deliver modest price realization in the quarter, but there's a mix of us being more aggressive, exiting unprofitable business and then just a slight uptick in terms of our overall pricing. Patrick, anything to add to that? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No, I think good progress on the pricing. Not only looking at it holistic by market, but within vertical markets and by customer segments so continuous improvement there and it's good as Dave mentioned. The organic growth, 3%, sequentially better than Q4 last year and it's a good sign particularly in Southern Europe. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. Then my second question would just be on raw materials. I think since you spun out of Ingersoll Rand, you obviously had generally an environment where raw material prices have fallen. So, if you could give us some context as to \u2013 if the recent rise is sustained, how you think about that affecting your gross margins, if at all? And what the sort of best, in inverted commas, \"net price environment\" for you is when thinking about raw materials? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So, as you mentioned, the input costs have come down particularly for us brass, zinc, and steel are large input costs. I think the year-over-year decrease in commodities basis of the current spot rates as you call it around 20% collectively, that was baked in to our full year guidance. We've recently seen a move upward in steel prices so it may put a little pressure there, but you should continue to see deflation in our input cost. One of the great things about this business relative to your comment on pricing, not a significant impact on our pricing strategy, so believe we can continue to execute on that front. And you're not going to see the full benefit of the deflation in the commodity prices because, again, we lock in the supplier contracts and so over a 12-month period. And so, it kind of worked its way out during the course of the year. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And then just what you're thinking, I guess, further back in the business at times when input costs have been rising, again, when you were part of Ingersoll Rand, how was the ability to pass on input cost increases back then? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Very, very good. If you go back, call it after the 2008 recession, you saw a much higher price realization particularly given the rise in the input cost. And so, I think the ability to pass that on to the consumer historically has been good. It depends on particular movements, competition, et cetera, but right now, I'm not anticipating in a rising inflationary situation that we wouldn't be able to do the same going forward. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Kessler of Imperial Capital. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : Thank you. Across the security sectors that we cover in integration \u2013 video access, intrusion \u2013 that we've seen some moderation over the course of the last several periods, several quarters. And yet in the locking area of the mechanical and electronic areas that are specific to you, we've actually seen you've not just maintained, but actually increased growth slightly and margins have improved. Is this something that you are seeing in the marketplace yourselves or also is it your ability to add? If you could discuss this a little bit, new segment such as the multi-family segment to what had been perhaps almost zero in terms revenue, getting \u2013 finding new niches to grow because, again, in other areas where they haven't had those new niches, we've seen some moderation on the more electronic side. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, Jeff, I may not be as intimate on some of the video stuff and keep an eye on it, but go back 90 days ago with our core guidance, we led \u2013 or certainly we're at the top end of the industry in terms of the growth that we saw. I think we're intimate with our key market's demands and clearly see what's happening in the market in terms of the segmentation and niches in our business. And I would say this globally, we see good upside opportunity. I've talked about some of our channel moves. We continue to analyze our market positions and opportunities with \u2013 in our global positioning to go in and better execute and serve growing niches. That would be true for our traditional mechanical businesses, and we continue to see the electronic side of it growing at double to our mechanical markets. And we think things like the multi-family segment that gives customers a perimeter security right down to the apartment door will help us to deliver leading industry growth. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : Okay. Thanks. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think China, this quarter, is a good example. Yes, we're small but a focused business. Target with our capabilities, shows growth in Europe, very pleased with our performance, and I have to make long-term improvements in the ERP systems for our employees and customers. But you look at what went into our backlog; we would've been right at the top of the group in terms of our growth. There's multiple factors working here. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : Okay. I know backlog is not the key KPI in this company, but what are you seeing in the backlog that gives you all the confidence that you seem to be talking about for the second half of the year? What mix is there that is definitely different other than \u2013 apart from the ERP system? David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We clearly see quotations, incoming orders supporting the growth profile that we projected in our annual guidance. Stronger in some of the institutional segments, I think it supports our strength in specification. And then, you've talked to \u2013 or I've talked to you about the retrofit market, better service to locksmiths through our channel plays, those investments continue to exceed our expectations. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : Okay. Great. And by the way, thank you. You had a great presentation at the ISC West Conference. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. We'll keep working on it. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : Yeah. Operator : The next question comes from Jeremie Capron of CLSA. Please go ahead. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Hi. Good morning. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Following up on the disruption at Indianapolis, are you anticipating any major systems upgrade at other lost plants in the near future? David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Our next targeted upgrade would be in France and that would be late fourth quarter so that's \u2013 then as I think about our systems, you need to think about this as an ultramarathon. We clearly created a system \u2013 the Allegion system and our IT systems, our infrastructure was underinvested, but this is not a land race or a rush. We'll very methodically move to a common platform over the next 5 years to 10 years. We think it's important. But we replaced a 29-year-old system. The next system that we'll replace will be a \u2013 it's called a Bull (41:57) system. Probably only old guys like me remember this, but it doesn't have near the scope. But what we installed in Indianapolis is the platform that will replace the Bull (42:11) system. So, logical steps that I think give our people the tools and our customers the capability to expect in a modern marketplace. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. And (42:23) commented on that already on the year, but can you provide an update on your channel initiative and how you plan on rolling this out through the remainder of the year? David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, think of our channel initiatives in terms of the retrofit and renovate and better service to partnerships with locksmiths is in year two of a five-year rollout. We continue to strategically evaluate opportunities to extend our specification capability in the commercial segments. So, there's multiple things working here, but remember in the retrofit/replace market, the locksmith, $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion market that we roll out really over the next three years to five years and pleased with the continued progress. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. Great. And last one for me. Asia, looks like you had a pretty strong organic growth here. Can you comment on where this came from? And also, I was a little surprised not to see a high level of profitability now that the Bocom PC (43:44) got out of the portfolio. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, thanks for noticing that. The growth really comes, number one, with focus. Bocom and the exit of that business was some heavy lifting, distracting in terms of capabilities we have. Second, especially in China, we're attacking specific niches that we think our capability lines up with. Third is the acquisitions. Brio, Milre, FSH are improving our product capability and we think we have a value proposition that will help us to grow in the region. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. What about the profitability levels? What do you think is holding you back and preventing from having scale margins there? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So, you saw a significant step-up in our operating income performance, the acquisitions clearly contributing to that. The region has done a really good job eliminating the stranded cost associated with the divestiture through some reduced head count and really cost containment, those type of things. So first quarter I think in a long time has been at a breakeven. So, sequentially, it will continue to improve throughout the course of the year. We've always said for 2016 kind of mid-single-digit operating income performance for the full year, but putting a path to kind of get us to 10% over our planning horizon. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks very much. Good luck. Operator : The next question is from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Good morning. Just a couple more follow-ups on the ERP, I feel like we're kind of beating a dead horse here. But, David, you did say that this effort impacted, I think, 20% to 25% of your Americas sales. Does this close the work on Americas or we \u2013 so, you told us France is next, but is there a lot more work to do in Americas to get to where you want to be? David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : The long-term goal is a common operating system. You need to think about that five years. We will not do that conversion without a solid business case that delivers a return in productivity. You have to think about aged systems, those types of things. But we believe these systems can enhance our customer capability and our profitability and the business case, in terms of the next steps, got to be there for us to move forward. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And maybe you could address that because we are talking about this as if it's a painful medicine no one wants to take. But maybe you could give us some color on what it means for the speed of product fulfillment, inventory turns, those sorts of things, the reasons you're inherently making this investment. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, historically, we have led our industry in terms of inventory turns, cycle times and profit margin. We think modern tools, Windows-based tools on the floor will continue to give us differentiation on those factors. I think second, it's important that we look at the end customer. Why would I want a common system? I can't ship today on one invoice from our various manufacturing facilities. And customers want this. It's something I think over the long-term planning horizon we've got to plan for. Another dimension of the optics of lead time and the change management happened as we turned on the new system, I mean, clearly we've changed some things and are coming back quickly. But we closed the books financially at a faster pace than we had at any ops ever. I'd like to be able to spend less money on financial consolidation and more on analysis, analysis of our profitability, our customers. So, there's multi-dimensions in terms of these systems, but we'll hold them to a business case and we think we'll drive the things that are important to us : return on invested capital, high inventory turnover, and time. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And, Jeff, so think about it also back office efficiency moving from multiple systems to one common platform. It just provides all kinds of efficiency, better control environment, et cetera, from a finance perspective, order management, so those type of activities, better customer service. So there's a whole spectrum of business benefits not just in the manufacturing floor. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I want to add one other point in terms of benchmarking. As we look on our global IT cost, we're at the upper end of the range. And to get that to the benchmarks that we would like, we think we've got to upgrade these systems. And I'd share that just \u2013 this is how we think in terms of the overall performance of the business. We want superior capabilities, but we also want to make sure that the cost structure that deliver that is in line with other industrial companies. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Maybe one other one question with maybe a lot of elements to it, but just thinking about total investment spend, I would assume the ERP stuff is maybe being capitalized but if you could give us a sense of where investment spending looks to track for the rest of the year. And then I'm also just curious if you do get the related benefits out of ERP that you're hoping for, should we expect that those are actually dropping through to the bottom line? Or is this really a driver of additional investment spending so to speak, that you'd redeploy these savings into something else? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So, on the incremental investment spending, so you're right, a big chunk of that would be captured in capital expenditures and as you capitalize things like license cost, design development, those type of things. So, the bulk of that has already been capitalized relative to our global platform. So, on a go-forward basis, you would have things like any modifications for local, regional requirements or specific maybe to a manufacturing facility, and those would be capitalized. But there's also a core team that's been charged with implementing and executing on the implementation of these that is kind of captured in our corporate expenditure as an ongoing investment. That will continue kind of going forward as we roll out what Dave said on the French implementation and then we'll see kind of going forward. But all that incremental spend has been captured in our full year guidance. And we'll play one year at a time and it depends upon the speed at which we implement and we'll determine how much more or little on that investment dollars. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Please go ahead. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yes. Good morning. A couple things, just quickly on the ERP. The business that you missed there, the shipments that were affected by the ERP implementation, how would that bucket out between specced markets and distribution markets? David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I wouldn't have any factual data, but I would say 50/50. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : 50/50? Okay. Thanks. And then, we haven't really talked about the residential business here. I can follow up with you later on some other ERP stuff, but could you talk about the residential business and what you're seeing? High-single-digit growth sounds pretty impressive. Is this kind of where the market is and you're kind of maintaining your share? Are you gaining share in this channel? If so, where and which products? David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good market. Forecasting says that replace and renovation is going to increase in the year. Remember that we're extremely well positioned to that. Our suite of electronics \u2013 Schlage Touch, Schlage Pulse, Schlage Sense \u2013 I think are giving us good momentum. We are increasing our work with the large builders. We think there's opportunity there, but we want to provide that on value. We want to provide that on builders that want to provide an above opening price point products. We think the market \u2013 the electronics and increased spend in the renovation markets are all \u2013 and then style and design, that was one thing I failed to mention. We have put more SKUs out there and they're all factors that are helping us grow. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : So, would it be fair to say that within residential that margin performance is improving? I mean, above and beyond just the operating leverage with the volume. But through the style and design and the channel selection, are you \u2013 this is a more profitable business for you now. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I would say a slight improvement. We've got price pressures in the market, but we also \u2013 if you visited our Baja facilities, the teams there are doing an outstanding job of driving productivity on the factory floor, value engineering, but just straight execution and throughput. Extremely pleased with those teams. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. One last quick one, if I may. You've got a competitor that's publicly discussed the possibility that may sell to commercial security hardware business. Is that creating a customer migration now that's providing you with share gains? David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I'd always like to think that customers would look at the lack of investment in that product set and our aggressive investment. We're providing better solutions. Uncertainty in the competitive world's always an opportunity for a manufacturer like ours. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Thanks, David. Operator : The next question is from Robert Barry of Susquehanna International Group. Please go ahead. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey, guys. Good morning. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Rob. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Just a few follow-ups at this point. On the investment spending, I think $2 million in Americas in the quarter. Is that the run rate we should expect there for the rest of the year? David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, I'll speak to it in aggregate. Americas being the bulk of the incremental investment spend. It's probably a little bit lighter in Q1. I would expect it to increase slightly throughout the course of the year, Q2 through 4, to be kind of straight line for those quarters. We gave some guidance I think around $0.15 to $0.16 incremental spend relative to our year-over-year investment spend. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got you. And then on the pricing in Americas, it looks like you got a point this quarter. I think that's up from like 50 bps last year even with the mix perhaps working against you. I mean, do you think you can sustain that, maybe even do better than that as the year progresses in Americas? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Well, our hope would be to improve upon it. We like the progress that we saw in Q1, as you pointed out, better out of the gate than last year for the full year. Commercial has been performing well, residential kind of tracking to what we had anticipated. So, we'll see as the year progresses, but so far, a little bit better than what we had anticipated out of the gate but in line kind of with our full year expectations. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got you. And maybe just finally, you have this benefit in the quarter below the line from the sales of marketable securities and then equity investment gains. I think some of that, at least, was in the guide. Can you just refresh our memory how much of that was in the guide and of what's in there, how much might be remaining in the subsequent quarters? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I think a good way to look at that question is if you look at the full year, 2015, we had other income of roughly $10 million to $11 million. Our full year guidance assumed a similar amount for 2016. We did have kind of a onetime benefit in this equity investment that came through, so that maybe a little upside there year-over-year. But that would suggest that the majority of our EPS growth, 7% to 12%, all operational performance improvement predominantly. But the full year guide assumed kind of a similar number for the full year that we experienced last year. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : I'm sorry, the similar number on other income. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Great. Thank you. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Operator : And next, we have a follow-up from Josh Pokrzywinski, I'm sorry, of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hey, guys. Just to follow up on the price cost discussion from earlier. Maybe just to parse out the 120 bps you got in the quarter, I think, overall that you spelled out there in the Q, should we think about that as being a similar number into the second quarter and maybe a little narrower in the second half just based on comps? Or maybe just help to dimension out the seasonality there. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Was your question specific to pricing? I'm sorry. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: The price cost delta. I think you called out in the Q 120 basis points of margin benefit on price cost in the quarter. I would imagine you'll get a similar number in 2Q. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Actually, if things hold the way they are today, you'd see a little increase to that because the deflationary benefits would be a little bit stronger assuming commodity prices track where they're trading today. So, hopefully, we see a little bit improvement in Q2, Q3, then it kind of levels out. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got you. And then just a follow-up on EMEIA since some of the businesses there are still new or new and that we haven't seen them for a full year yet. Maybe on the seasonality, how should we think about that normal 4Q bump relative to kind of a flattish pattern for the rest of the year that you used to have that probably looks a lot different with AXA and SimonsVoss? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So, actually not too much different. Q4 will continue to be our strongest quarter for Europe, Q1 being the lightest quarter, Q2 pretty good, and Q3 because of the holiday period, a little lighter than Q2. But the seasonality is fairly consistent. Even with the margin increase year-over-year lower than what you might expect, remember we have flat amortization expense associated with the intangibles during the course of the year. So that, as the business grows, that kind of levels out and you get improved margins going forward. So, you would expect improved kind of double-digit margins going forward for our European region. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got you. All right. Thanks, guys. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Operator : There are no additional questions at this time. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Martineau for any closing remarks. Tom Martineau - Director- Investor Relations : Thank you. We'd like to thank everyone for participating in today's call. Please call \u2013 contact me for any further questions. Have a safe day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Martineau. Please go ahead. Tom Martineau - Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, Kaye. Good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for the second quarter 2016 Allegion earnings call. With me today is Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and the presentation which we will refer to in today's call are available on our website at www.allegion.com. This call will be recorded on our website. Please go to slide number 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Our release and today's commentary include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of restructuring and acquisition expenses in current year and prior-year results. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior-year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details. Dave and Patrick will discuss our second quarter 2016 results, which will be followed by a Q&A session. For the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and then reenter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone given the time allotted. Please go to slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to Dave. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Tom. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm extremely pleased with the company's second quarter results. We continue to deliver profitable growth that reflects continued execution of our growth pillars as well as the benefits of investments in the business. Revenues of $584.9 million grew 12.6%, reflecting organic growth of 8.9% as well as the benefit of prior-year acquisitions. The Americas had organic growth of 9.8%, which was driven by strong revenue growth in our non-residential business. This included an anticipated shift in revenue from Q1 to Q2 associated with our ERP implementation at our Indianapolis facility. If you recall, we ended the first quarter with elevated levels of backlog associated with the implementation. I am pleased to say we made significant progress in the second quarter through improved throughput and reduced the associated backlog. We caught up on shipments, and I expect a normal flow of shipments for the second half of the year. EMEA organic revenues grew at 3%, and our Asia Pacific business had a very strong organic revenue growth of 12.9%. If we exclude the previously divested system integration business revenues from prior-year amounts, the Asia Pacific business achieved organic growth of 23.6%. Adjusted operating income of $125.7 million increased 24.2% versus the prior year. Overall, operating margin improved by 200 basis points. This is the second straight quarter in which all Allegion regions delivered organic revenue growth and margin expansion, once again demonstrating our ability to efficiently leverage incremental volume. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.99 increased more than 39% versus the prior-year period, driven primarily from improved operating performance, acquisitions and a lower effective tax rate. This is our eighth straight quarter with double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. As a result, we are improving our full-year guidance of organic revenue growth to a range of 5% to 6% and total revenue growth of 8% to 9%. In addition, we are tightening our full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.30 to $3.40 per share. Please go to slide 4. Shifting a bit from the financials, I'm equally pleased with our safety performance of our business. We believe that excellence in safety is a True North metric of enterprise excellence. And having a workforce committed to safety is crucial for continued operational success and delivering shareholder value. As you can see from the chart, Allegion has consistently been a leader among our peers and other manufacturing companies for total recordable incident rates. We incorporate safety in our business system and measure ourselves against annual goals. Year-to-date 2016, we continue to see an improvement of 13% by forecasting on risk and a reduction of injuries at home and at work. Be safe and be healthy is one of Allegion's core values, and providing and maintaining safe work environment is my number one priority. Patrick will now walk you through the financials and I'll be back to discuss our full-year 2016 guidance. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. Please go to slide number 5. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the second quarter. I'll focus on the Allegion results and then cover the regions in their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 8.9% organic growth in the second quarter with contributions from all regions. Each region contributed to price realization as well as volume growth. Foreign currency was a modest headwind in the quarter, while acquisitions contributed approximately $40 million of incremental revenue or 7.7% growth, which more than offset the impact of divestitures. Please go to slide number 6. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $584.9 million, which is a 12.6% increase versus the prior-year period. I was pleased with the revenue growth driven by volume increases, the benefit of acquisitions and organic contributions from each region. As Dave mentioned earlier, our revenue growth reflects increased shipments following our Q1 ERP implementation at our Indianapolis facility. We continue to experience solid electronic product growth, which was up in the mid-teens, and we are realizing the benefits of our new product introductions and channel initiatives. Adjusted operating income of $125.7 million increased 24.2% compared to the prior year. The benefit of strong leverage on incremental volumes helped deliver 200 basis points of margin expansion versus the prior year. All regions delivered improved operating margins and this reflects the fifth straight quarter of year-over-year margin growth. Of note, volume increases in our North America non-residential business contributed to favorable mix in the quarter. I will discuss this in more detail when reviewing the Americas slide. I'd also note that we improved our industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin to 24.2%, an improvement of 260 basis points versus the prior year. All regions improved on this metric in the quarter. Please go to slide number 7. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter of 2015, reported EPS was $0.66. Adjusting $0.05 for prior-year restructuring and acquisition-related expenditures, the 2015 adjusted EPS was $0.71. Operational results increased EPS by $0.18, as leverage on incremental volumes, favorable business mix, productivity and price more than offset inflationary impacts. The unfavorable net productivity in equation reflects the quarterly timing of certain expenditures. And although foreign exchange was the revenue headwind in the quarter, this was offset by our foreign-denominated costs, resulting a slight favorability to EPS when compared to the prior year. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate drove a $0.05 per share reduction versus the prior year. The improvement reflects favorable changes in the mix of income earned in lower rate jurisdictions and the continued execution of the company's tax planning strategies. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added $0.03 in the quarter. Next, interest and other income were a net $0.03 increase to EPS. The higher interest expense is related to the issuance of senior notes in the prior year. Favorable other net items primarily reflects the sale of non-strategic marketable securities. This represents the full liquidation of the securities. Lastly, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new production development and channel management, as well as corporate initiatives were a $0.01 reduction. This reflects an adjusted second quarter 2016 EPS of $0.99 per share, an increase of approximately $0.28 or 39.4% versus the prior-year period. Continuing on, we have a negative $0.01 per share reduction for acquisition and restructuring costs. After giving effect to these one-time items, we arrive at the second quarter 2016 reported EPS of $0.98 per share. Please go to slide number 8. Second quarter revenues for the Americas region were $436.5 million, up 8.6% for an increase of 9.8% on an organic basis. Growth in our electronics products increased 15% versus the prior year, as we continue to see better-than-market growth from this product category in both residential and non-residential markets. The non-residential segment delivered double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. Pricing remains solid, and end markets are performing as expected, with growth in both commercial and institutional areas. Additionally, the second quarter results were inclusive of higher-than-normal shipments at our Indianapolis facility, which underwent an ERP implementation in Q1 and had experienced delays in shipments. On a year-to-date basis, the non-residential segment grew high-single digits. The residential business grew at low-single digits after excluding the divested Venezuela business from prior-year results. Volume growth in new construction builder channels and e-commerce was partially offset by pricing weakness. On a year-to-date basis, the residential segment has grown mid-single digits, consistent with the original market expectations shared during our February call. Americas adjusted operating income of $130 million was up 16.2% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 200 basis points. The margin improvement was driven by strong volume leverage and favorable mix, attributable to the strength of non-residential growth. Overall inflation was largely offset by pricing and productivity in the quarter. The higher inflation reflects some quarterly timing differences. When looking at the year-to-date performance, pricing and productivity more than offset inflation. We would expect this to be the case for the balance of the year, although we are expecting to see some additional commodity inflation pressure in the second half. And as noted in the presentation, investments have been a modest headwind year-to-date. We expect additional investment headwinds to be back-end loaded for the Americas segment. Please go to slide number 9. Second quarter revenues for the EMEA region were $121.6 million, up 44.9% or up 3% on an organic basis. The organic growth reflected solid price realization and good performance across most geographies. Acquisitions delivered approximately $35 million in incremental revenue. We have not seen any meaningful impact from the UK EU referendum vote or Brexit. It's too early to quantify any potential impacts for business or industry, but I would note that the UK sales are historically less than 10% of our EMEA portfolio. EMEA adjusted operating income of $9.3 million increased 116.3% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 250 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margins increased 440 basis points, reflecting continued improvements in the ongoing business transformation as well as contributions from the recent acquisitions, which were accretive to the region's margins. This represents the sixth consecutive quarter with year-over-year margin improvement. Please go to slide number 10. Second quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $26.8 million, down 20% versus the prior-year period. As noted on the slide, the decrease was specific to the divestiture of the system integration business, which drove a $15.2 million reduction in revenues year-over-year. Excluding the system integration business and prior-year numbers, total revenue grew 46.2% and organic revenues grew approximately 23.6%. Most sub-regions performed well, with notable strength in China hardware and Australia and New Zealand. Asia-Pacific adjusted operating income was $2.3 million, which reflects an improvement of $3.7 million versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 1,280 basis points versus the prior-year period. Operating margins improved 830 basis points, excluding the previously divested system integration business and acquisitions. The increase in margin reflects strong volume leverage, cost improvements and year-over-year benefit of divesting the system integration business as well as the acquisitions. Please go to slide number 11. Year-to-date available cash flow for the second quarter 2016 was $84.7 million, a $69.9 million increase versus the prior year. The improvement in available cash flow is primarily attributable to increased earnings, decreased operating cash requirements and lower capital expenditures. As evident in the increased ratios on this slide, we now reflect the impact of recent acquisitions and divestitures in the current numbers. We remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital. And lastly, we continue to guide full-year available cash flow of $280 million to $300 million, an increase of 26% to 35% compared to the prior year. Please go to slide number 12. You will remember our capital allocation strategy that defines a balanced and flexible approach. The company improved its debt to EBITDA ratio to 3 times at the end of the second quarter, in the middle of our targeted long-term range of 2.75 times to 3.25 times. This represents a 0.5 turn improvement over the ratio at 12/31/15 of 3.5 times. The decrease in the leverage ratio is a component of increased EBITDA and normal debt amortization, and demonstrates the ability of our company to de-leverage quickly from profitable growth, low capital requirements and strong cash generation. Additionally, I wanted to highlight that Standard & Poor's upgraded Allegion to investment grade during the second quarter of 2016. We continue to see opportunity to fund incremental investments in organic growth for new product development, channel strategies and enterprise excellence to accelerate core market expansion. Supported by our 2016 performance, we continue to believe these investments will enable the company to grow at an accelerated pace and faster than the broader market with high returns on invested capital. We remain focused on growing our portfolio through acquisitions. During the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of Trelock GmbH. Trelock, a portable safety and security provider producing bicycle locks, lights and electronic control units, strengthens our global portfolio, security and safety offerings. We will continue to evaluate acquisitions that are core to our business and can expand our global footprint and product portfolio and provide a favorable return on invested capital. And lastly, we have the opportunity to provide shareholder distributions through increased dividends and share repurchases. In summary, due to consistent high cash flow generation, we have many options to deploy capital to drive value for our shareholders. I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full-year 2016 guidance. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Patrick. Please go to slide 13. We are improving our 2016 guidance for revenue and EPS, as noted on the slide. We are increasing revenue growth for all regions, given first half performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year. This results in total organic revenue improving a full point versus prior guidance to a range of 5% to 6% and total revenue improving to a range of 8% to 9%. If we look closer at the Americas business, residential market indicators still suggest continued growth. New construction starts are approaching 1.2 million, with resilient strength in the multi-family segment. The residential aftermarket is also performing well, given increased home pricing and low mortgage rates. Non-residential markets continue to perform well and we continue to expect slow and steady improvement in our core non-residential segment. Within major institutional verticals, we still expect modest growth in education and are seeing slight improvement in healthcare aftermarket with an increase in renovation and additions. In the commercial segment, office construction remained strong, driven by employment growth and reduced vacancy rates. The European markets have stabilized and we continue to see modest growth in our core geographies, which is reflected in the increase of our organic guidance. We are still recognizing the benefits of prior-year acquisitions and are leveraging a broader portfolio to accelerate growth. In the Asia-Pacific segment, we continue to make progress with a focus on mechanical and electrical hardware solutions in growth verticals; for example, multi-family in Australia and New Zealand and transportation in China. We are also tightening and raising the low end of EPS guidance, reflecting confidence in achieving the improved top-line outlook. However, we are anticipating some pressure on second half earnings due to the inflationary headwinds, second half weighted investments and a tax rate at the high end of prior guidance. I would also note that our guidance now reflects the inclusion of the Trelock acquisition for the second half of the year. Please go to slide 14. Let me finish by reiterating that I'm very pleased with our second quarter execution and results. As a summary, total revenue grew over 12%, organic revenue grew almost 9%, operating margin increased 200 basis points. EBITDA margins grew 260 basis points. EPS grew over 39%. These are strong numbers. We have increased our revenue growth expectations for the year and have tightened the range for our full-year EPS outlook. Before we take questions, I'd like to take a moment to share some news with regard to an organizational change at Allegion. Tom Martineau will be assuming the role of Vice President of Finance for the EMEA region. As you know, Tom has been in the Investor Relations role since the creation of Allegion. During this time, Tom has established the company's investor relations program and has served as a valuable voice of the shareholder community along with the leadership team. This is a great opportunity for Tom and I'm sure you all want to congratulate him on this exciting move. As we move forward, Mike Wagnes, Allegion's Vice President and Treasurer, will assume the additional responsibilities of Investor Relations. Mike has been with Allegion and Ingersoll Rand for 10 years and brings a wealth of financial experience that will position him well as the company's primary representative to the investment community. Congratulations to you both. The transition will occur over the month of August with formal transition by the end of August. Please continue to contact Tom during this time for any investor-related questions. Now, Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. And congratulations to both Tom and Mike. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well deserved. Thank you. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: My first question maybe, Dave, just touching on your comments on the inflationary headwinds heading into the second half of the year. It looks like you've got a little bit of a lower pricing benefit this quarter than you did in 1Q. And you have your competitor in Europe that has been talking about putting through pricing increases because of these inflationary pressures, even starting as early as next quarter. And so, maybe just talk about your ability to pass on additional pricing increases as we head into the second half of the year? David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So we see inflation on the rise. We think the market remains disciplined and we'll pass the higher costs through. Extremely pleased with the global supply chain's procurement organization that we created here at Allegion. It's driving some productivity in the first half and I think that's how you need to think about the inflation, price productivity take-off as you think about our 2016 results. Patrick has got some comments. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, Joe. So, a couple of quick things. As you saw in the results, Q2 sequentially down a little bit and pricing up, still a pretty good traction in non-resi. The pressure there was more on the residential side. Nothing really out of the normal course of business, but some added costs associated with rebates, advertising, merchandising, credits, those type of things. We would anticipate the back half to improve relative to Q2. So, as Dave mentioned, still anticipate to kind of pass on to the extent we can pricing relative to the increase and inflation. But there is always a lag attached to that. And as it relates to inflation, as you know, I mean the commodity input costs are rising, particularly steel which is up, the last numbers I saw, like 60% relative to the beginning of the year in terms of spot rates. So, that's going to put a little pressure on our numbers in the back half of the year. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That's fair. And maybe one quick follow-up, Patrick. Just on the EMEA margins, still you are continuing to progress there. I think you guys had a double-digit expectation for the year. So I'm just curious whether that's changed at all and just maybe provide a little bit of color around that. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So we're still marching forward to the double-digit expectations in terms of margin performance. I'd say there's a little bit more pressure there in terms of what we originally anticipated, given some of the inflationary headwinds we talked about. We've stepped up some of our investments in the business as well to better position us for growth going forward, particularly as we look at our long-range planning cycle in 2017 and beyond. So, that's going to have a little pressure as well. But if you look at the business in the quarter, good performance; EBIT margins up 250 basis points; EBITDA, 440 basis points. So we like the progress there. We're executing to our margin improvement plan. But maybe a little bit of delay, but collectively a good story. Particularly when you look at where we started the journey, you may recall 2013 was like a 1% EBIT margin. So, significant progress, continue to move forward, probably not as quick as we would like, but yet we're not capitulating on our 10% objective. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Joe, I would add to that, fully committed for double-digit profitability in Europe. I think the execution by the team there and the amount of restructuring that has gone on since we created Allegion is noteworthy. And overall, we're confident that we can deliver that. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Good morning, guys. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Andrew. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hey, Andrew. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And congratulations to Tom and Mike. Tom Martineau - Director- Investor Relations : Thanks, Andrew. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a question on your EPS guidance for the second half. As I look, we have positive top-line growth in the second half. But, basically, your EPS guidance implies no EPS growth or EPS decline in the second half. And I'm just wondering if that's how the math has worked out and we're being conservative or we really do think that there is $30 million, $40 million of incremental cost that's you're going to true-up in the operating improvements in the second of the year. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So I think you've got to look at it and break down the P&L in a couple of segments. We do, as we say, anticipate continued growth both organically as well as including the acquisitions. The continued growth in EBIT/EBITDA margin performance, and that's across all regions in the back half of the year, a little bit increased as it relates to corporate expenditures. But then when you go below the line, it's when the year-over-year comparabilities get very difficult. So you've got \u2013 you may recall, last year, other income was up on the sale of marketable securities. We had a lower tax rate last year because of some favorabilities from one-time items there that are non-recurring this year. And so it's the below-the-line items that are putting the comparisons difficult in the back half of the year. But continued growth, as you would anticipate, in each of the regions for the balance of the year. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : But let me just rephrase the question. Operating leverage in the quarter was in the high-30%s. Do you see a material step down in operating leverage in the second half of the year because of the investments? Because you're describing investments and cost pressures as marginal, but should we see a material decline to the point where we're not going to see any operating leverage in the second half? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So there's going to be operating leverage, not to the extent you saw in Q2, and for the reasons that you mentioned, higher back-end loaded investments. When we initially gave our guidance back at the beginning of the year, we're anticipating $0.10 to $0.15 of investment headwinds. We're a little bit north of that guidance now. Inflationary headwinds is also affecting the numbers a little bit. So, collectively, those items \u2013 or sequentially, you won't see the margin leverage that you saw in Q2. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I would also add, Andrew. We do have a system here at Allegion that helps us to anticipate the future with confidence. I also want the optionality in investments in our business to invest for the long term, and I think this is important as how we guide the company. I think we've been good stewards of that investment, and I don't want to put myself in a position where we can't make the investments in demand creation activities, the pursuit of electronics which we think are good for shareholders over the long haul. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And just a follow-up question. On discretionary retrofit market in the U.S., I know you are working to increase your market share there. Any update on the progress as to what you've seen in the quarter and what impact that has had on organic growth in North America in Q2? Thank you. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We continue to be pleased with our execution in the renovation and retrofit segments of the market. We continue to learn and invest, and it had an impact on the quarter. With that, as we learn and expand there, we're creating new segments to go after within the channel. So it's an example where we're seeing good growth, but we're also investing in more people capacity to segment the markets and drive growth in the business. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Terrific. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. Good morning, and thanks, Tom, for all the help. So my first question would be around the residential business in the Americas. As you said, organic sales growth slowed down a little bit year-on-year in the second quarter versus the first quarter. Was that all pricing or did you see something change in volume as well? And then maybe just give some context around the competitive environment in residential Americas, please. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I would say look at our growth on a full-year basis. We're mid-single digits there, about what we anticipated. I think if you look at the broader community of competitors, there is a price pressure on the opening price point. As I look at our business in the first half, we grew and improved profitability, and don't really want to get sucked into the opening price points of the market. And there is growth there. We just have chosen to play at a higher level. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Very clear. Thanks. And then a quick follow-up just on the Asia business. And obviously, a lot of change in the portfolio there, an acquisition and a big divestment in the past 12 months. How should we be thinking about the pace of improvement in this business in margins over the next couple of years, let's say? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So we had targeted this year kind of mid-single digits. You saw really good performance in the second quarter, a little bit north of that expectation. The business is somewhat seasonal, so you kind of see, particularly in Q4, stronger margins expectations than Q2. Going forward, as the business grows, it will continue to show some leverage. And we're targeting in the near-term horizon have a 10% margin opportunity is where we'd like to see the business go with kind of high-single digits to low-double-digit growth in that business. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Very helpful. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I would add some to that. I think, if you look at our journey in Asia-Pacific, there's been a tremendous transformation in that business. They're focused. They've got the core capabilities of our European product portfolio, our North American product portfolio and are, I think, attacking segments that are helping us drive growth. There's been some smart capital allocation in acquisitions. And I think we've got a bright future as a small player in Asia-Pacific that will benefit us over the long haul. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Jeff Kessler of Imperial Capital. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : Thank you. And again, congratulations to Tom and to Mike. Tom, it's been great working with you. Hopefully we can keep talking from time-to-time. Tom Martineau - Director- Investor Relations : Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : When you take a look at the other segments of the security industry that have been reporting and that have been reporting in mass in terms of what the industry segments are doing, when you look at things like video, when you look at things like overall security integration, those areas have been growing at a little bit of a slower rate than what we're seeing in your area, which is counter to what lots of people have been thinking about, video being the fast grower. Yes, units have been growing, but obviously there's been more price degradation than we've seen on your side because of manufacturing in the Far East. What I'm getting to is what is the reason \u2013 what do you see as a value proposition for driving the growth rate that you guys have in your part of the business at or above other parts of the industry level? David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think it goes back to the mote that we describe around this business and that's the mechanical complexity that we deliver at Allegion in a market that's consolidating. I can look at some direct competitors that are not growing at the pace that we are. Allegion has made investments in our core mechanical as well as electronic. And I think it helps differentiate us versus some of the electronics that have lower barriers to entry. You mentioned that the video market has slowed. Clearly, that market is reaching maturity in some cases. But it's really the number of competitors that are out there. We like our position and we think the growth that we're driving because of the complexity in the investments will reward us. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : Okay. Just as a quick follow-up, can you give some indication of what percentage of your new sales are now coming from what we'll call electro-mechanical or electronic versus just pure mechanical? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So we've grown the overall portfolio in electronic products, as we indicated, up mid-teens for the quarter. That's commensurate kind of with a little bit higher than what we saw in Q1. It continues to be a larger part of our portfolio. It's at kind of the low-teens to mid-teens area as a total percentage of our portfolio. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : Okay. Great. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think too the acquisitions also complement. SimonsVoss, a great add, Milre (38:55), our own presence with Schlage, helps us to understand the important of dimensions for customers and technical evolution around firmware, software, miniaturization and battery life that are going to be important in this industry. You integrate that into our mechanical platform, I think it puts us in a nice position. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : All right. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. And good luck, Tom. Thanks for all the help too and look forward to working with you, Mike. Just on the European margin, so is the 10% core still intact for this year, Dave? David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think certainly within \u2013 it's achievable. It has some pressure, and it's really on the timing and shifting of tooling to lower cost manufacturing areas. So, it's a risk point, but our modeling would say achievable. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Is that a... David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I want you to have \u2013 there's several hundred tools that we're moving, and this is not necessarily a casual activity I would say. So there is some headwinds in the timing, but we believe 10% is achievable. Patrick, can you get... Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Rich, I would just say it's not a question of do we get there. It's more of a timing issue. And as Dave indicated, with some of these moves from a production facility perspective, we'll probably delay the realization of that this year, be pushed into 2017. But the objective remains intact in terms of the end game. And again, collectively, looking at the region as a whole, still pretty good performance. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So, would the guide incorporate something less than 10% in the spread \u2013 in terms of the EPS spread? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Not looking at the region in total, okay? But if you look at the components within the European region, base business versus acquisitions that are accretive to the margins, yes. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. All right. And then, just longer-term on Europe, so does this mean that getting to where Assa is right now, and I know you haven't given formal guidance longer-term on European margins, but does this push out your original thoughts around that on getting to that level or is this just kind of we catch up, there's a time to catch up, and we still think over the longer-term basis we can get to at high-teens type, mid-high-teens margin rate in Europe at some point? David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think you need to target mid-teens. Assa, kaba+dorma (42:04) is who we benchmark to. I think it's also dependent on future acquisitions, but we've made ground up quickly and I think that mid-teens aspirations is achievable. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. All right. And last quick one for me on electronic growth. So, mid-teens, there was a step-up from last quarter low-double digits. Is this the right framework in terms of growth rate going forward or is mid-teens really comfortable with that? David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Comfortable. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Jeremie Capron of CLSA. Please go ahead. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks. Good morning and thanks, Tom, for all your help and the best to you. Tom Martineau - Director- Investor Relations : Thanks, Jeremie. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Question on the outlook for the second half and in the Americas in particular. It seems like your guidance embeds a slowdown in the revenue growth rate. In organic growth, you've been running well above 5% for what two years now, with the exception of the first quarter and the production disruptions. But it seems to me that your guidance embeds something below 5%. Is that correct? And what's driving this pricing slowing down, or any \u2013 because your commentary on the market sounded pretty optimistic. Thanks. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So I think you've got to look at first half, second half. Q2 was abnormally high, given some of the catch-up relative to the ERP implementation, which we now have behind us. But you kind of look at the first half, mid-single digits. Second half, slightly lower than that. So your comment is correct. Predominantly because, last year, we had difficult \u2013 or we had really strong quarters, particularly in the residential business where we had some load-ins on new products. You may recall the launch of the Schlage Sense product, which was a big driver in Q4 in particular last year. So, that's kind of what we're looking at. Difficult comparisons. But the core business will continue to grow. Again, we're making really good traction on our initiatives in terms of some of the new product launches. The channel initiatives Dave talked about, the retrofit opportunity, we're getting good traction there. So it's more about more difficult comparisons in the back half of the year. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Understood. And going back to the topic of commodities and middle prices going up, can you maybe help us quantify the potential impact and maybe help us understand a breakdown of your bill of materials? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So I won't get into the specifics in terms of bill of materials. But we had commented previously, raw commodity cost of roughly 10% of our material purchases, steel being probably 50% of that. So, that's the biggest commodity input. That's the biggest mover that we've seen recently. If you try to quantify it, it's probably putting on additional pressure $0.02 to $0.03 in the back half of the year. We managed that through supply lock contracts, but everything is not hedged. And so, the unhedged portion kind of flows through the business as we purchase those components. Additionally, obviously you've got from our supply base, they're buying the same inputs and so you've got pressure in terms of potential cost increases from our suppliers that also come into the equation. But we'll continue to manage it and offset it. As we said earlier, we have the mechanism to try to do that through pricing. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Great. And maybe just last one for me. I noticed the increase in working capital as a percentage of revenue. Should we consider this as transitory? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So we continue to focus on working capital. A couple of things worth noting here. The acquisitions, so the businesses we've acquired, predominantly being European based, have higher working capital needs and that's distorting the year-over-year comparatives. If you kind of back that out, we're at about 5% working capital as a percentage of revenue, about 50 days cash conversion cycle. So there is some of impact of the acquisitions which, hey, look, we'll continue to drive that and look for ways to become more efficient. Secondly, as it relates to some of these facility moves and the ERP implementation, you carry higher inventory and safety stock. So, as we make those transitions, effectively we'll burn more inventory. And so the numbers should come down. But longer-term basis, I would anticipate us to be able to operate effectively, efficiently at about a 5% working capital as a percentage of revenue. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I would reinforce about our ability to be as efficient. I would add that Patrick's comments is the peak of the construction season. This business leverage is incredibly, don't want a lack of material or finished inventory to inhibit our ability to drive revenue. And there's clearly a shift in philosophy about that with Allegion. Have our product available at our wholesalers, in our warehouses, and continue to drive our industry-leading lead times, and it helps us to grow. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you. Tom Martineau - Director- Investor Relations : And I would like to comment \u2013 Thanks, Jeremie. And this is Tom. I would just ask, let's try to keep the question maybe to one question the rest of the way. We're going to run pretty tight today. Operator : The next question is from Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Peter Richard Lennox-King - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Oh, hi, everybody. This is Peter on for Steve. Could you maybe talk through, put a bit of a finer point on \u2013 within the Americas for Q2, how much of the growth was actually from ERP catch-up and therefore sort of one-time in nature? And any dynamics we should be expecting from there? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. You may recall, Americas I think was essentially flat in Q1 and we anticipated kind of mid-single digits last quarter. Q2, we caught up predominantly on the shortfalls related to the ERP implementation and in the ops. So, great progress there. That's why you saw the really high organic growth. I'm not going to give you a specific number, but just to say, we've gotten all of that kind of behind us. You may recall, we had anticipated it would be a 50%/50% split Q2/Q3. So we're now at a normal run rate I think going forward. But it did impact kind of the organic growth, let's say, maybe 3 to 4 points. Tom Martineau - Director- Investor Relations : Yeah. And I would say the first quarter was kind of low-single digits was the growth rate. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Overall, I'd guide you to look at our first half year-over-year. And what I'm pleased with that we're seeing growth in all of our business lines, closers, locks, exit devices, and I think it shows the strength of the market. Peter Richard Lennox-King - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great. And actually, if I could just sneak in a follow up. I had thought that in Q1 that absent the ERP impact that electronics growth was in the high-teens, and so excluding the ERP, and it was higher before that in 2015. Is that a slowing or is it just sort of steady as she goes and the dynamics are actually pretty consistent? David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think you need to think about this as mid-teens. Remember, we've had a lot of new product introduction over the last several quarters. Globally, this is forecasted to grow at high-single digits. So I think our mid-teens reflects our execution and how you ought to think about that. Peter Richard Lennox-King - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks very much. Operator : The next question comes from Tim Wojs of Baird. Please go ahead. Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. Good morning. Hey, Tom, it's been great working with you, and congrats on the role. Tom Martineau - Director- Investor Relations : Yeah. Thanks, Tim. Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): My question is really just on M&A. And I guess I'm curious how are you feeling about the cadence of M&A this year, and how do we think going forward what your ideal cadence is? And I'm just asking because last year you did maybe five acquisitions and year-to-date you're closer to one. So I'm just curious how the pipeline looks and how you guys could kind of think about the ideal cadence of M&A going forward. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Obviously, we'd like more. It's a function of availability, timing. We continue to work on the pipeline, the relationship building. And it's the nature of the beast. Sometimes these come in dumps and lumps. But the overall market, the relationship we're building, we feel good about. What's the level of revenue we'd like to add? I'd like to think $50 million to $200 million on an annualized basis would be a nice cadence. But I want to remind you we're going to be disciplined in the capital deployment and bolt on what's right for Allegion. So, that's how I'd describe it. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Tim, I would just add. Continue to be selective, make sure it's aligned with our core business and strategies, things that we can leverage well to get a good return on capital. And hey, we're just as busy as we were last year. We're looking at a lot of potential properties at various stages, and it just depends. We're not going to overpay for anything. We're going to stick to our knitting and buy some good businesses. Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. That's helpful color. I appreciate it. Nice work, guys. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Congrats to Tom. Maybe, condolences to Mike. It sounds like he's getting two jobs for the price of one, but look forward to working with you. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No good deed goes unpunished for both of these guys. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Exactly. I'll keep it to one question. I know we're up against the wall here. Just on the balance sheet, I don't think you were ever actively seeking an upgrade to investment grade. I just wonder if that now, though, colors your thinking on the balance sheet at all. Or in your discussions in achieving that upgrade, are the rating agencies comfortable with you at least flexing up to that 3.25 times? Maybe they're even comfortable with you flexing higher than that with visibility to bring it down. Just give us some perspective on your thoughts around that and if there is any change in thinking at all about the balance sheet? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No changes at least in the near term. We've been very transparent with our financial policies with the rating agencies from day one, and nothing has changed from that, as you're aware, relative to our capital allocation strategy. So the upgrade came on basis of the strength in our franchise and prospects going forward, strong cash generation, good growth prospects, EBITDA consistency, margin profile. All those type of things I think factored in the upgrade. And I think it's a benefit for us kind of going forward and looking at financings, and hopefully, we can take advantage of. But no changes relative to our long-term debt to EBITDA, which we kind of had targeted 2.75 times and 3.25 times. And, hey, if we find a good opportunity, transaction in the horizon, it doesn't mean we can't go north of that. And we've communicated that with the rating agencies as well. They understand that. The beautiful thing about our business is we do de-lever very quickly, given the strong margin profile and the cash generation. So they're all aware of that and it came on the heels of that information. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Understood. Thanks. Operator : And the final question comes from Robert Barry of Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey, guys. Good morning. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thanks for fitting me in and congrats to Mike and Tom. A quick housekeeping item. I think you mentioned the target for investment spending is higher now. Did you or could you say what it is? And then my question was really on pricing. This fall off in Americas, especially given, I think, like the growth mix was in your favor, right, with non-res much stronger than resi. So, just curious where the pressure is coming from and to be clear on what you think is going to improve the pricing as we go forward. Thanks. Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So, on the investment spending, we had incurred \u2013 there was about a $0.04 headwind in the first half of the year. We're looking at $0.12 in the back half of the year pretty much evenly split, Q3, Q4. So we're stepping up the investment spend. Some of that was planned for, but was delayed in the first half of the year. So, that's kind of how that's going to play out. And relative to the pricing, we would, as I mentioned earlier, this quarter experience some unfavorable pricing in the resi segment. Would expect that to abate a little bit in the back half of the year and that's where you get the improvement in pricing. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : And what's driving the abatement? Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Less rebates and advertising, merchandising credits, those type of things. Discounts, I would say. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. All right. Thank you. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Martineau for closing remarks. Tom Martineau - Director- Investor Relations : We'd like to thank everyone for participating in today's call. Please contact me for further questions. And for my last time, please have a safe day. David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Tom. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode.[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Wagnes. Mr. Wagnes, please go ahead. Mike Wagnes : Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for the third quarter 2016 Allegion earning call. With me today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and the presentation, which we will refer to in today's call, are available on our website at www.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website. Please go to Slide number two. Statements made on today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements, and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results. The Company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Please go to Slide number three. Our release and today's commentary include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impacts of impairment, law fund divestitures, restructuring and acquisition expenses in current and prior year results. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details. Dave and Patrick will discuss our third quarter 2016 results, which will be followed by a Q&A session. For the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and then re-enter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone given the time allotted. Please go to Slide four and I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave Petratis : Thanks Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with the Company's third quarter results. We continue to deliver profitable growth that reflects continued execution of our growth pillars as well as the benefits of investments in the business. Third quarter revenues came in at $581 million growing 6.7% over prior year and reflecting organic growth of 5% as well as the benefit of prior year acquisitions. Americas had organic growth of 5.6%, which was driven by solid revenue growth in our non-residential business. Europe organic revenues grew at 1.6% and our Asia-Pacific business grew at 7.3% organically. If we exclude the previous fully divested systems integration business, revenues from prior year amounts, the Asia-Pacific business achieved organic growth of 10.6%. Adjusted operating income of $126.7 million increased 8.4% versus the prior year. Overall, operating margin improved by 30 basis points, driven by continued price realization, volume leverage and favorable mix, which was more than offset by incremental investments, which was the headwind of 70 basis points. Americas and Asia-Pacific saw year-over-year improvement and adjusted operating margin with Europe being slightly down. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.93 increased slightly versus the prior year period and driven primarily by improving operating performance. As a result, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of organic revenue growth to a range of 5% to 6% and total revenue growth of 8% to 9%. In addition, we are updating and tightening our full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.38 to $3.43 per share. This EPS guidance is inclusive of an estimated $0.03 impact from adoption of a new accounting standard for stock-based compensation in the fourth quarter of 2016. Please go to Slide five. Shifting a bit from the financials I would like to talk about the electro-mechanical convergence in the industry and one of our upcoming product launches. With our pioneering brand and emphasis on innovation, Allegion continues to lead our industry in electro-mechanical convergence and innovation. Electro-mechanical convergence doesn't mean we're asking customers to completely convert to electronics security products. We encourage them to use electronic solutions to complement the mechanical. We're discussing both mechanical and electronic to enable the optimized balance in addressing the physical security needs and unique applications that are secure, cost-effective and convenient to use. The latest addition to the Schlage lock family, the LE Series, exemplifies the electro-mechanical convergence in a commercial environment. This connected mortise solution will complement our Schlage NDE Series for doors with cylindrical prep and Schlage Control for deadbolt applications, all part of our ENGAGE Connected platform strategy. The locks are able to work with the systems that end users already have in place to extend the benefit of electronic access control to more doors deeper inside the building. Schlage Control NDE and the LE Series locks can also be managed as an off-line solution, with the ENGAGE mobile app. This provides building owners and access control solutions that are simpler and more cost effective to manage their mechanical keys alone. Allegion will continue to embrace electro-mechanical convergence, balanced, seeing convenience and security through products like Schlage NDE and LE Series, Schlage Control for multifamily, and Schlage Sense and Connect for single-family residential applications. Patrick will now take you through the financial results and I'll be back to discuss our full-year 2016 guidance Patrick Shannon : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. Please go to Slide number six. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the third quarter. I'll focus on the Allegion results and then cover the regions in the respective slides. Total reported revenue growth was 6.7% for the quarter. As indicated, we delivered 5% organic growth, with contributions from all regions. Each region also contributed to both price realization as well as volume growth. Foreign currency was a slight headwind in the quarter, while acquisitions contributed approximately $26 million of incremental revenue, or 4.9% growth, which more than offset the impact of divestitures. Please go to Slide number seven. Reported net revenue for the quarter was $581.1 million, which is a 6.7% increase versus the prior year period. I was extremely pleased with the solid organic growth from Americas and Asia. In addition, the acquisitions completed in the past 12 months have contributed nicely to revenue growth, particularly in the EMEIA region. Adjusted operating income of $126.7 million increased 8.4% compared to the prior year. The benefit of modest margin expansion on incremental volumes net of incremental investments helped deliver 30 basis points of improvement versus the prior year. This reflects the sixth straight quarter of year-over-year margin growth. Of note, volume increases in our Americas non-residential business contributed to favorable mix in the quarter. I'll discuss this in more detail when we're viewing the Americas slide. I'd also note that we improved our industry leading adjusted EBITDA margin to 24.5%, an improvement of 80 basis points versus the prior year. All regions improved on this metric in the quarter. Please go to Slide number eight. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2015, reported EPS was a loss of $0.28. Adjusting $1.20 for the prior year loss on divestitures, restructuring and acquisition-related expenditures, the 2015 adjusted EPS was $0.92 per share. Operational results increased EPS by $0.14, as leverage on incremental volumes; favorable business mix, productivity and price more than offset inflationary impacts. The unfavorable net productivity inflation reflects the quarterly timing of certain expenditures. And although foreign exchange was a revenue headwind in the quarter, this was offset by our foreign-denominated cost, resulting in a slightly favorability of EPS when compared to the prior year. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added $0.01 in the quarter. Next, interest and other income were a net $0.05 decrease to EPS. The higher interest expense is related to the issuance of senior notes in the prior year. The unfavorable other net items primarily reflects the positive impact from the sale of non-strategic marketable securities last year. The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate drove a $0.05 per share decrease versus the prior year. The increase in rate is due to the favorable resolutions to uncertain tax positions in 2015, partially offset by favorable changes in the mix of income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions. Lastly, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities or new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives were a $0.04 reduction. This results in adjusted second-quarter 2016 EPS of $0.93 per share, an increase of approximately $0.01, or 1.1% versus the prior year period. Continuing on, we have a negative $0.91 per share reduction for impairments, restructuring and acquisition related expenditures. Third-quarter 2016 results included an impairment charge of $84.4 million, or $0.87 per share, primarily related to the receivable recorded as consideration for the previously divested system integration business in China. The impairment write-off reflects our belief that the remaining receivable left on the books when the business was divested was no longer collectible. Divesting the system integration business was an important step, improving our portfolio. However, collection of our receivable has been difficult given the deteriorating business conditions and the core performance of divested business. After giving effect to these items, we arrive at the third quarter of 2016 reported EPS of $0.02. Please go to Slide number nine. Third-quarter revenues for the Americas region were $436.2 million, up 4.1%, or an increase of 5.6% on an organic basis. The non-residential segment delivered high single-digit revenue growth in the quarter. Pricing remained solid and strength across the non-residential product portfolio rose to solid growth. The residential business grew at low single digits after excluding the divested Venezuelan business from prior year results. Favorable volume growth and new construction builder channels was partially offset by weakness in the retail channel. On a year-to-date basis, the residential segment has grown mid-single digits. America's adjusted operating income of $132.3 million was up 8.3% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 110 basis points. The margin improvement was driven by strong volume leverage, pricing and the favorable mix attributable to the strength of non-residential growth. Overall price and productivity more than offset the impact from inflation and incremental investment. We do see higher commodity prices in the third quarter and expect that additional commodity inflation pressure to continue. As noted in the presentation, investments were a 60 basis point headwind in the quarter. We expect additional investment headwind to continue for the remainder of the year. Please go to Slide number 10. Third-quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $116.4 million, up 27.2%, or up 1.6% on an organic basis. Acquisitions delivered approximately $25 million in incremental revenue. EMEIA adjustments operating income of $7.3 million increased 23.7% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 10 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 170 basis points. The base European business showed margin expansion in the third quarter. This was offset by margin deterioration related to the recent Trelock acquisition, driven by seasonality in their markets and operating performance being below expected levels. Although margins declined slightly in the quarter, we anticipate operating income and margin improvement to continue in Q4 and closed the year with record performance for Allegion. Similar to the Americas region, price and productivity more than offset impacts from inflation and incremental investments for Europe. During the third quarter, we did begin to see an impact from the UK/EU referendum vote for Brexit. We saw an unfavorable impact, both on the topline revenue as well as operating income. On a year-to-date basis, the adjusted operating margin is up 200 basis points for the EMEIA region. Please go to Slide number 11. Third-quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $28.5 million, down 16.4% versus the prior year period. As noted on the slide, the decrease was specific to the 2015 divestiture of the system integration business located in China, which drove a $10.6 million reduction in revenues year over year. Excluding the system integration business and prior year numbers, organic revenues grew approximately 10.6%. Most sub regions performed well, with notable strength in Australia and New Zealand. Asia-Pacific adjusted operating income was $1.8 million, which reflects an improvement of $1.1 million versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 420 basis points versus the prior-year period. The year-over-year operating income and margin improvement was driven by the impact of the system integration business divestiture in 2015. Please go to Slide number 12. Year-to-date available cash flow for the third quarter of 2016 was $152 million, a $53.3 million increase versus the prior year. The improvement in available cash flow is primarily attributable to increased earnings. Working capital, as a percent of revenues and the ratio for cash conversion cycle, has increased slightly in 2016. We remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital. And lastly, we are raising our guidance for full-year available cash flow to approximately $300 million, the high end of our previous guidance of $280 million to $300 million. This represents an approximate increase of 35% compared to the prior year. I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2016 guidance Dave Petratis : Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide 13. We are reaffirming our 2016 guidance for revenue and updating and tightening our guidance for EPS, as noted on the slide. Total organic revenue guidance remains at a range of 5% to 6%, and total revenue remaining at a range of 8% to 9%. If we look closer at the Americas business, non-residential markets continue to perform well and we expect slow and steady improvement in our core non-residential segment. Modest growth is expected in institutional verticals and solid growth in commercial markets. Residential market indicators still suggest continued growth, as new housing starts remain stable but still remain below historical average, with resilient strength in the multi-family segment. Strength in the housing is offset by challenging conditions in big-box retailers. European markets have stabilized and we continue to see modest growth in our core geographies, which is reflected in the increase in our organic guidance and are leveraging our broader portfolio to accelerate growth. In Asia-Pacific, we continue to make progress with a focus on mechanical and electrical hardware solutions in growth verticals. We are tightening our EPS guidance by raising the low end of the range. We are also updating both ends of the guidance for an estimated $0.03 impact related to the adoption of accounting standards for stock-based compensation. With these changes, we are guiding full-year adjusted EPS at $3.38 to $3.43 compared to guidance of $3.30 to $3.40. As we look to 2017, we see markets remaining steady, with modest expansion globally. North American markets are expected to continue to be solid while European markets are expected to be modest. Additionally, we see growth potential in the Asia-Pacific markets that we participate in. Please go to Slide 14. Let me finish by reiterating that I'm very pleased with our third quarter execution and results. As a summary, total revenue grew close to 7%. Organic revenue grew at 5%. Operating margin increased 30 basis points. It was a sixth straight quarter with year-over-year margin improvement. EBITDA margin grew by 80 basis points. EPS grew year over year despite below the lowering pressure. These are strong numbers. We are reaffirming our revenue growth expectations for the year, have tightened the range for our full-year EPS outlook and have adjusted our available cash flow guidance to the high end of our prior range. Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Tim Wojs with Robert W. Baird. Tim Wojs : Hey, guys good morning. Dave Petratis : Hey Tim. Tim Wojs : I guess, my question just expand a little bit on your thoughts on the end markets. I mean, there's a lot of mixed data points and cross currents that are kind of going on with construction data lately. So could you talk a little bit to your confidence in some of the non-risk growth that you're seeing? And then if you could split it out maybe between commercial and institutional, what you maybe think preliminarily into 2017? Dave Petratis : As I stated, we remain positive on 2017. As we look at our core activity, our backlogs going into the year, these are positive. Had spent some time over the last few weeks working with our forecasting team, our outside advisors, and see a positive expansion in the institutional markets as we move into 2017, see some improvement in healthcare. There's some spots of weakness in commercial, but we're net positive. I think second, our attack on segmentation in the market is servicing us well. This is the tenant retrofit/replacement light commercial markets. We think even if the market would soften, which I'm not suggesting, that there's enough self-help out there, convergence that we can put in, growth aspirations that are in line with our long term plan. Tim Wojs : That's great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Steven Winoker : Thanks and good morning all. Dave Petratis : Good morning. Steven Winoker : I'd love to get some more detail and color around the EMEIA progress, restructuring, margin expansion, just in light of the performance that I thought came in a bit low versus, at least what I was expecting. So just help us understand the different puts and takes around it. Dave Petratis : Yes, sure, Steve. As you are aware, Q3 normally seasonally is a weaker quarter given some of the shutdowns in the European area. As you mentioned, it was a little bit disappointing to us, I'd say a couple of factors to that specifically. One was, as you are aware with a facility closure we announced last year, moving from Italy to a third party supplier is taking a little bit longer than what we had originally anticipated. We're still getting some benefits, but not getting as much as we had anticipated in the quarter and the year. It's more a timing issue as we finish that transition. At the beginning of next year, we will fully realize the benefits there. Secondly, in conjunction with the acquisition of Trelock completed at the end of Q2, start off problems, the seasonality of the business is lower in Q3. A couple of operational hiccups. Not a big business, but weighed on the margin expectations. A little bit of inflation headwinds as well but I think more importantly, I look at it and step back and say, is the region off on the right trajectory? And the answer is yes. We finished the quarter with really strong backlog and it was one of those quarters that started out slow. It continued to progress positively in the back half of the quarter, so we ended the quarter with strong backlog that supports an improvement in organic growth, sequentially and year over year for Q4, and we would expect the margin dollars and margin improvement to continue in Q4 as what you're seeing historic in the last several quarters. And I would just remind you historically when we started this journey three years ago, it's been -- we had in EBIT margin of like 1% and now we're marching towards the objective of 10% and going forward, we would expect kind of continuous improvement going forward, so... Steven Winoker : Are you expecting anywhere near the same magnitude as you start to think about, I don't know, just a little bit longer time period, if you think about last 12 months versus next 12 months or how should we think about that timing of that? Dave Petratis : In terms of what specifically... Steven Winoker : In margin, I'm sorry. Margin expansion, specifically. Dave Petratis : So I think you won't see quite the improvement as what you've seen obviously the last couple of years but there will continue to be improvement, and the margin going forward as we look at the 2017. That's going to come from continuous improvement and productivity, operational excellence, getting some more synergies from the acquisitions that we completed last year and those type of things. The broader market, our larger competitors run between 10% and 15% OI. We're going to be there and we're going to continue to march towards the high end of the range. As we improve the portfolio, strengthen our customer value proposition, we think we're a credible player in that market versus our peers Steven Winoker : Okay and just quickly, what was the electronics growth rate overall? It was mid teens last quarter... Dave Petratis : Yes, higher than what you saw in our overall growth numbers, so with this electro-mechanical convergence growing faster than mechanical. I think on a year-to-date basis, we're up low teens area so it continues to drive faster growth than the traditional business Steven Winoker : So I know it was low teens and -- or roughly low teens in Q1, mid-teens in Q2. If you're saying it's low teens year to date, you're saying it's somewhere between low and mid in this last quarter, just to put a final point on it? Dave Petratis : Yes. Steven Winoker : Okay and anything accelerating in there? Within resi or non-resi? Dave Petratis : Yes, I would say it's a steady growth. We, on the resi side, the electronics adoption continues to expand, seeing really good growth there. The non-residential segment as well so I wouldn't characterize it as significant growth. Remember last year, we had some load ends, particularly on the Schlage Sense product that we introduced in the back half of the year and so that's making the comparisons a little bit more difficult year-over-year. You need to think about this. The mechanical business low single digits, the electronic business globally at high single-digits, so let's say 8%; and I think mid-teens improvement over the long-term in the electronics is a pretty good place to be. Steven Winoker : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Hey, thanks good morning guys. Dave Petratis : Good morning. Joe Ritchie : So I may have missed it in the last question that Steve asked, but the trend in the 4Q, it looks like the guidance implies America is up 3% to 5%. Is there just some conservatism that you guys are baking in there or did trends actually change at all as you guys progressed through the third quarter? Dave Petratis : This business naturally winds down as we run into the fourth quarter. I think we're looking realistically at the Americas growth in terms of what it will deliver. I would just add, again, our guidance didn't change in America's and so it was expected that sequentially the growth would be down in Q4 relative to Q3, and again, difficult comparisons, particularly on the residential, we had a lot of load ends associated with our new electronic locks in the residential Schlage Sense products, so that was a primary driver there at comparisons. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That makes sense. I guess, maybe one last question. On free cash flow, you guys are making some good progress this year, I know it\u2019s the kind of longer-term goal to get to 100% conversion, can you talk a little bit about that and the opportunities that may present themselves in 2017? Dave Petratis : Yes, so the expectation is that we would remain at 100% conversion ratio. You've seen that over the last couple of years. You're aware, obviously, that if you kind of look at the components of our cash flow, not a heavy capital requirements. CapEx, we would expect to be, call it, 2% of revenue. Believe we can kind of maintain that level. Working capital, we've done a really good job to accelerate the velocity and turnover of receivables and inventories and so see a 5% to 6% revenue type number there. And so, even with growth continuing going forward, we would expect that we could maintain kind of the 100% conversion ratio, 2017 and beyond. Patrick Shannon : I would add the Allegion model is set up for cash flow. We have made investments in the business in inventories to support ProExpress new regional warehouse locations and we're continuing to improve the cash flow characteristics of the business. I think we've got a good handle on the equation and that goal of 100% of net earnings is important to our team. Joe Ritchie : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Thanks you. And the next question comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital. Jeff Kessler : Hi. Thank you for taking the call. How you're doing guys. Dave Petratis : Good Jeff. Jeff Kessler : Can you dive down into a little bit into the types of investments that you're going to be making. Clearly, you're keeping that investment level at a fairly high rate and the return on that investment, obviously, has been pretty good up to this point, but what are you -- going forward, what type of things are you looking at putting money into? Patrick Shannon : Without showing all my cards, remember we continue to attack the $1.6 billion U.S. market opportunity that we call part of the retro -- repair, renovate light commercial space. Our first move was really after the retrofit and renovate with mid-priced point products that's supported by ProExpress. The next move is more target that light commercial space. We're lightly stacked, fast-moving general contractor decision-makers, is where we think we can harvest some growth, Jeff. Dave Petratis : I would just add, too, Jeff, this electronics and the electro-mechanical conversion, particularly on resi and the ability to accelerate the rate of adoption, so you'll see more investment dollars for demand creation, whether it be merchandising, advertising, those type of things on the resi side, continue to invest in our NPD to accelerate New Product Development. Get a higher vitality index is important to us. And like you said, we're seeing incremental revenue growth, a little bit faster than market, and the return on capital on these investments are significant. Very quick cash-on-cash payback and so we'll continue to make the investments to drive top-line growth and return on capital for our shareholders. Jeff Kessler : Okay. Related to that question, just quickly, mortise versus cylindrical. What's going on there? You have a new product out. How is -- how do you want to balance those two? Dave Petratis : We'll balance based on the opportunity that specifiers in the market gives us. You go into the market like Dallas. We really drove that mortise application, so we think adding the LE with the mortise capability and continue to expand a full range of electronic products will help us complement the spec capability and renovations capability that we have in the marketplace. Jeff Kessler : Okay. Thank you. Dave Petratis : Yep. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research Group. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning guys. Dave Petratis : Hey, Josh. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Just on the -- on some of those residential investments that you talked about, Patrick, that I think -- or even targeted in the fourth quarter, if I remember some of your higher comments right. Any expectation that you would see a pull-through in residential or some sort of acceleration in demand off of this bit of this decel [ph] that we had in the third quarter as a function of that investment? Patrick Shannon : The types of investments that we will be making in terms of trying to prime the market will be cumulative over time. We think with the electronic convergence and style and design, we have to create market demand and it will build as that awareness grows. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got you. So, not all at once, and maybe a 2017 opportunity. Patrick Shannon : I've always said with our Schlage Sense, I want 200 every Christmas tree. That might be Christmas 2018 but this is part of what we're trying to drive in the marketplace. When I go to my college dorm, I can use a credential, a smartphone to get in. When I got home, why isn't my home better connected? And that's what we're trying to move. Second would be style and design. Look at like some of the DIY shows. They're upgrading the whole house and missing the hardware. This is movement that we're trying to make happen in the marketplace. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got you. That's good color. And then just thinking about more broadly, the 4% to 6% growth algorithm that you guys have over time. When I think about the major inputs into that, between share gains on the $1.6 billion retrofit market; electronic growth, which sounds like its holding in, if not accelerating, again with some of the initiatives you just spoke to. Any reason to believe that, that algorithm will be different into next year, just based on what you're seeing and kind of the broader end market demand, the elements that I didn't just mention, as it relates to that forecast in the next year? Does anything about that look different than it did in 2016? Dave Petratis : I don't see it. I never want to get my head in front of my skis. We'll spend some time with you in the first part of next year at our Investor Day to sharpen our perspective on this. I think the Company is well-positioned. I think that the segmented approach that we're taking to the market will export to Asia and Europe and trying to create our own capability that I think our range expectation for growth is in line with what we can deliver. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got you. That's helpful. If I could just sneak one more in on the EMEIA margins, what would those have looked like in the quarter absent some of the moving pieces that you talked about there, Patrick, particularly on Trelock? Patrick Shannon : Absent Trelock, it would have been up 100-plus basis points. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got you. That's helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo. Rich Kwas : Hi. Good morning everyone. Patrick Shannon : Good morning, Rich. Rich Kwas : I wanted to just follow up as we think about 2017. Dave, appreciate your broad comments about underlying demand expectations, and the market. Some of the margin -- it sounds like EMEIA, in terms of improvements, is going to be more of a grind than initially thought. When you think about price cost and then investments, recollection was that you put through some price or started to put through some price but you had some negative impact or expected negative impact on commodity here in the second half. Where did that end up? How are you thinking about next year? Are you putting through price now? And then in terms of investment spend, could we just true up at $0.10 to $0.15, which is the initial target for spend for this year? You talked about impact this quarter. How should we think about framing that for 2017, at least relative to what your target was for this year? Patrick Shannon : Yes, so on the target this year, I mean you're right. We had range of $0.10 to $0.15, probably mid to high point of that for the full year, so you're going to see a step-up sequentially in Q4 relative to Q3. We're still in the throes of our 2017 annual operating plan and so no specific color on that. We'll continue to invest in the business, if we think it's a good return on capital, and we can drive accelerated growth faster than the broader market, so more to come on that on the next call. Relative to the price inflation and investment equation, I mean, we've always said that we manage the business to ensure that if you look at those components, those inputs, you try to net those out to zero so that -- of the effect of incremental volume, you get margin expansion. That's the financial model that we are trying to drive. You saw that in the quarter. You've seen in the last six quarters, and that's the continuing expectation. To the extent inflation rises faster, and we're seeing that in some of the inputs, particularly on steel, which is up like 40% relative to where we ended Q2, the expectation over an extended period of time, is we'd be able to offset that in price. We've done that historically. There's always going to be a timing gap. You can't go out in the market and do that immediately but that would be the expectation that we could -- we'd be able to offset the inflationary pressure with price, and we can drive productivity, operational excellence, and do some things leaner at our facilities. Rich Kwas : So Patrick, would you say that here in the interim that, that's going to be maybe a little bit more of a pressure point until you get deeper into next year, as we think about price cost metrics? Patrick Shannon : Yes, it would be a little pressure point, but given our guidance, the expectation will be some continued margin expansion in Q4. So you're not seeing the full effect of that and we did go off the price increase in October you don't see the full effect of that, because the bids and order activities protected on some of that into next year. So again, there's always some carryover on that and timing relative to the input cost. Rich Kwas : Okay. And just real quick one, Dave on capital deployment, so you continue to look at acquisitions or some higher-profile assets that are apparently on the block, how do you think the -- how are you looking at the toggle in terms of investments and opportunities and size versus scale, et cetera? Dave Petratis : So, all toggles are available. Our cash build gives us optionality here and I'd say we're fully engaged on the acquisition front. We're busy. We're looking at files around the world. I was energized by my recent visit to the Essen Trade Show in Germany, plenty of things for us to consider, and -- but all toggle available. Rich Kwas : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we do ask having consideration of the others that you limit yourself to one question. And our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : Hi, guys. How are you? Patrick Shannon : Good. Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a broader question, not really related to the market, is this better with the echo? No, no, it's not. Just -- have you guys considered some form of quarterly guidance because this is second quarter this year where you disappoint and the stock is not reacting well while the underlying performance of the Company is actually extremely strong. How do you guys think about it and what do you think you're hearing from the shareholders on this subject? Dave Petratis : Our shareholders, they manage for the long term. I think my energies and the team's energies are better positioned on annual goals and driving towards that. I think we at the end of the day, are a $2 billion Company and our energies are better focused on the long-term versus and giving you good focus on what we'll deliver on an annual basis versus dancing on a quarterly basis. Andrew Obin : Appreciate the answer. Just a follow-up question. You highlighted some weakness in U.S. non-res. Can you just -- I don't to harp on it, but can you just highlight what specific markets you are seeing weakness in? Thank you. Dave Petratis : Andrew, its big-box and it's opening price point. I look at the overall P&L management of the res segment and feel good about it. Mid-single-digit growth for the year, an improvement in our profitability, you'll look at us investing back in that overall rest segment to accelerate the electronics over the next 12 months, and that's kind of how the -- it places. We look at -- in terms of new construction and renovation on the residential segment, as being positive going into next year. But we've got to pick our spots. The replacement and renovation market is always been good for Schlage brands and we think we have an opportunity with the strength of our electronic products to create some demand as electronics convergence moves forward. Andrew Obin : Terrific. Thank you so much guys. Dave Petratis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Lee Sandquist : This is Lee Sandquist on for Julian Mitchell. Can you just talk about your updated organic guidance in Asia Pacific and how we should think about the potential margin expansion and organic growth story here over the longer term? Dave Petratis : I think -- I hope you have thought about how our repositioning in the market. We're focused. We're going after specific verticals, executing well in Australia and New Zealand, and I think it's going to give us above-market growth opportunities. Patrick, I'll let you talk about the margins. Patrick Shannon : Yes, margin, as you've seen, has continued to expand some of that, obviously related to that the divested Bocom business last year but organically, getting good top line growth and that's helping to accelerate the margin improvement there. We outlined on the last call, I think, the long-term objective to get to 10%-plus type of OI. I don't think that's in the next 12 months but I would expect to see continued improvement as long as the region continues to show strength and its organic growth opportunities Dave Petratis : We are competing in the segments that we attack on spec-driven type work similar to what we do in Europe and the Americas, and high-valued electronics. A lot of the Asian market is opening price point but there's plenty of us room to operate and I think carve out a pretty good business that's been reflected over this year. Lee Sandquist : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeremie Capron with CLSA. Jeremie Capron : Thanks good morning. Can you guys maybe recap the situation with regards to the Bocom business in China and the charge you're taking this quarter? I know you took a pretty sizable impairment charge last year just before selling the business? And particularly from a cash flow perspective, what do you eventually get for Bocom in terms of, again, in terms of cash? Thank you. Dave Petratis : Yes, so going back strategically, right decision to divest the business. You may recall long earnings cycle, with government municipalities, bad return on invested capital, and so divesting the business, given that we had nothing really to leverage within our portfolio. Good move there. The write-down last year was just based on the anticipated consideration that we were going to receive. And what's happened since the sale, basically, is the business has deteriorated relative to its future ongoing cash requirements, the receivables, coming in lower than anticipated, again, from the government municipalities and so you look at what the expectation is going forward and we determine that the consideration isn't collectible at this moment, will continue to endeavour to do what we can to work with the business, to collect on those monies. But right now, don't anticipate any collections. It has no impact relative to our available cash flow projections. As indicated, we upped our ACF guidance has no impact, really, going forward. It was not included in our guidance to begin with and so it's just -- it's unfortunate but one of those things that's happened given the deterioration in the business in the broader China economies. Jeremie Capron : Thanks. And going back to the electronic lock portfolio and the growth you've seen this year. It seems to be slowing a little bit after a strong success of the Schlage Sense about a year ago. I wonder as we go into 2017, how is your product development pipeline looking? Should we expect re-acceleration of -- in the electronic locks side of your portfolio? Thanks. Dave Petratis : Electronic development of our entire portfolio and this would include exit devices, locks, the smart closers, will continue to be a high priority in our investment, capital deployment decisions. I think any time when you introduce new technologies, when we have the success, the market tends to normalize. And low double-digit growth is significantly above the 8% -- 6% to 8% growth that is forecasted for growth for this globally. So feel good about the opportunity. There is 1 billion locks in the world and the penetration rates globally are low. We think it's one of the bright opportunities for Allegion going forward. Jeremie Capron : Thanks guys and good luck Dave Petratis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Patrick Shannon : Hi, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : I was wondering if you could just provide a little bit more color on [Indiscernible] pick up my handset, too, here. A little bit more color on what you're seeing in the non-res markets, institutional, in particular? I think you mentioned healthcare strength, but if you can go around the verticals and give us a little color, that would be helpful. And also in the past, you've talk a little bit about your front logs and bidding activity. Any update there would also be helpful? Thanks. Dave Petratis : So, not going to give specific numbers on our research but total institutional, as we move into 2017, positive, education, positive, I think, builds on our comments. The state budgets, municipalities budgets are in line. We've been pretty active in K-12 security. Tim Eckersley, our Head of the Americas, was just given a national award on this. We participated in a forum with government officials. There's tightness of funds but K-12 security, infrastructure, we see as a positive as we move into 2017, including higher aid [ph]. Hospitals, our total healthcare, a bit of a mixed bag. We see 2017 as a positive in hospital construction, but I would say modest. What's happening there, more medical office and clinics but that typically comes at a lower price point and lines up nicely with our initiative to go after some of this light commercial. So total institutional, as I look from 2016 to 2017, positive. The commercial, we'd say slightly flat to slightly up, but the Allegion perspective, as we move into 2017 at our core markets in the U.S. is positive, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Would you say there's preponderance towards retrofit activity right now in those markets? Or can you address the mix, new versus retrofit as you see it? Dave Petratis : The retrofit market chugs along. Even when in the bottoms of the recession and budgets are tight, it's the gift that keeps on giving. If you've got a lock, exit device or closer, I think, my view on the retrofit replacement market is, again, net positive. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna International. Robert Barry : Hey, guys. Good morning. Patrick Shannon : Hey, Rob. Robert Barry : Could I just clarify that comment on that Bocom receivable? It sounds like it's not impacting the cash flow outlook but is it a receivable you had expected to collect on and now you're not or could you just clarify that? Patrick Shannon : Yes, exactly. So at the time of disposition, again in Q3 last year, the expectation was there would be some consideration to be received from the collection of receivables on that divested business that would then funnel to us, and now the outlook we're saying it's unlikely that we will have any monies coming our way associated with that. Robert Barry : Got you. So some of the compensation you received effectively was this receivable so the sale proceeds are lower? Patrick Shannon : Correct. Robert Barry : Is that fair? Okay, I guess just a couple of housekeeping items at this point. On the tax rate, should we carry this 18% rate forward into 2017, and if it's 18% for the year, does that imply a particularly low rate in 4Q? And then on the performance comp accounting change, does that add $0.09 next year and $0.12 in future years? Thanks. Patrick Shannon : Yes, so on the taxes, so the 18% full year guidance includes the $0.03 one-time benefit from the accounting change on the stock-based comp, so you'd really have to back that out and you get to a range that's really closer to our original guidance, the top end of 19%, so that would be kind of the going forward position, if you will. And then, as we put together our budget and plans for 2017, we will give you more guidance on that going forward. Robert Barry : I see so it's like a one-timer for now. Patrick Shannon : Exactly. Robert Barry : Right. Okay. Thank you. Patrick Shannon : Yep. Operator : And this morning's last question comes from Brandon Rolle with Longbow Research. Brandon Rolle : Hi this is Brandon Rolle on for David MacGregor. My question was surrounding the America's incremental margins. How much of this do you think is based on temporary weakness and the year-ago compares and how sustainable are these levels? We normally think of your business as having a 40% incremental margin on volume but you have been well above that for the past few quarters. Is that 40% becoming a larger number? Patrick Shannon : Well, I think long term, 40% probably a good expectation is what we would anticipate. You're right. We got really good leverage at our operating facilities on the incremental volume but long-term, 40% probably a good barometer to use. As we mentioned previously, as the business continues to grow, and we can manage the inputs, inflation, productivity, pricing, investment, et cetera, we should continue to get some incremental margin improvement going forward. Operator : All right. And as there are no more questions right now, I would like to return the call to Michael Wagnes for his closing comments Mike Wagnes : We'd like to thank everyone for participating in today's call. Please contact me with any questions and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Wagnes, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Mike Wagnes - Allegion Plc : Thank you, Daniel. Good morning, everyone. Welcome, and thank you for joining us for the Allegion fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings call. With me today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning; and the presentation, which we will refer to in today's call, are available on our website at allegion.com. This will be recorded and archived on our website. Please go to Slide number 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Please go to Slide number 3. Our release and today's commentary include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of restructuring, impairment, acquisition and divestiture expenses and charges in current year and prior-year results. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior-year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details. Dave and Patrick will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results and provide 2017 guidance, which will be followed by a Q&A session. For the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and then re-enter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone given the time allotted. Please go to Slide number 4, and I'll turn the call over to Dave. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Thanks, Mike. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Allegion posted another strong quarter of operational results and closed out a very strong year. The high level of execution and performance is driven by one of the most engaged and safest workforce in the security industry. For the fourth quarter, revenue came in at $569.7 million, growing 5.2% on an organic basis. Total revenue increased 4.4% over prior year, reflecting the impact of divestitures and foreign currency partially offsetting the organic growth. Our strong organic growth was led by the Americas, which grew 7% in the quarter, as both non-residential and residential business expanded nicely. EMEIA organic revenues grew at 1.4%, and our Asia-Pacific business saw organic revenue decline by 0.7%. Adjusted operating income of $102 million decreased 1.4% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin declined by 110 basis points. These declines were driven by a $15 million environmental remediation charge taken in the fourth quarter, which reduced the adjusted operating margin by 260 basis points. The operating performance, excluding the environmental charge, reflect continued price realization and solid leverage on an incremental volume, which more than offset the 70 basis points headwinds from incremental investments. Europe and Asia-Pacific saw significant improvement in adjusted operating margin. The environmental remediation charge did cause the Americas' overall operating margin to decline. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.81 decreased $0.08 or 9% versus the prior year. This includes the environmental remediation charge, which had a $0.10 per share impact. Overall, I am pleased with the strong revenue growth and solid operational performance in the fourth quarter. I'd like to briefly talk about the environmental remediation charge taken in the quarter. At Allegion, we help keep people safe and secure where they live and work, while safeguarding our environment at the same time. In the fourth quarter of 2016, with the collaboration and approval of state regulators, we launched a proactive alternative approach to remediate two sites in the United States. This approach will allow us to be more aggressive in addressing the environmental conditions at these sites and reduce the impact of potential changes in regulatory requirements. As a result, we recorded a $15 million charge from environmental remediation in the fourth quarter. We value the importance of a cleaner world. We are committed to being a responsible member of our global communities, and the actions we are taking at these sites benefit both Allegion and the environment. Please go to Slide 5. Now, I'd like to talk about Allegion's accomplishments in 2016. We continue to have an exceptional occupational safety record and continue to be a safety leader in the industry. We delivered high organic growth, led by our Americas and Asia-Pacific regions. We've executed our channel-led business strategy and continued to focus on innovation, helping to drive organic growth and increase our vitality index. In addition, we've seen continued strong operating leverage and expansion of adjusted operating margins in all of our regions. We delivered a 10.2% increase in full year adjusted earnings per share and had a record year from cash flow, as our available cash flow increased to $335 million, an increase of $112.8 million or 50.8% over last year. Please go to Slide 6. In 2016, our pioneering brand launched a range of new products across the globe in a variety of markets and verticals. On this slide, you can see a sampling of those newest electronic and mechanical innovations. In the Americas, we launched Schlage Control Smart Interconnected Locks for the multi-family market, allowing cloud-based mobile app control for property managers and phone credential capabilities for residents. Late in the year, we introduced the Everest 29 SL cylinder by Schlage, which allows commercial buildings on multiple key systems to be brought into one unified restricted key system without replacing current door hardware. In Europe, the Briton 571 EL is a new commercial exit device that integrates with electronic access control systems, meaning, it offers both panic exit functionality and can be monitored remotely. In fact, it can be paired with the SimonsVoss MobileKey, our new app-based access control solution for medium to large buildings that can control up to 20 doors and assign access to 100 users at a time. In the Asia-Pacific, Milre added five new electronic locks like the MI-480s that draws on the latest residential market design trends to offer homeowners a sleek rim lock with keyless entry via a smartcard or passcode opening. As a result of our focus on innovation and investing in new product development, we have been able to increase our vitality index, which was single digits in 2014 to high teens in 2016 with a goal of approximately 25% in 2018. As a result, this will continue to drive organic growth and help leverage our connected platforms across the region. Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to update you on our full year 2017 guidance. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. Please go to Slide number 7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for both the fourth quarter and the full year. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 5.2% and 5.8% organic growth in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. The strong organic growth reflects improved markets, the introduction of new products and the company's channel initiatives. Pricing was favorable in the quarter in all regions, as the company remains disciplined in taking necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impacts of rising commodity prices. Foreign currency was a headwind in the quarter, particularly in the EMEIA region. During the quarter, divestitures were a slight headwind, which offset the impact of acquisitions. For the year, all three regions were favorable on price and saw headwinds from foreign currencies. Acquisitions more than offset the impact of divestitures. Please go to slide number eight. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $569.7 million. This reflects an increase of 4.4% versus the prior year, up 5.2% on an organic basis. I was particularly pleased with the outstanding organic revenue growth from Americas, which had strong growth in both the non-residential and residential businesses off a tough comparison from the prior year. We continue to make significant progress with our new product introductions and channel strategies. We had improved pricing in the quarter, offsetting the currency headwinds seen in EMEIA. In the fourth quarter, we lapped the large acquisitions completed during 2015. As such, during the quarter, the incremental contribution from acquisitions was offset by the impact of the divestiture of the system integration business in the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating income of $102 million and adjusted operating margin of 17.9% declined 1.4% and 110 basis points, respectively, when compared to the prior year. Included in these numbers is the environmental remediation charge of $15 million, which had a 260 basis point impact on the adjusted operating margin in the quarter. Excluding the environmental charge, the underlying operational improvement was driven by solid incremental volume leverage and continued progress on our EMEIA margin transformation. During the quarter, price and productivity more than offset the impacts of inflation and incremental investments. Our EBITDA margin of 20.5% was a 110 basis point decline versus the prior year but, similar to adjusted operating margin mentioned earlier, includes the 260 basis point impact of the environmental remediation charge. Excluding the charge, all regions improved during the quarter. The business continues to execute at a high level, demonstrating both strong organic growth and operational margin improvement, while continuing to make investments for future profitable growth. Please go to slide number 9. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter 2015, reported EPS was $0.74. Adjusting $0.15 for the prior-year restructuring expenses and integration costs, related acquisitions and divestitures, the 2015 adjusted EPS was $0.89. Operational results increased EPS by $0.16, as favorable price, operating leverage and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. As noted previously, the environmental remediation charge drove a $0.10 reduction. Next, interest and other income were a net $0.07 reduction. This was driven primarily by the positive impact from the sale of non-strategic marketable securities during the fourth quarter of 2015 that did not repeat in Q4 of 2016. The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate drove $0.03 per share reduction versus the prior year. The increase in rate is primarily due to unfavorable changes in the mix of income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions, partially offset by the impact of new accounting standard for stock-based compensation and reductions in certain countries' statutory tax rates. The adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter 2016 was lower than anticipated due to favorable resolutions of uncertain tax positions and changes in certain countries' statutory tax rates. Incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel strategies were a $0.03 reduction. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, subtracted $0.01 in the quarter. This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2016 EPS of $0.81 per share. Continuing on, we have a negative $0.04 per share reduction for acquisition and restructuring charges. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at fourth quarter 2016 reported EPS of $0.77. Please go to slide number 10. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $410 million, up 7% on both a reported and organic basis. Strong organic growth reflects above-market performance, driven by our new products and channel initiatives. As noted on the chart, we experienced solid, high-single digit growth in the non-residential products driven by strength in our premium brands and mid-single digit growth in residential products, with solid performance in both our retail and builder channels. Revenue growth was strong across most product categories with continued momentum in electronics. Americas' adjusted operating income of $96.7 million declined slightly versus the prior-year period as a result of the $15 million environmental remediation charge mentioned earlier. Excluding the charge, operationally, Americas' adjusted operating income increased due to incremental volume leverage, favorable mix and positive impact from foreign currency. Overall, price and productivity offset inflation and incremental investments. Pricing realization improved sequentially in the quarter with good performance in both commercial and residential markets. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 260 basis points, driven by the 370 basis point impact from the environmental charge. The operational increase, while absorbing the incremental investment spend, demonstrates excellent performance by the entire Americas team. Please go to slide number 11. Fourth quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $129.4 million, up 0.2%, or up 1.4% on an organic basis. The reported revenue growth was driven by the impact of the organic growth and acquisitions, partially offset by currency headwinds. In particular, the portable security and SimonsVoss businesses saw solid growth. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $19.9 million increased 13.1% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 180 basis points, reflecting continued improvements in the ongoing business transformation, more than offsetting currency headwinds. Although it isn't reflected on the slide, the full year adjusted operating margin for EMEIA was 9.3%. At the time of the spin-off, adjusted operating margin for this business was approximately 1%. This is a significant improvement in operational results driven by an extremely dedicated EMEIA team. Please go to Slide number 12. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $30.3 million, down 8.5% versus the prior year. Organic revenue declined 0.7% and was impacted by the timing of orders and large non-recurring projects in 2015. Total revenue declines are attributable to the divestiture of the system integration business in 2015. Our Australia and New Zealand markets continued to be strong along with Southeast Asia. Asia-Pacific adjusted operating income of $2.3 million was up 4.5%. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 100 basis points, reflecting favorability in price and productivity along with the impacts of divesting the system integration business. Please go to Slide number 13. Available cash flow for 2016 was $335 million, an increase of $112.8 million or 50.8% compared to the prior-year period. The increase in year-over-year available cash flow is primarily attributable to higher net earnings. Working capital as a percent of revenues and the ratio for the cash conversion cycle increased in 2016. The increase was primarily driven by planned increases in inventory levels in certain areas to improve customer fulfillment requirements. As discussed later in the presentation, we made a $50 million discretionary contribution to our U.S. pension plan in January 2017. This contribution significantly improved the plan's funded status, while also reducing future cash payments to the plan and reducing anticipated increases in pension expense for future years. This outflow is included in the guidance of available cash flow for 2017. Please go to Slide number 14. Since the spin, we stated our capital allocation strategy is one that defines a balanced and flexible approach, which remains a primary focus today. We ended the year with a gross debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.9 times, in the middle of our targeted range of 2.75 times to 3.25 times. If you recall, we ended 2015 with a 3.5 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA. This reduction reflects growth in EBITDA during the year, as well as mandatory principal payments made on our secured credit facility. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ended the year at 2.3 times. As Dave will discuss later in the guidance, we continue to see opportunity to fund incremental investments for channel strategies, new product development and demand creation to accelerate core market expansion. Supported by our 2016 performance, we believe these investments will enable the company to continue to grow at an accelerated pace and faster than the broader market as well as provide superior returns on invested capital. We also remain focused on growing our portfolio through acquisitions. We plan to keep our flexibility and our balance sheet optionality available for potential M&A opportunities. While we did not close as many transactions during 2016 as we did in 2015, the M&A pipeline remains active, as evidenced by the recent announcement of our acquisition of Republic Doors. And lastly, we have the opportunity to provide shareholder distributions through increased dividends that reflects strength and confidence in our cash flow. In addition, we will continue to repurchase shares to offset dilution and to be opportunistic when appropriate. Last week, we announced a 33% increase in our quarterly dividend and also announced a new $500 million share repurchase authorization. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we repurchased 850,000 shares for approximately $55 million under our previous share repurchase authorization. In summary, we have many options to deploy capital for the benefit of our shareholders. This is driven by our ability to generate consistent, high cash flow. I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2017 guidance. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide 15. We expect continued growth in our primary markets in 2017. And it's our expectations that the organic growth investments, combined with our ability to execute, will deliver better than market growth. In addition, we believe the mechanical to electromechanical convergence will help stimulate the growth of our business, as we are well positioned to take advantage of this industry trend. In the Americas, we see positive indicators in key verticals within the non-residential and residential businesses. On the institutional markets, we continue to expect solid growth. Safe school initiatives and the need for school security upgrades is evident when you review state legislative priorities. The outlook for healthcare is also positive, especially in the special care senior living care facilities. We expect growth in the commercial markets, as our channel initiatives gain traction and end markets continue to cooperate. Overall, we anticipate mid-single digit organic growth for the non-residential segment. We expect the U.S. residential markets will increase mid-single digits, driven by both builder and retail segments in 2017. Single-family home construction will continue to be strong, although there will be some variance in this segment driven by labor and land availability. The multi-family segment will continue to remain solid, but we expect a deceleration in the rate of growth as compared to the last few years. Consolidating the market outlooks, we project organic revenue growth in the Americas of 6% to 7% and reported revenue growth of 7% to 8%, reflecting the recent acquisition of Republic Doors. For the EMEIA region, we anticipate flat to low-single digit market growth overall. Confidence in investments throughout Europe are being affected by the uncertainty surrounding the impact of Brexit. As such, we expect the UK construction market to be lower in 2017. We expect continued growth in Germany. For the region, we project organic growth of 1% to 3%. When we combine the impact of currency, we project reported revenue of negative 1% to positive 1% for the year. The Asia-Pacific market continues to show mid-single digit growth in residential and non-residential segments. We expect to drive above-market growth, as we focus our effort on key vertical markets where we are strong. Organic growth in the region is estimated to be 10% to 12%, and total revenue growth is estimated to be 7% to 9%, which reflects currency impact. All in, we are projecting total growth and organic growth both at 5.5% to 6.5%. We anticipate improved price realization across all regions to help mitigate inflationary pressures in 2017. Please go to Slide 16. Our 2017 adjusted earnings per share range is $3.55 to $3.70, an increase of 6.3% to 10.8%. The earnings increase is primarily driven by revenue growth and operational improvements, partially offset by investments in the business, currency headwinds, other income and a higher effective tax rate assumed to be between 19% and 20% for the year. We also have a net $0.02 drag associated with the 2016 impact of the sale of marketable securities, net of the environmental remediation charge mentioned earlier. We are not expected to recur this year. We are forecasting strong organic growth and margin expansion in all reported regions. Incremental investments will be focused on new products and channel development, which we believe enables us to deliver above-market growth. Our guidance assume outstanding diluted shares of approximately 96 million, which reflects the company's goal to at least offset share dilution with repurchases. The guidance does not include any impacts from restructuring and acquisition expenses during the year. As a result, reported EPS is also $3.55 to $3.70. We are also projecting our available cash flow for 2017 to be in the $300 million to $320 million range, inclusive of a $50 million voluntary pension funding that Patrick mentioned earlier. Please go to Slide 17. We are very pleased with our 2016 results that delivered organic revenue growth of 5.8% and increased our operating margin by 40 basis points, net of the 70 basis point impact of the environmental remediation charge taken in the fourth quarter. The growth of both revenue and margin, while making investments in our business, demonstrates our disciplined approach to our business. We are recognizing solid growth from our organic investments and continuing to make progress on our vitality index, while we continue to generate robust cash flows. We've made tremendous progress improving our European profitability from slightly positive three years ago to almost 10% today. It's a truly great accomplishment by the entire team to achieve these results in Europe. As we look to 2017, we look to build on the momentum of our prior results. We look to generate strong organic revenue, drive a solid increase in adjusted earnings per share and look to generate substantial available cash flow even after a discretionary pension funding payment. We have a safe and strong team in place committed to our vision to make the world safer, securing the places where people thrive. Now, Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Good morning, Josh. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Just to maybe follow up on some of your comments you made, Dave, on the pricing environment and how we should think about that kind of 4Q into 2017. Presumably, this higher organic growth than you would typically start the year with includes a good amount of price. Could you maybe remind us, I guess, Patrick, how that looked in the fourth quarter? I know you mentioned on the third quarter call that there would be a bit of a price-cost drag because you couldn't get all the increases out there right away as fast as materials were going up. And how we should think about that in 2017? So, I know a lot of questions there. But basically, kind of, follow the narrative for me on price and costs 4Q into 2017, if you could. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yes. So, as you mentioned, Q4 pricing was favorable. If you kind of look at it, relative to the prior quarter, it sequentially improved. We did go out with a price increase at the beginning of the quarter, and our commercial segment of the business saw really good traction there. I think it demonstrates that we've continued to grow in our discipline and focus in this area. Saw good improvement in the residential business as well, which was really positive. We believe that momentum will continue into 2017. And so, the price-cost equation, as we look into kind of the full year basis of where commodity prices trade today, most of the price should offset the commodity headwind. It is a significant, kind of, change if you look at the cost side of the equation. Commodity prices, like steel for example, is up 40%, 50% over the average rate for 2016. So, we are anticipating more price movement in 2017 to offset the increase in the commodity costs. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: But of that 6% to 7% that you have in Americas' organic, how much of that is price? And if I were to look back in the way you start off most years, how would you have thought about that historically? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : So, in Q4, it was about 150 basis points improvement year-over-year. As we look in kind of the full year, 2016 I think across the globe was about 1% price improvement, which is fairly consistent over the prior couple of years. 2017 will be north of that. You're probably looking at 1% to 1.5% improvement. So, the rest of the organic growth would be volume related and we would characterize that as growing at market plus. We would expect, given our channel initiatives, new product development, the traction we've gained, some of the new initiatives, new products coming out for 2017, that we would grow above market of, say, 1% to 2% is our expectation. And that's why you're seeing a fairly robust anticipation of revenue growth for 2017, as well as strong markets. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Terrific. Thanks for the call. I'll get back in queue. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, guys. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Hey, Andrew. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a question. As I look at the outlook for 2017, I would argue that probably top line is quite a bit stronger than a lot of us have been thinking and probably a lot of outgrowth there. But at the same time, you do have these incremental investments. And the question I have in regards to investments, how should we think about them because they are eating into what should be very strong operating leverage? Is this remediating underinvestment under your prior corporate ownership? Or are we sort of banking outgrowth? I know that it's a fine line between the two, but just if you could expound on that a little bit. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So, Andrew, I would think of it like this. As a market leader, particularly, in the U.S., we see opportunities to segment the market and invest for growth. We've talked about this as part of our channel initiatives that I think has delivered above-market growth today. We continue to see opportunities to segment that market, but it takes people, number one. Number two, we believe very strongly in this electromechanical convergence. Again, it takes investment in product development engineering, which is fueling our vitality index which we think gives good returns. So, we're confident in our ability to execute and deliver on those investments that will give us above-market growth as we go forward. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, we should get \u2013 we should also get continued improved return on invested capital going forward from these initiatives as well, right? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I think that's what we've proven. It's important that we're accountable, and we see that opportunity globally. I think Asia-Pacific would be a good example in our segmentation and adjustments there. More work to do in Europe to fuel that growth. And again, it's people driving specification with great products. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah. I would just add, too, Andrew, if you kind of look at these in terms of capital deployment alternatives, you have to look at it over a longer time horizon. And these, historically, over the last couple of years, have provided an outstanding return on invested capital. And so, we kind of \u2013 we look at the opportunities. As Dave said, we're a learning organization, as we look at opportunities to expand our market segmentation, and areas where we're underserved today just provides really good growth opportunities. And we're going to manage the equation so that the incremental investments, we can make those, still grow the top line and expand our margins in the region where we make the investments. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Terrific. Thank you very much. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of questions here on \u2013 as it relates to M&A so cash balance building, I know you outlined your gross debt to EBITDA and where you are versus targets, but it's been a little while since some deals have been done. Dave, how should we think about what's going on in the market? And is this a valuation issue? It doesn't seem like it's an opportunity issue in terms of number of opportunities. But what's kind of holding back in terms of the execution? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I think we haven't revealed those deals we didn't do, which I think were disciplined capital allocation decisions. The pipeline in my mind is fruitful. We continue to work it extremely hard. We think the industry consolidates. We did just knock off a small deal with Republic Doors, which we think advances the Americas. And this is kind of the nature of M&A. It had ebbs and flows, and we think there's plenty of opportunity as we move through the year. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So, we shouldn't read too much into the higher cash balance in normal, there's nothing pending here that is pretty significant necessarily. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I will just smile and look at our ability to generate the cash that we did in this company in 2016. It's important to us, and we're going to deploy it in a flexible manner. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And just a real quick follow-up just on \u2013 this relates to near-term stuff. So, Patrick, on Q1, last year, the ERP implementation, that hurt sales and you had the rebound in Q2. How should we think about \u2013 I know you don't give quarterly guidance. But how should we think about modeling this on a year-over-year basis and the puts and takes for Q1? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah. From a seasonal perspective, I think you probably have to look at \u2013 go back to 2015 and look at kind of the split there from top line perspective. It may be back into, kind of, the first half of 2016 and assume kind of revenue growth and margin expansion in both quarters year-over-year. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : But you're right, the comparisons were easier in Q1 just because of the blip we had last year. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : On an annualized basis, our team went through a very challenging ERP implementation in Indy Ops and grew that business nicely year-over-year. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right, all right. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Please go ahead. Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Nice job on the growth. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Thank you, Tim. Good to hear from you. Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. I guess, just \u2013 I'll ask a border adjustability question. If you guys could just talk a little bit about how we should think about some of the tax policies that have been put forth out there. And then, just internally what type of exposure you might have to Mexican manufacturing and then how that relates to the industry. And then, any sort of contingencies that you guys might be thinking about? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So, any changes along the border that could affect imports into the countries, I think you got to think about it in multiple dimensions. Number one, our greatest exposure is to our resi business. And as we think about the resi, we're in the boat with all competitors and \u2013 however, that \u2013 tide rises. We think any tariffs would be passed along. Nobody is going to be able to change overnight. So, that's our biggest exposure. On the commercial institutional, you know that, here in the U.S., we've got a very strong U.S.-based manufacturing base that leads to industry profitability. So, we think we navigate through that okay. Third, I think this industry has good pricing disciplines. We do import component parts along with others. Again, we think we could pass that along. So, in a world of uncertainty, we have I think a lot of flexibility. And I'd emphasize, as you have been through our factories, our manufacturing excellence has a lot of ability to flex and move where we needed to be. I think we're probably at a better state of readiness than anybody in the industry to be able to adapt to change. Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Well, good luck on 2017. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey. Guys, good morning. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Good morning. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Can you hear me? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Yeah. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yeah. So, I guess, I just wanted to clarify on whether you expect the Americas' margin to be up in 2017 kind of materially so, especially if you exclude the charge in 2016. It sounds like price, you think, will just kind of offset cost. Investment spending looks like it will be up a fair amount, but you'll have good volume leverage. But the net of all that seems to me, roughly, I don't know, flattish or only modest margin expansion. So, how are you thinking about that? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : So, we'll continue to see margin expansion. The pricing is going to be stronger. As you said, that should offset a lot of the commodity cost increase. We continue to get outstanding volume leverage on the incremental volume. And so, that should continue to move forward. Productivity improvements will continue to drive margin performance as well. So, the margin expectation is, we'll manage the incremental investments to ensure that we get top line growth. So, we're still getting margin accretion in Americas and that should be fairly steady throughout the course of the year. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got you. Just a quick follow-up, a housekeeping item. Did you mention what the electronics growth was in the quarter or could you? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : So, we didn't mention it in the quarter. Well, for the full year, kind of, low-double digits growth. Q4 was kind of similar type of range. It continues to grow faster than the traditional mechanical business. A good trend for us. As you know, electronic products sell at a higher average selling price, similar margin, more EBIT dollars, cash flow. So, good trend, and that's something we're investing in to take advantage of that electromechanical convergence. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from David McGregor from Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Brandon Roll\u00e9 - Longbow Research LLC : Hi. This is Brandon Roll\u00e9 on for David McGregor. I was hoping that you could give some color on the non-residential segment and what you're seeing in specified institutional markets versus commercial distributor businesses and how growth compared for each? And to follow up on that, how do you expect these growth patterns to extend into the first half of 2017? Thank you. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So, we're net positive on what we would describe as total institutional growth as we move into 2017. I think the overall environment that we'll leave in 2016 was positive. I think we called that a year ago. We work hard to understand the drivers. But we would see total education stronger in 2017 than it was in 2016. We'd see healthcare stronger in 2017 than it was in 2016. Some changings in terms of hospitals. The hospital model is changing. We know we don't see as many big institutions, but we see a lot of more walk-in cares, imaging cares that fall right into our wheelhouse. So, we like this institutional space. I think, if you also dive into bond issues that were improved in the fourth quarter of 2016, it was net positive. There's a need for infrastructure, school security. We like our position. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Just a quick one on growth spend, and I apologize if you went through this. I've been bouncing back and forth here a little bit. But obviously, it's paying off with the organic growth. But just give us a sense of really what you're targeting in 2017 and what the trajectory of growth spend might be going forward. Should we expect it to continue to incrementally ratchet up meaningfully, or do we kind of settle down into a pattern where it's kind of growing in line with sales? Thank you. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yes. So, I would anticipate \u2013 well, first of all, the step-up here is all related to specific opportunities that we see specific around the market segmentation that Dave talked about, expansion of the channel, discretionary market opportunity, new product development, those type of things. The other thing that's fueling that a little bit is, when we acquire companies, I mean, there's opportunities that, in order to fully realize that investment and take advantage of that, investments are needed to kind of expand the capabilities of that. Republic Door would be a good example of that, where we need some infrastructure spending, if you will, to fully take advantage of that acquisition and to fill out the regional distribution capabilities for fulfillment for customers. So, really, it's going to be dependent upon what's taking place in the industry, acquisitions, et cetera. But I would say, going forward, long term, $0.15 to $0.20 I would say is probably a peak. How much it will taper down from there is hard to say. But each year, we'll kind of look at it individually. But I think the critical thing is that, when we evaluate these, we ensure that there's good revenue growth opportunity that we can execute on it, the risk of doing that isn't significant and it's \u2013 we got to demonstrate a proof-of-concept in the marketplace before we put a bunch of capital behind it. So, we've got levers we can pull. If we can't execute, we can swaddle back a little bit. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I would just add to that, too, as we moved into 2017, a hard squeeze on what I call back-office costs and any increase in investments in things that we believe that will produce growth for us going forward in the future, including new products. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, guys. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Hey, Joe. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So, I guess, maybe just touch on EMEIA margin. You had really nice progress this past year getting to 9.3% on an adjusted basis. I'm just wondering what's your expectation now for 2017 and beyond for the segment? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So, incremental year-over-year improvement. When you come to Investor Day, we'll give you a better look at that, what we see long term, but continued step-up year-over-year. I think \u2013 as I think about Europe, it's a little bit like three-dimensional chest. We have to continue to improve our geographical position. The northern margins are better than we're \u2013 our traditional markets. Second is investment in growth on our spec writing capabilities is important. I described our core mechanical business as more of a flow goods business that wholesalers are providing. We do the best in the world where we can drive specs. So, I wish I could be more aggressive and say, hey, it's going from this point to this. We've made big moves. But as we look at ourselves versus our competitors with similar geographical regions, we're significantly above them, so we got to be realistic in terms of how it goes forward. Our ultimate goal would be mid-teens. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it, got it. And then \u2013 but I guess, for 2017 specifically, I mean, is the expectation, at least, double digits this year? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Yes. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Good morning. I guess, one area that hasn't really been touched upon today is the Asia-Pac region. You had some timing issues on sales in Q4. You've got very bullish guidance, I guess, on the organic sales line for 2017. So, just trying to understand what your visibility is like on that double-digit growth assumption, how much is in, for example, backlog or large projects that you might be thinking about. And also, when you think about that region more broadly, what the overall ambitions are in terms of, for example, extra capital deployment, given you had been kind of shrinking in that region in the last three or four years. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So, it is true we've repositioned the portfolio, I think, nicely. It's allowed us to focus on our core business. We are applying the segmented market approaches that we are in the U.S. to drive growth, and it's yielding results. We will continue to be opportunistic in terms of M&A in the region, but I'd also say patient with a flavor towards electronics. Our Milre acquisition in South Korea, growing quite nicely and we see the Asia-Pacific region, in terms of the electronic convergence, moving faster. We want to be a part of that. But overall, feel good about our execution, confident in our growth ability, more based on the segments that we're driving. We had some project wins in the fourth quarter. That's a little bit like a license to hunt. We've got to go deliver those, which we're confident we can, and continue positive on the region. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And just on the \u2013 and how about the sort of margin potential there longer term? Do you think you can get towards a European-type margin eventually if that's sort of mid-teens similar aspiration on the margin level? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : That's a good aspiration. We, again, think \u2013 the improvement year-over-year and we will go into more detail at Investor Day on how we see the next three to five years in the region. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah. A little bit more difficult, just given the scale and size of the region. But steady improvement, kind of, like where we are now with Europe. We'd expect to leverage on top line growth and continue to drive price to exceed inflation and just steady improvement. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Perfect. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jeremie Capron from CLSA. Please go ahead. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to, sort of, go back on EMEIA margins. Clearly, some nice improvements in profitability here in the past two years. At 9%, I think you're just 1 point short of the 10% target you presented two years ago. So, when you look back at the progress you made there, what do you think it is that held you back a bit? I know, last year, you had some issues with some of the European acquisitions. So, I wonder if you could comment also how you feel about the performance of these acquisitions in the first year also. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I'd say the first headwind versus the 10% is more the challenge of redeploying our manufacturing capability. We took out over 150 jobs in Italy. We have gone to some partners in some new production sites. There's always challenges with this. And as we've said in past calls, that didn't go off exactly as we would have anticipated, but we're well positioned for 2017. In terms of \u2013 there was a pretty big transformation in the portfolio. We cut parts out. We have added, with SimonsVoss, AXA. In 2016, we established, what we call, global portable security. They're working to forward the strategies on that, which we think will fuel growth and profitability. And so, overall, we're very pleased with the improvement over the last 36 months. We have not been at this level of profitability since 2008. The other opportunity is continuing to build our specifying capability. This comes with people. It can also come with acquisitions. SimonsVoss helps us in the spec writing capability, but you have to coordinate that across the region. This takes more time, but we think our prospects going forward are positive. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. Thanks. And the environmental remediation work that you guys are undertaking right now, you said that's coming ahead of potential regulatory requirement. Obviously, a lot of uncertainty around the regulatory environment going forward. So, I wonder if you foresee any future similar work at other facilities around your global manufacturing footprint. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I don't see any further changing needs in terms of any environmental exposures we have globally. This is another example. Over the last 36 months, we did not inherit from Ingersoll Rand an environmental department. We had to establish that, establish a review of the sites that we operate in the world. And the change or investment that we made was more driven by proven technologies. We felt that we could make that investment and remediate those sites at a faster pace versus what we were conducting. We had to work with state and local officials. And take it as our commitment to do the right thing in the places that we operate. Those will be cleaner sites. And I think we have a very good handle on what we own today. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Saliq Khan with Imperial Capital. Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC : Good morning, guys. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Hey, Saliq. Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC : So, one question on my end, Dave. As you take a look at the facilities that you have globally, there's roughly 30 production facilities that you guys have. I just want to get better clarity on what it is that you're doing now to bring about automation, improve the production process and ultimately reduce the cost profile and bring about speed to market. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So, number one, I would look at our return on invested capital and profitability margins. We're significantly ahead of the competition. Our engineered order nature and the varieties of products that we make don't necessarily leverage huge automation investments. In things like polishing, our finishing facilities, you will see a high level. But if you go down here to India ops or into the facilities at SimonsVoss in East Germany, I think we use a balance of build-to-order human hands and automation to deliver some of the best return on capital. Oftentimes, in manufacturing, it's how we eliminate non-value added work and help our people to improve quality customer satisfaction that yields our margins versus straight automation investment. It's not what I believe get us to the promised ground in terms of effective manufacturing. Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks, guys, and thanks for fitting me in. Firstly, I mean, speaking of deals you didn't do, does dormakaba's purchase of Stanley change the competitive \u2013 or let me put it this way, how does it change the competitive dynamics in the market? Did you see it as rates of investment increase? To what extent do you feel like there is a broader strategic implication here? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So, we certainly followed the Stanley movement almost from the day I arrived at the door. I think we understood our opportunity there clearly. I was not surprised at all with where that asset held up. I think you got to step back and look at it. The performance of the Stanley Mechanical Access had not grown over time, number one. Number two, kaba dorma (01:00:10) also made another move and that was called Mesker Door. And I think they are working to try and position to look more like ourselves in ASA in the North American market. I can only say bringing together companies is never easy and being able to put together the capability of distribution, specification resources are around that. Those new acquisitions and portfolio I think open up opportunities for us to grow. Change is never easy. That's my point there. And that's why we continue to segment the market and invest in the U.S. to drive our organic growth. So, I was not surprised by how those things came out and have no remorse. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And just \u2013 you said before that electromechanical, I guess, growth was around low-double digits range this quarter. I'd just like you to, if you could, dig a little there because I know we've seen over time, as it's grown, it's gone from 20s and 30%-type growth in 2015 to now what was low-teens, mid-teens and now it seems like low-double digits, maybe lower than that in the fourth quarter. What do you see as kind of the forward growth rate here given that we still appear to be at low levels of saturation in North America? What's the opportunity? And are you seeing some kind of slow down, or is it just a function of scale? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : No slowdown. I think we look at this market and think 5% to 8% annual market growth. We're doing better than that. And I think the challenge is for the industry and for Allegion to accelerate the adoption. These are clearly devices that can improve home, commercial institutional security. As we connect these with mobile devices; people want to be confident in them. And in my mind, this market will continue to progress, and Allegion should be \u2013 outgrow the market in that convergence. Operator : Thank you. That was the last question, and this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mike Wagnes for any closing remarks. Mike Wagnes - Allegion Plc : We'd like to thank everyone for participating in today's call. And please, call me with any further questions. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining in on the presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Wagnes. Please go ahead. Michael Wagnes : Thank you, Amy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for Allegion's first quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we'll refer to in today's call, are available on our website at allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website. Please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Please go to Slide 3. Our release and today's commentary include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of restructuring, acquisition expenses and charges in current year and prior year results. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results in comparing to the prior-year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details. Dave and Patrick will discuss our first quarter 2017 results, which will be followed by a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Please go to Slide 4, and I'll turn the call over to Dave. David Petratis : Thanks, Mike. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Allegion posted another strong quarter of operational results, delivering above-market organic growth and substantial margin expansion. We delivered organic growth and adjusted margin expansion across all regions. For the first quarter, revenue was $548.8 million, an increase of 9.3%, reflecting organic growth of 8% as well as the benefit of acquisitions, partially offset by foreign currency. Our strong organic growth was led by the Americas, which grew 10.3% in the quarter, as both nonresidential and residential businesses expanded nicely, supported by favorable end markets and continued returns on our strategic investment. The nonresidential business growth was also aided by delayed shipments in the prior year related to an ERP implementation. EMEIA organic revenues grew at 1.3%, and our Asia Pacific business saw organic revenue growth of 4.8%. Adjusted operating income of $100.7 million increased 19% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margins increased by 150 basis points, as we continue to demonstrate margin expansion from incremental volume in excess of investment headwinds. As stated earlier, all regions showed improvement in adjusted operating margin. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.73 increased $0.12 or 19.7% versus the prior year. Overall, I'm very pleased with the strong revenue growth and operational performance in the first quarter. In addition, we are raising our full year EPS guidance. Adjusted EPS guidance is now $3.60 to $3.75, and reported EPS guidance is $3.57 to $3.72. Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2017 guidance. Patrick Shannon : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. If you would, please go to Slide 5. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the first quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 8% organic growth in the first quarter. The strong organic growth reflects healthy markets in the Americas, continued strength in driving electronics growth and the company's focus on channel initiatives. The favorable comparable, driven by last year's ERP implementation, was also a factor in the strong growth. Pricing was favorable in the quarter in all regions, as the company remains disciplined in taking necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of rising commodity prices. During the quarter, acquisitions contributed 2% growth, and foreign currency was a headwind, particularly in the EMEIA region. Please go to Slide 6. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $548.8 million. This reflects an increase of 9.3% versus the prior year, up 8% on an organic basis. I was particularly pleased with the outstanding organic revenue growth from Americas, which adds strong growth in both the nonresidential and residential businesses, as we continue to deliver above-market growth. We also had good price realization in the quarter, offsetting the currency headwind seen in EMEIA. Adjusted operating income of $100.7 million and adjusted operating margin of 18.3% increased 19% and 150 basis points, respectively, when compared to the prior year. All regions delivered improved adjusted operating margins. The operational improvement was driven by solid incremental volume leverage, price, productivity and product mix, which more than offset the impacts of inflation and incremental investments. I'd also note that we improved our industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin to 21.1% in the quarter, an improvement of 130 basis points versus the prior year. All regions improved on this metric in the quarter. The business continues to execute at a high level, demonstrating both strong organic growth and operational margin improvement, while continuing to make investments for future profitable growth. Please go to Slide 7. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter of 2016, reported EPS was $0.60. Adjusting $0.01 for the prior year restructuring expenses and integration costs related to acquisitions, the 2016 adjusted EPS was $0.61. Operational results increased EPS by $0.17, as favorable price, operating leverage and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. A decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate drove a $0.05 per share increase versus the prior year. The decrease in rate is primarily due to favorable impacts from discrete tax items, including the benefits from the recently adopted accounting standard on share-based compensation. These discrete benefits more than offset unfavorable changes in the mix of income earned in higher rate jurisdictions. Next, a reduction in the number of outstanding shares drove a $0.01 per share increase. Moving on, incremental investments were a $0.04 per share reduction. These investments relate to new product development and channel initiatives, which allow us to grow faster than the market, expand our electromechanical presence and increase our vitality index. Next, interest and other income were a net $0.07 per share reduction. This was primarily attributable to the positive impact from the sale of nonstrategic marketable securities during the first quarter 2016 that did not repeat in Q1 2017. This results in adjusted first quarter 2017 EPS of $0.73 per share, an increase of $0.12 or approximately 20% compared to the prior year, with the growth driven by operational improvements and organic growth. Continuing on, we have a negative $0.02 per share reduction from acquisition and restructuring charges. After giving effect to these onetime items, we arrived at the first quarter 2017 reported EPS of $0.71. Please go to Slide 8. First quarter revenues for the Americas region were $407.6 million, up 12.3% on a reported basis and 10.3% organically. Strong organic growth reflects above-market performance, driven by our new product and channel initiatives, as evidenced by mid-teens growth in electromechanical products. As noted on the chart, we experienced double-digit growth in nonresidential products, driven by strength across the portfolio, as we continue to see solid performance from our organic investments. Delays in shipments in the prior year related to an ERP implementation also contributed to the increase. Residential revenue also grew mid-single digits, with continued strength in electronics. Americas' adjusted operating income of $107.8 million increased 17.7% versus the prior year, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 120 basis points. The increase of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin was driven by incremental volume leverage, price and productivity, offsetting the impact from rising inflation and incremental investments. The operational increase, while absorbing incremental investment spend, demonstrate excellent performance by the entire Americas team. Please go to Slide 9. First quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $118.4 million, down 0.1% and up 1.3% on an organic basis. The reported revenue decline was driven by currency headwinds, which offset the contributions from price realization and acquisitions. The SimonsVoss business continues to perform well and saw strong growth, especially in the dock region. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $8.5 million increased 2.4% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 20 basis points, while price and productivity more than offset the impacts from inflation, investment and currency headwinds. We continue to see margin expansion despite the inefficiencies we experienced associated with the previously announced restructuring plan to optimize our manufacturing footprint in the region. The complexity of the move is challenging. As a result, the benefits we expected to realize are delayed. Please go to Slide 10. First quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $22.8 million, up 9.6% versus the prior year. Organic revenue increased 4.8%, driven primarily by solid growth in the Australia and New Zealand region, as we are seeing good traction on our channel expansion initiatives. Total revenue was also supported by favorable foreign currency impacts and contributions from acquisitions. Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $0.6 million, with adjusted operating margins up 260 basis points versus the prior-year period. Strong volume leverage and improved operational performance led to the adjusted operating margin expansion. Please go to Slide 11. Available cash flow for the first quarter was negative $48.7 million, which is a decrease of $40.5 million compared to the prior-year period. The decrease is driven by the $50 million discretionary pension funding payment that was made in the quarter, partially offset by higher net earnings. Working capital, as a percent of revenues and the ratio for the cash conversion cycle, increased in the first quarter 2017 when compared to the prior-year period. The increase is primarily driven by planned increases in inventory levels in certain areas to improve customer fulfillment requirements and the inventory build related to the EMEIA manufacturing move. We remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital. Lastly, we are affirming our full year available cash flow guidance of $300 million to $320 million, which is net of the $50 million discretionary pension funding payment. I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2017 guidance. David Petratis : Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide 12. As noted on the slide, we are affirming our 2017 guidance for revenue and increasing our earnings per share guidance. We are holding the revenue guidance growth at 5.5% to 6.5%, both on a reported and organic basis. Our view of end markets remains favorable. We continue to see positive indicators in institutional and commercial verticals. In addition, we expect solid residential markets as the momentum in single-family construction continue. We believe that our organic investments, combined with our ability to execute, will continue to deliver better than market growth. We are raising our adjusted earnings per share to a range of $3.60 to $3.75, an increase of $0.05 on both the low end and the high end. This represents adjusted EPS growth of 7.8% to 12.3%. The $0.05 increase is related to nonoperational items. The guidance includes a reduction of reported EPS related to restructuring and acquisition expenses in the amount of $0.03. This brings our updated guidance for reported EPS to a range of $3.57 to $3.72. Included in the revised guidance is an assumption for the full year tax rate to be between 18.5% and 19.5%. The guidance continues to assume outstanding diluted shares of approximately 96 million. Please go to Slide 13. Let me finish by reiterating that I'm very pleased with our first quarter execution and results. As a summary, total revenue growth of over 9%, organic revenue grew at 8%, adjusted operating margins increased 150 basis points, adjusted EPS by nearly 20% growth in the quarter. These are strong results and position us well for the full year. We are affirming our guidance for revenue growth and available cash flow, and we're raising our EPS outlook. Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rich Kwas at Wells Fargo Securities. Rich Kwas : Hi, good morning everyone. Just on the investments for the quarter, was that more weighted to the Americas versus other parts of the world? Patrick Shannon : Yes. It's heavily weighted towards Americas. That trend will continue. As we kind of indicated last time, it's probably 80 :20, Americas versus rest of the world. Similar ratio for Q1, and we'd expect that to continue throughout the balance of the year. Rich Kwas : Okay. And then just on near-term as it relates to - as we think about seasonality with Q2 and whatnot, you have a tougher comp in the Americas given you recaptured the sale of the last year second quarter from ERP. Patrick, any thoughts there? Any additional color we should think about and put under consideration as we look at the balance of the year? Patrick Shannon : I would - we had a strong quarter. As we indicated, some of that strength, just driven primarily from the - not only growth and the initiatives and the returns on investments we're making, but some of it because the easier comparison because the delayed shipments last year, as you're aware of. Tougher comps in Q2, but markets remain fairly strong and tracking towards the organic revenue growth we had indicated at the beginning of the year, 6% to 7% for the full year. Probably a little bit because of tough comps in Q2, I would anticipate a lower revenue growth. But the outlook for the full year still remains fairly positive, just given the activity in the marketplace, response from our customers, order intake, et cetera. Rich Kwas : Okay. And then last quick one. Dave, just on M&A, so you did a small doors acquisition earlier in the year. As you think about the business portfolio, what are the sorts of assets that you're seeing out there that are attractive? And how would you characterize multiples? And how motivated are you to add more door assets to the portfolio? David Petratis : So first of all, I'd say, overall, the pace here is active. Second, we continue to favor the electronics space. We continue to be - work to understand to how we can strengthen our door offerings. Clearly, the Republic move helps us from a regional basis. We think that's important, and we'll continue to try and strengthen that out across North America. But that was the value of Republic, is getting closer to our customers. If you remember, our field crap business heavily centered around Cincinnati, with a couple of mud centers. The door business requires closeness to customers, and that acquisition really helped us to buy operational assets that helps us grow faster. Operator : The next question is from David MacGregor at Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Yes, good morning. Congratulations on a good quarter in the Americas, but I wanted to just maybe dig in a little bit on the European business. And David, can you just kind of unpack that relatively flat growth in Europe and just talk about the puts and takes that you saw in the quarter? And then as well, I guess, while we're in Europe, just do you expect the timing of the benefits from the Italian restructuring if they're running behind? What's - can you give us an update in terms of how you think about the timing of those benefits flowing through? David Petratis : Sure, David. First, when I think about overall Europe, extremely pleased with our long-term progression. We've come a long way since 40 months. Extremely pleased with the growth of SimonsVoss. It was an acquisition in electronics that we targeted, and the performance of that business is strong. Third, some of the moves we made in terms of the restructuring, especially around our CISA business, are very complex. I'm talking running SKUs of over 600 and the total base of over 3,000 SKUs. That change improved our overall profitability, but put some complexity into the supply chain, and we'll work through that for the balance of the year. I'd emphasize, with that move, we will have some money - we built some backlog that we'll work through as we go through the balance of the year, but overall feel good. The complexity or challenge is optimizing that supply chain. And with that number of SKUs, it doesn't come overnight. David MacGregor : So how should we think about EMEIA growth in the second half of the year? David Petratis : I would, in line with our projections, low single digits, with any momentum coming out of the SimonsVoss and the adoption of electronics, and then improving our operational capabilities. Operator : The next question is from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Thanks, good morning guys. So my first question, maybe touch a little bit on the raw mat headwinds that you saw this quarter. It seems like it was a pretty big headwind across the board, and you're able to offset that with price, but I'm curious to hear how you think that progresses through the year. Patrick Shannon : So you're right. We've seen a significant movement in commodities across the board. The biggest impact for us relates to steel, brass and zinc. Steel, year-over-year, is up, at least at the end of the quarter, over 40%. And it's moved since then, another like 20%, so significant movements. And as you indicated, we've been able to move faster in price to offset the commodity headwinds. What I would see through the balance of the year, just kind of given where the current commodity prices trade today, is continued pressure on the cost side. It will escalate a little bit in Q2, Q3 because if you recall, we hedged some of our exposure on a forward-looking basis. And so we're protected. And to the extent the commodity prices stay in place for an extended period of time, the exposure becomes greater. So continued pressure, Q2, Q3. The comps get a little bit easier in Q4 because that's when we start seeing big movements in the cost base. But we will endeavor to mitigate that, offset it, et cetera. And that's our current plan through pricing actions. Joseph Ritchie : Got it. That's helpful, Patrick. And just maybe that - is the base case there that price cost stays positive as we progress through the year? Or is it possible that in the next quarter or so, you could go negative there, and then you'd make it up in the back half of the year? Patrick Shannon : It could be a little negative, but I would think we'd be neutral to slightly up is the expectation, certainly as we look on a full year basis. Joseph Ritchie : Got it. That's helpful. And maybe if I could sneak in one more. When I went and visited you guys, spent time with you guidance at ISE West, it seems like you guys were really excited about the - your ENGAGE platform. I'm just wondering, like how much opportunity is there with the platform? How much is that adding to your share gains in recent quarters? Just maybe expand more strategically, that would be helpful. David Petratis : So when we think about ENGAGE, and as we communicate, think about our overall electronic growth, which is low double digits, it's clearly a differentiator in the market. We think there's opportunities in the commercial, institutional and multifamily space, where we can differentiate our mechanical capabilities with electronics, with ENGAGE. And what we're selling there is convenience, ease-of-use and centralized control over the locking systems, and we think that's an opportunity that we talked about at Investor Day that we'll roll for the next decade. Operator : The next question is from Tim Wojs at Baird. Tim Wojs : Good morning. I guess, my question, Dave, just if you could look at non-res and maybe talk about what you're seeing in maybe some of the larger verticals? We've been hearing that institutional is starting to really gain some steam. So I'm curious if you're seeing that. And then just how we should think about the impact of institutional on mix and margins through the year? David Petratis : I feel good about the institutional demand, the healthcare demand. Our spec writing capabilities or our spec writing abilities are robust. That's how I describe it. You can see some variation across different geographical regions in North America, but it's strong. And it's a bellwether, I think, as we talked about it at Investor Day, as we look at over the next '17 and '18, maybe even a little steam picking up in education. Healthcare, we think '17 will be a good year, and then some softening as we move into '18. And commercial office, because of high occupancy rates, have continued to roll. So we continue to stay positive. Concerns? Ability of labor to put equipment in place, architectural firms to be able to work through the design phase. And that's been a concern all along, professional and construction laborer to be able to put in place, I think, will continue to be a cap or a drag on growth, which puts more importance on our self-help initiatives to be able to grow. Tim Wojs : And is there any way to think about institutional versus commercial mix and the value of a door opening in one vertical versus another? David Petratis : The institutional mix has a higher concentration of SKUs and higher value for us. So if, internally, you prioritize one opportunity or the other, we're always going to go stronger on the institutional side. Operator : The next question is from Jeffrey Kessler at Imperial Capital. Jeffrey Kessler : Thank you. You talked about resi being mid-single digits, which has declined slowly and stabilized over the last couple of years, but the overall Americas being, obviously, growing faster than that. Can you talk about, and particularly as we saw at ISE West, both the mortise and the cylindrical, and the - what we call the ENGAGE platform, what type of growth you're getting in that mid-market area that is transforming from mechanical to electromechanical? Because clearly, if resi is not growing at 15% anymore, something else is growing at 15%. David Petratis : And that growth is leveraged by our position in electronics. Really pleased with the residential electronic growth. We think our ENGAGE platform and our investments we're making to go after multifamily strengthens our offering, where we have some deterioration in terms of res performances in the opening price point segments of the market. And it's not that we couldn't get more aggressive there. We think there's better places. So you balance that out. Mid-single-digit growth for resi is levered for faster growth from electronics, and we're just not aggressive on the opening price point. I think that will continue to be - the opening price point will be a challenge. As you look at the need for new home constructions, there's some big gaps in the opening price points of the market. Jeffrey Kessler : This begs the question of what type of growth you're getting in the mid to- small and mid-commercial market as well as the multifamily and institutional - smaller institutional market, I should say, when it comes to the ENGAGE platform. That must be growing faster than mid-single digits. It's probably, if you balance that out, it's clearly up there in the teens. David Petratis : I would characterize it as this, Jeff. Our single offering, Schlage locks, through e-commerce and wholesale, are what leads the sales growth today. But our best opportunity are in these connective systems, and that's what we're going after in multifamily. Underserved by Allegion - that segment of the market has been underserved by Allegion historically. Jeffrey Kessler : Can those - and just finally, a quick follow-up on broadening that particular set of technology out there, to what extent is that applicable to the institutional - the larger markets that are out there, including institutional health care, doctors' offices, accountants, things like that? David Petratis : I want to make sure I understand your question. As our electronics evolved - our ability to be able to better serve that? I think when you think about college campuses, we look at as a growth driver, think about residential dormitories, we've got cited examples where we've been successful. That's going to continue to grow. I think as we try to go into what we call project-based business, and more effectively compete with a total Allegion package, we think that's opportunistic. And then as we get into the commercial buildings, our NDE, with the cylindrical and mortise capability, gives us the ability to offer a total package solutions on the interior doors. This is what we would say is the mother lode of opportunity in our core markets. Jeffrey Kessler : Okay. Because that's what we got really excited about at ISE West, the ability to start putting those NDE products on the insides of these places. David Petratis : It's clear opportunity for us. I think we're well-positioned. Remember, when we first came out with the NDE, we were first out there, but we needed that mortise. And it tightens up that offering pretty nicely to go after these interior doors and, again, offer a very elegant solution to a building operator that he can get away from keys. Operator : The next question is from Rizk Maidi at Berenberg. Rizk Maidi : Yes, good morning guys. My question is on pricing really. So pricing was up plus 1.1% in Q1, and your largest competitor in Europe improved pricing by 2% in the quarter. How should we think about this? Are you pushing for more volume in the quarter? And also, how should we think about pricing for the rest of the year, given that there are 2 other big players trying to be aggressive in the U.S. as well? Patrick Shannon : So I would characterize it as every year, we - particularly in Americas, we go out to price increase in Q4. And so we start realizing the benefits basically beginning of the following year, as a lot of the activity is price-protected, if you will. So what you saw in Q1 was in line with our expectations in the market. We are not - I'd say we're competitive in the market. We're not being overly aggressive from a discounting perspective, either on residential or nonresidential products. I would anticipate the pricing improvement to continue throughout the course of the year, maybe get a little bit better than the 1-point improvement that we saw in Q1. And that kind of continued throughout the course of the year. David Petratis : I would also add, our European competitor has a larger exposure to steel with their larger steel door business. So they've got to pull that lever just to stay even with the escalation of steel prices. Rizk Maidi : I see. And then just quickly, secondly, on the EMEIA division. So a 0.1% volume growth in the quarter, and I think you benefited from 2 extra working days there. Is there something that we should be aware of there in terms of issues beyond the supply chain issue in Italy? David Petratis : Just building on my comments, we've made big gains in terms of our overall profitability. Part of that came from a repositioning of the supply chain that we're still working. We were really encouraged by the growth in SimonsVoss. As we move our exposure to the DACH influence markets, those are better growth markets than our traditional Mediterranean exposure. So overall, we were pleased with the quarter, especially in terms of the year-over-year improvement, and know that we have work to do in terms of shoring up that supply chain. And you'll see that come throughout the year. Operator : The next question is from Robert Barry at Susquehanna. Robert Barry : Good morning. I don't want to harp too much on the pricing, but just a follow-up. I think the pricing is still better in non-res versus in resi, right, the sort of big-box? Patrick Shannon : They were actually fairly equal in Q1. But normally, you're right. I mean, we get - we have the ability to push price a little bit stronger in non-res than res. Robert Barry : Got you, okay. I mean, I was going to ask, given the context of non-res being so strong, but it sounds like it wasn't really that big a deal. Just a housekeeping item on the cadence of the investment spend. I think you were expecting it to be higher in 2Q and 3Q in the Americas. Is that still the case? Patrick Shannon : That is still the case. As we continue to invest in both our channels and new products, there's, obviously, carryover from the prior year. But funding the new initiatives starts to really ramp up more so in Q2, Q3. So you see a little bit heavier investment in those quarters relative to Q1. David Petratis : I would add. I continue to like our opportunities to grow organically through these investments. I believe, every quarter, we build our credibility in terms of making bets and getting returns on those bets. And we're still opportunistic in terms of our view that we can make those investments and grow the top line and get great leverage. Robert Barry : Yes, make sense. David, maybe just one big picture question. I mean, it seems like things are firing on all cylinders. If you were to - but you also have a pretty healthy growth expectation kind of baked in. At this point, where would you say there's potential upside to your outlook this year, and just to keep a balance to where do you think the downside risk is at this point? David Petratis : So I think upside, number one, would come through share gains through our initiatives. I believe pretty strongly that the overall market is capped by labor install, design capabilities. So our ability to execute, which I've got a pretty high level of confidence on. Second, some of the questions Jeff touched on, the electronics growth look at us to get even more aggressive in promotion of our ENGAGE capabilities. Multifamily, we think these are opportunistic. On the downside, you've just got lots of potential shocks out there that can dampen consumer demand and confidence, and that's on a global basis. So you've got to have - I think you've got to be aggressive in terms of opportunities we see, and then be ready to act. And from my perspective, that's part of being in the construction service industries. Things can change quickly. I think we're - we review with a discipline to make sure that, where we can - where things are going right, we can go faster. And if they're not, we adjust the change. Operator : The next question is from Julian Mitchell at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Just, I guess, my questions would be, just within the Americas market, specifically, if you'd seen any change in the pace of ordering or pipeline activity regarding customer spending over the past 6 months. Or it's been fairly steady? And then secondly, whether the delays - some of those delays in the European restructuring have affected your near-term views on the desirability of doing acquisitions in the EMEIA region over next sort of six months or so. David Petratis : First, in the Americas, it begins with our quotation and specification capabilities, the pulse of that, feel very positive about that. The tone and tenor of the market is as solid as I've seen since 2006 and '07. We want to reemphasize that. I mean, we've come through some pretty dark days since the collapse, and the tone and tenor of the market is as robust as I've seen since the collapse. We still are not at peaks. In education, we would say 88% to peak. Healthcare's at 85%. Commercial office is robust. We'd put that at 99%. But you look at that in context, we think great opportunity for us to go out, take the investments, the new products and go out and grow in the marketplace. So feel good about things. these types of businesses can ebbs and flows. And I think, again, it's the ability of the labor to put it in place. The European question, I continue to be positive on overall Europe in terms of our position, electronics accelerating and us continuing. A huge amount of change has gone - taken place in Allegion Europe, and we will continue to be opportunistic in terms of looking at that through acquisitions. Again, these are more the string of pearls, small acquisitions. As we think about Europe, we think about it in 3 dimensions. How can we improve our technology? How can we move north and improve our northern exposure, which are typically healthier markets? And how can we improve our spec writing and channels to market? So you have to take a long-term view there. We continue to build relationships in terms of that acquisition pipeline, but feel good about the positioning. At $0.5 billion of revenue, we've got a lot of room to grow in Europe. Operator : We have another question from Jeffrey Kessler at Imperial Capital. Jeffrey Kessler : Thank you. When most people think of Europe, they're thinking of obviously 2 of your largest competitors over there. I actually tend to think of Spain as your competitor there. And I'm wondering if you believe, at this point in time, technologically, you have the capability to go head-to-head with your Spanish competitor there, who's obviously, from an aid point of view, is probably too expensive for anybody to take on right now? But from a competitive point of view, this is kind of where you have to break through with SimonsVoss? David Petratis : So we admire our Spanish competitors. They've got a good business. Their positioning is different than ours. We're much more successful in the educational, institutional, healthcare. They're much more active, light commercial, hotels. And so, in the morning, at Allegion, we have to wake up and understand who we are and go after those markets. With that said, as we invest in new products, we go after some of those segments thereafter and continue to leverage our growth outside of these dock areas. That's our best opportunity to grow, but that's how I describe it, Jeff. Jeffrey Kessler : Okay. So the amount of cash you intend to develop, is there tweaking to your cash conversion ratios that you're making throughout the year, depending on business conditions, and what you feel you're going to need to invest in? I mean, do you have a - has the plan changed? Is the plan changing now from what you talked about perhaps 6 or 7 months ago with regard to how much cash you wanted to come down to the bottom line? Patrick Shannon : So no change in the outlook in terms of our available cash flow for the full year. The long-term target is to continue to drive cash flow to be at 100% plus of net earnings. Feel good that that's sustainable, given the low investment requirements, particularly in working capital and CapEx. So we'll continue to drive that. And the deployment of the capital, as we indicated in Investor Day, is we've got certain things that are designated, whether it be CapEx, dividends, debt repayment, et cetera, but we've got a big bulk of capital available for strategic investments, either through M&A or opportunistic share repurchase. And we'll continue to look at those opportunities as we progress throughout the year, but no change relative to our short-term or long-term guidance in terms of cash generation going forward. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mike Wagnes for any closing remarks. Michael Wagnes : Thank you. We'd like to thank everyone for participating in today's call. Please contact me with any questions, and have a great day. Operator : The conference has now concluded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Wagnes, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Wagnes - Allegion Plc : Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for Allegion's Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. With me today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release, which we issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we'll refer to in today's call, are available on our website at allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website. Please go to slide number 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Please go to slide number 3. Our release and today's commentary include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of restructuring and acquisition expenses and charges in current year and prior year results. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results in comparing to the prior-year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details. Dave and Patrick will discuss our second quarter 2017 results, which will be followed by a Q&A session. For the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and then re-enter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone given the time allotted. Please go to slide 4, and I'll turn the call over to Dave. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Thanks, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Allegion posted another strong quarter of operational results, delivering above-market organic growth and continued margin expansion. We delivered solid organic growth across all regions. For the quarter, revenue was $627 million, an increase of 7.2%, reflecting organic growth of 6.2% as well as the benefit of acquisitions, partially offset by foreign currency. All regions contributed to our solid organic growth. The Americas saw organic growth of 6.1% in the quarter, supported by low-double-digit growth in the residential businesses and mid-single-digit growth in our non-residential businesses despite a tough comparable from the prior year. The Americas business continues to see solid returns on our strategic product and channel investments and continues to see favorable trends in end markets. EMEIA organic revenues grew at 6.3%, its best organic quarter of growth since the spin, led by strong growth in our portable security business. Our Asia Pacific business saw organic revenue growth of 7.8%, led by strong growth in electronic locks. Adjusted operating income of $136 million increased 8.2% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin increased by 20 basis points, as we continue to demonstrate margin expansion from incremental volume in excess of investment headwinds. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.11 increased $0.12 or 12.1% versus the prior year. Overall, I'm pleased with the solid revenue growth and operational performance in the second quarter. In addition, we are raising our full-year adjusted EPS guidance. Adjusted EPS guidance is now $3.65 to $3.80 and reported EPS guidance is $3.55 to $3.72. Please go to slide 5. Before I turn the call over to Patrick, I want to take a little time to talk about our organic investments. Since the spin, we've been focused on organic investments to drive above-market growth and these investments continue to pay dividends in the market, while also increasing earnings and providing a superior return on invested capital. The Americas region continues to benefit from our focused investments in channel segmentation and product innovation. Our teams are creating new value in the discretionary commercial market, where channel partners make decisions every day on which brands to provide to end users. They've also worked to accelerate electronic partnerships, strengthen lead management and expand in vertical focused aftermarket programs, all initiatives that are supporting our growth. In addition, Allegion continues to drive growth and create shareholder value by investing in new technologies. Allegion culture of innovation and our global footprint positions us to not only lead the electromechanical convergence that accelerated. Doing so allows us to bring better solutions to our customers, increase our vitality index and drive growth at Allegion. We've also formed and maintained strategic relationships to increase the impact of new product development and ultimately drive more growth. Our open architectural approach to design stimulates the development of other devices for us to connect to, while it also allows the integrators and other trusted third-parties to easily connect to our products into their systems. From day one, Allegion has been committed to making connected products that are the easiest to integrate and secure the places, people and property where we work and live. In residential applications, we now integrate with leading systems like Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa and Samsung SmartThings among others. And we offer solutions for the evolving monitored security market as well. We strive to provide the best platforms to work with for the consumer and ecosystem partners and while leveraging our unique leadership position in the residential multi-family and commercial markets to identify and redeploy disruptive innovations and solutions quickly to enhance our offerings. Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I'll be back to discuss our full-year 2017 guidance. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Thanks, Dave. And good morning everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. Please go to slide number 6. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the second quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 6.2% organic growth in the second quarter. The strong organic growth reflects favorable markets in the Americas along with strong performance in the EMEIA and Asia Pacific regions. Pricing was solid this quarter and was favorable in all regions, as the company remains disciplined in taking necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of rising commodity prices. During the quarter, acquisitions contributed nearly 2% growth and foreign currency was a headwind particularly in the EMEIA region. Please go to slide number 7. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $627 million. This reflects an increase of 7.2% versus the prior year, up 6.2% on an organic basis. I was particularly pleased with the strong mid-single-digit organic revenue growth from all regions. The organic growth was driven by strong volume. We also had good price realization in the quarter, offsetting the currency headwinds seen in the EMEIA region. Adjusted operating income of $136 million and adjusted operating margin of 21.7% increased 8.2% and 20 basis points, respectively, when compared to the prior year. The operational improvement was driven by solid incremental volume leverage and productivity, which more than offset the impacts of product and geographic mix, incremental investments and headwinds from FX. As stated earlier, pricing during the quarter was solid and allowed us to absorb and manage through the higher inflation we experienced. The business continues to execute at a high level demonstrating both strong organic growth and operational margin improvement while continuing to make investments for future profitable growth. Please go to slide number 8. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter of 2016, reported EPS was $0.98. Adjusting $0.01 for the prior-year restructuring expenses and integration costs related to acquisitions, the 2016 adjusted EPS was $0.99. Operational results increased EPS by $0.13, as favorable price, operating leverage and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. A decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate drove a $0.07 per share increase versus the prior year. The decrease in rate is primarily due to favorable impacts from discrete tax items including a $0.09 per share benefit from the release of a valuation allowance. These discrete benefits more than offset unfavorable changes in the mix of income earned in higher tax rate jurisdictions. A reduction in the number of outstanding shares drove a $0.01 per share increase. Interest and other income were a net $0.04 per share reduction. This was primarily attributable to the positive impact from the sale of non-strategic marketable securities during the second quarter of 2016 that did not repeat in Q2 2017. This impact was partially offset by the previously-announced sale of our equity investment in iDevices, which had a $0.03 per share benefit. Incremental investments were a $0.05 per share reduction. These investments relate to new product development and channel initiatives, which allow us to grow faster than the market, expand our electromechanical presence, and increase our vitality index. This results in adjusted second quarter 2017 EPS of $1.11 per share, an increase of $0.12 or just over 12% compared to the prior year with the growth driven primarily by operational improvements and organic growth. We have a negative $0.01 per share reduction for acquisition and restructuring charges. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at the second quarter 2017 reported EPS of $1.10. Please go to slide number 9. Second quarter revenues for the Americas region were $468.6 million, up 7.4% on a reported basis and 6.1% organically. The strong organic growth reflects above-market performance, driven by our new products and channel initiatives, as evidenced by low-double-digit growth in electromechanical products. As noted on the chart, we experienced low-double-digit growth in residential products, driven by strength in electronics. Non-residential products saw a mid-single-digit organic growth. Pricing was strong in the quarter at nearly 3%, as we continue to effectively manage the price/cost dynamic. This quarter also saw a tough comparable driven by last year's ERP implementation, which was mostly offset by favorable timing of orders and shipments during the quarter as a result of a previously-announced price increase. On a year-to-date basis, the Americas had first-half growth of 9.6% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic basis. Americas adjusted operating income of $140.5 million increased 8.1% versus the prior-year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 20 basis points. The increase in adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin was driven by strong price and incremental volume leverage, more than offsetting the impact of inflation, unfavorable mix and incremental investments. The operational increase, while absorbing incremental investment spend, demonstrates continued excellent performance by the Americas team. Please go to slide number 10. Second quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $129.2 million, up 6.3% on both a reported and organic basis. Revenue growth was driven by strong performance in the portable security business, along with solid price performance. Currency headwinds offset the contributions from acquisitions. As mentioned previously, the organic revenue growth of 6.3% is the best organic revenue growth quarter since the spin. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $9.4 million increased 1.1% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 30 basis points, driven by unfavorable product and geographic mix along with FX headwinds. Favorable price and productivity offset the impacts from inflation and incremental investments. Please go to slide number 11. Second quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $29.2 million, up 9% versus the prior year. Organic revenue increased 7.8%, driven primarily by solid growth in the electronic products across the region. Total revenue was also supported by contributions from acquisitions, and currency had no impact during the quarter. Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $2.3 million, with adjusted operating margins down 70 basis points versus the prior-year period. Operating margins were impacted by unfavorable regional mix and an inflation. On a year-to-date basis, operating margins in Asia Pacific were up 80 basis points, reflecting good volume leverage and operating performance. Please go to slide number 12. Year-to-date available cash flow for the second quarter 2017 was $42.6 million, which is a decrease of $42.1 million compared to the prior-year period. The decrease is driven by the previously-announced $50 million discretionary pension funding payment that was made in the first quarter, partially offset by higher net earnings. Working capital as a percent of revenues and the ratio for the cash conversion cycle slightly increased in the second quarter 2017 when compared to the prior-year period. The increase is primarily driven by planned increases in inventory levels in certain areas to improve customer fulfillment requirements and the timing of revenue during the quarter. We remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital. Lastly, we are affirming our full-year available cash flow guidance of $300 million to $320 million, which is net of the $50 million discretionary pension funding payment. I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full-year 2017 guidance. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Thank you, Patrick. Please go to slide number 13. As noted on this slide, we are raising total revenue growth in all regions, given performance during the first half and our expectations for the remainder of the year. As noted, we're raising organic revenue guidance in the Americas and Europe, while reducing Asia Pacific. This results in total revenue increasing to a range of 6.5% to 7.5% and organic revenue increasing to a range of 6% to 7%. If we look closer at the Americas business, we believe that our organic investments, combined with our ability to execute, will continue to deliver better than market growth. We continue to see positive indicators in non-residential verticals and expect momentum in single-family construction to continue to support solid residential markets. European markets are being bolstered by general macroeconomic improvements such as the highest consumer confidence rate since 2008 and the lowest unemployment level since 2009. The total revenue and organic revenue growth rates are now the same, signaling that FX headwinds are not what we had anticipated when giving original guidance. In the Asia Pacific region, electronics remain a key driver of growth. Similar to EMEIA, the FX headwinds we anticipated in our original guidance are not as prevalent, which is why total revenue guidance was increased. We are raising our adjusted earnings per share to a range of $3.65 to $3.80, an increase of $0.05 on both the low end and high end. This represents adjusted EPS growth of 9.3% to 13.8%. The guidance includes a reduction of reported EPS related to restructuring and acquisition expenses in the range of $0.08 to $0.09. This brings our updated guidance for reported EPS to a range of $3.55 to $3.72. Included in the revised guidance is an assumption for the full-year tax rate to be between 18.5% and 19%. The guidance continues to assume outstanding diluted shares of approximately 96 million. Please go to slide 14. Let me finish by reiterating that I was very pleased with our second quarter execution and results. As a summary, reported revenue growth over 7%, organic revenue growth over 6%, adjusted operating margins increased 20 basis points, adjusted EPS saw just over 12% growth in the quarter. These first-half results position us well for the full year. We are raising our guidance for revenue growth both total and organic, raising our adjusted EPS outlook and we affirm our available cash flow guidance. Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions now. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. I wanted to... David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Good morning, Rich. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : How are you doing? I wanted to hit just on the non-res piece, so mid-single-digit growth, you did have a tough comp, you've really highlighted some of the channel investments starting to pay off. Dave, is there any way to kind of delineate what you're seeing on the light commercial side versus the traditional institutional side where you've had strong presence historically? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : We clearly are seeing a positive momentum in the investments in light commercial. Remember, as we talk, Rich, that that's area of the market that we didn't feel that we were as well positions and believe we can use our mid-price point products, our improved position endorsed (21:28) to go in and grow in a marketplace that we weren't as active. So we like our position and think momentum will pick up over the next year. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. All right. So it sounds like a little bit better there or we're trending a little bit better than it had been. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Yes. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then just in terms of investment spending, Patrick, can you just refresh us on the investment spending for this year? And then if we think about 2018 kind of early read on how that should trend in 2018 and then longer term if we get into some sort of meaningful slowdown in the U.S. market, how would you adjust investment spending and what are the toggles there we should be thinking about longer term as the economy hits the cyclical peak? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah, so our full-year guide on investment spending is $0.15 to $0.20 impact. That hasn't changed since our going out at the beginning of the year. We saw a little bit of uptick in Q2 that was planned. I would continue to think that Q3 be kind of a similar level, then taper down a little bit in Q4, again all according to our plan as Dave highlighted seeing some really good benefits relative to the investments both in our channel segmentation as well as new product development. I think a lot of that is helping us drive above-market growth relative to the overall industry. As we look forward to 2018, it's a little early to tell right now. As we've talked previously, we look at each year independently. Each year comes up with different potential opportunities that we look at in terms of (a) investments, how we are going to manage that relative to expectations and earnings, what's our degree and capability to execute on particular programs, but we will continue to invest in the business and believe that will continue to drive above-market performance in both revenue growth as well as earnings. Will it be higher than this year? I think probably not, but again we'll take a closer look in our planning process in the back half of this year. But your last question, what could we do in a market downturn, I mean a lot of these are variable related to the extent that some is demand creation and you could certainly shut off a spicket related to that if we needed to. Some of them are head count related. We monitor those, so that's kind of toggled basis of the \u2013 how the market's performing, how we're performing. And so, that's something if, for example, we went into the year with higher incremental investment spend and the market outlook turned south on us, we could shut that down as well. Like any good business, we would manage the cost side of the business basis of the market demand. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, good morning. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Good morning, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning. Just a quick question on price and raw materials, I guess. So pricing very, very strong in the second quarter, it's almost 2.5% after 1% in the first. Just wondered how you see the price outlook for the second half, whether you think you'll be somewhere in that sort of 1% to 2% range still like the first half. And also any update on quantifying the raw material headwind, just because obviously the last time, you may have faced a headwind from that, it was back in 2011 before the spin-off. So it's hard to see how the business would perform regarding input costs. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Yeah. So historically you go back and this business has done extremely well in terms of passing on price from incremental cost related to material inflation. Not seeing any difference. As related to Q2, pricing outpaced material cost. I think we were able to get a quick start on that. We had visibility obviously late last year. The performance was extremely strong, and I would say that's really attributable to many factors. One, obviously, you have strong markets, we're benefiting from that. Two, well-disciplined industry. Three, we've implemented some new tools to help us manage pricing better more specifically, which is helping us get better price realization, particularly in the Americas. I wouldn't expect \u2013 we had, I think, 2.4%, 2.5% price realization in the quarter. That's going to taper down probably a little bit in the back half of the year, but to your comment, 1.5% to 2% in the second half within certainly the realm of possibility, which is better than what we performed last year. We did announce a price increase in Americas to take effect August 1, which is quicker than what we've normally done historically, and so hopefully that'll have some benefit in the business as we go forward as well. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks a lot. And then just my last one would be around the margin expansion path in EMEIA? I think in the first quarter, you had had a bit of choppiness around aspects like the CISA restructuring and maybe some of the M&A integration. Any update on that, please? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So, well, first of all, as we indicated in the results, revenue growth was outstanding organically. It had the best quarter since the spin, so it's really pleased to see that. I think you're seeing a good performance from our business, but the market's improving a little bit as well, which is a good sign. Unfortunately, it didn't pull through incremental margin. It was one of those quarters that kind of had a lot of things working against us, some unfavorable one-time items, unfavorable mix both from a product, geographic perspective. FX was a headwind. The plant move that you mentioned, I'd say we've made improvements, particularly on customer delivery and performance, not out of the woods yet. It's still going to be a little bit of headwind on the cost side, but again making improvements. Our expectation is the second quarter excuse me the second half of 2017 to show incremental margin improvement both in Q3 and Q4, which will give us a full year-over-year improvement for the year, close to that 10% objective we established earlier. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : I wanted to just add in. I continue to feel very good about the progress that we make over time in Europe. The CISA move more \u2013 has a lot of complexity. There's a lot of SKUs and as we start up those SKUs in our new manufacturing capability, it put some chop into demand, but we made progress in improving customer satisfaction and reducing backlog in the quarter. I expect that to continue over the next 12 months. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning, guys. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So maybe just following on Julian's question there on price/cost. So, Dave, you think that from a pricing perspective, maybe you can kind of keep that 1.5% to 2.5% in the back half of the year. How are you guys thinking about cost and commodity inflation in the back half of the year? And specifically are you hedging any of your commodity costs? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So commodity prices particularly on steel, zinc and brass, copper will kind of stabilize, if you will, sequentially Q2 to Q1, but still continues to rise, and spot rates are higher today than they were when we ended the quarter. And so we see a continued pressure on the cost side. But again I think relative to the price/cost dynamic, hopefully we can mitigate that as we move forward on the price increase. So I kind of look at it as continued good price realization performance, cost higher than what we anticipated, but the expectation is we should be able to offset that in the second half of the year. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. So I mean the expectation then I guess for second half is that this price/cost is going to remain positive, correct? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Yes. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then my follow-on question, when I take a look at your balance sheet now, we're at a point where your gross leverage is starting to trend below your typical kind of like 2.75% to 3.25% range that you're typically at. What does your M&A pipeline look like? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So we continue to work the M&A pipeline. I have to reflect here half the time at my own performance in successful acquisitions and disappointed. It's not because of a lack of effort. I would say it's more of a lack of \u2013 it's more driven by discipline. We've looked and put our fingers in a lot of deals, and we've just not pulled the trigger because they didn't line up with our expectations. But I'd say the pipeline is active. There are several files that we're working around the world, and we'll continue to be disciplined and active and believe that we'll pull things in. With that said, our capital allocation policy continues to focus on organic growth, M&A, share buybacks. We bought back some shares in the quarter, and as we see the need to do it, we're going to move on all three of those levers. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Rizk Maidi with Berenberg. Rizk Maidi - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Yes. Good morning, guys. My first question is really on the organic revenue growth guidance for the full year of 6% to 7%. So you basically achieved 7% in H1. At 6% to 7% for the full year it means that the low end of the full-year guidance implies growth slows down to 5%. Even at the midpoint, it actually implies that growth slows down to 6% from 7% as I said. I'm just wondering why that is the case, please? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah, so I would characterize it as maybe a little cautiousness in the second half of the year. We had better visibility going into 2017, and as you indicated, really strong growth in the first half of the year, still strong performance in the second half of the year is the expectation. We did raise the guide on both organic and total revenue growth, and that's reflective of very strong first half of the year. Pretty strong organic growth in the second half of the year. I'd say a couple of things, a little cautiousness. Order intake has been a little, I'd say, choppy relative to what we saw in the first part of the year. And I think that's more from a capacity, industry perspective, and the ability to absorb all the new construction activity. So, hey, look, still the market outlook isn't changing, and we're still bullish on the market dynamics and what we're seeing in terms of bid quote activity, specification writing activity, et cetera. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I want to weigh in here too. Our organic growth, I think, globally is noteworthy. What we see in the market is variance from month to month in terms of incoming orders, and I think that variance comes from a lack of labor, especially in the Americas across the value stream. This would be our contractors, mechanical labor, wholesalers, installers. And so we think that requires some conservatism in terms of what we view. We believe that Allegion will do better in our markets based on our execution than our competition and remain extremely positive on our end markets as we look out over the next 12 months. Rizk Maidi - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Okay. Thank you. And then secondly maybe on EMEIA, the 6% organic growth you said it's the highest since the spin. Can you just give us a sense what is driving that kind of by country basis and also how large is SimonsVoss today within EMEIA, if you could just give us a sense for that, please? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So the growth is driven through the investments we've made in portable security. We like that. We think we're again executing across the country areas. We're seeing some performance based on investment initiatives similar to what we've done in the United States, spec writing, project-based business. We don't split out SimonsVoss, but we continue to be extremely pleased with the performance of that asset. Rizk Maidi - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And once again, as a reminder, we do ask you that you limit yourself to one question in consideration for the others. And our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : I actually try to probably squeeze in two, even though we just got the rule handed down there. But first, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the mix effects in your business in the quarter. It was negative in all three segments. I assume some of it's kind of the electronic dynamics and the like. But just what's going on there and the impact on margins in the quarter would be interesting. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : So, not so much on the electronics migration. That is growing faster than the overall business, and as we've talked about previously, that's a great trend for us because of the higher selling price but similar margin, so it doesn't really impact the margin profile of the business, but does contribute higher EBIT dollars which obviously we like. The mix is more a function of the \u2013 particularly in Americas the residential business growing double digit, non-res single digit and some of that's the tough comp we had relative to last year. But as you know, the residential business operates at a lower operating margin, and with a higher growth from that, you have a mix effect there. Also geographically, Europe had some unfavorable mix just based on the country mix. In Asia Pacific, it was more generated around a specific region, had a couple of one-time orders last year in North Asia that normally carried a higher margin than say in markets like China or Southeast Asia. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. And then maybe a little bit bigger picture, just watching this proliferation of do-it-yourself home security, that doesn't directly play to you, right, the voice-activated life to do-it-yourself security systems, et cetera. I mean obviously you're aligned with the big guns with the Apple HomeKit and the like, but do you see any change in just kind of the nature of what's going on in the residential market as new entrants try to find an angle into the home and how are you addressing that? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So, Jeff, we would observe that there is disruption and new thinking going on. I think it helps us sharpen our game. The second change that we see is what we call the last mile. Clearly with the growth of home delivery of goods, it changes the way people think about home security. We think there're some fundamentals that are important, number one; open platforms, being able to connect, simplicity, ease of use; third, providing a good product that's reliable that's \u2013 we've thought about our primary role, that's security. We're extremely pleased with our residential electronic growth. We see the market growing at low-double digits and we're growing above that. So we're going to continue to be nimble, think about the opportunity and try to position Allegion to be able to participate in that growth globally. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Hey, Tim. Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I guess just on the residential business, growing low-double digits, I know the comparison was a little bit easier, but is there a way that you could just elaborate a little bit on what that look like within repair/remodel or big box and then what that look like in new construction? And then is some of this being driven by some of the investments that you've made in electronics, specifically in resi? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So we feel good about what we did in the quarter across the board. I think we see some of the strongest growth in our Res-Pro, which is new construction. We had good year-over-year growth for that and you see the strength in the new construction part of it. We have made specific investments to serve that new construction market. Second, we get good traction with the electronic locks. We believe that we're gaining share in consumer confidence. Renovation investment is some of the healthy it's been since the crash and we're benefiting from that. Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Good luck on the second half, guys. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Thank you, Tim. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : Thank you. Thank you for taking the question. I'm doing a study on security integrators and also the specifiers that work with them, and we're finding out that there is a narrowing of those of the use of who the large, who the end users are using in the integration fields, smaller and smaller group. The names are far obviously familiar to you. How does that narrowing of the integration group itself as to who is being used affect your business? Do you have to \u2013 are you tailoring more or less? Is your open platform an advantage do you think for a smaller group of integrators as opposed to the dropoff the smaller and midsized guys as the larger companies and the more IT-oriented integrators in security begin to play a larger and larger role in the market share out there? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Sure. I need to see the study. If you want to share that data that comes out, it'd be helpful, but my observation would be this. You've got customers in that integration value stream across the spectrum. We think it's the higher end homes that weigh more heavily in those integration partners, people that would require high-end security systems. We think they will prefer a superior product, the technical support. I think one of the bigger challenges there, Jeff, is aesthetics. And that's why miniaturization, battery life become important, but we look at that integration of our products with other systems as a growth opportunity beyond what we're doing today, and we'll invest and focus to be able to serve that. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : Okay. And just quickly related to that, you were a smaller player in the midsized industrial market. You've obviously come on with a number of products in that area. What new types of things can we expect at some of the tradeshows coming up for you folks? You not give me anything specific, but obviously in general, how are you trying to more fully penetrate that mid-priced market? Is it just new iterations of the same and new product that you had out there or is it actually \u2013 will there be actually new lines of products coming out? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So I think about a building 10 years out, every opening will be connected. And how does that expand the opportunity at the high performance product set, which we do extremely well at, look at our mid-price point products to offer more connectivity, more intelligence and being able to bring that together and supportive. I think the opportunity, Jeff, here as it comes together, I think customers are demanding more Apple esque type systems that where customers have ease of use and connectivity, and those are the things that we think are important that will differentiate Allegion, is making it simple for the end user to operate and integrate with the systems, fire, access, alarms, potentially HVAC in a simple way. And that's where our direction will be and we think it will make a difference for Allegion. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Good morning. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a question. I think on their call, ASSA cited a double-digit growth in request for quote specifications when they're asked about the end market strength. What are you guys seeing? Are you seeing something different, something similar? And does that raise a possibility of things actually accelerating in the second half? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Your question is in terms of future demand, quotations is strong. As I go out and meet with customers, demand is strong, our backlog is healthy and we think it's reflective of how we see the next 12 to 18 months. In particular, I spent some heavy time here, I had time working with our economists, and we see good drivers in primary demand. We see this what I call incoming variance. I think the market is somewhat capped on the availability of labor, but it will push this recovery even longer and it's a little bit like a snow pile. The demand is there and we like our position in it. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And just another question. You guys are pushing into the door market in North America. Can you just tell us what the experience has been so far as you pivot the strategy towards that market where you're just sort of, not ignored for a while, but were not as active in it for many years and now you're really increasing your level of activity? And what the competitive dynamic is as you are pushing there? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Having to bake the first 24 months around doors, the role that it plays in the marketplace, our competitive positioning, we've invested in both mechanical capability and people to enhance our Steelcraft competitiveness and on-time delivery. We've acquired Republic Doors. We feel extremely good about the position that we had, but we feel you must have regional capability, laid out adaptation capability and the ability to provide that adaptation and local delivery in the markets. We're going to continue to drive that strategy. And we like the growth dimension that it gives, especially in some of these light commercial areas. We had a question earlier about that light commercial. It's helping us grow in that part of the market that was underserved by Allegion. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Terrific. Thank you very much. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski of Wolfe Research. Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Hey, Josh. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Hey, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC : Just a couple of clean-ups here since we covered a lot of ground already. I guess, first, on some of the big pushes that you guys have had particularly on the non-resi side on the engaged platform and then commercial retrofit, Dave, can you just kind of remind us how those two were doing, I guess, on the commercial retrofit side, maybe from a share perspective? Where you guys started, where you think you're at today, and then what the growth was on commercial electronic relative to rest of the portfolio? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So commercial retrofit, we'll also refer to it as channel led, we continue to build that out, but if we use a baseball analogy, we're in the sixth, seventh inning, still work to be done because it's a people-led driven thing, continues to exceed our expectations. A good part of the market, good partnering with our channel partners as well as locksmiths, so feel good about that. In terms of the electronics growth, we like the growth. It's a new market for us. The market does not adapt quickly. We're taking mechanical guys, flipping them to electronic guys and so we're moving much faster on the res, multi-family, and we think that's the opportunity for growth. Clearly, this electronics evolution will grow at low-double digits and we think we're positioned well to be able to grow in that space. Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC : Is that low-double-digits growth reflective of what's happening on the commercial side as well? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : That would be overall growth. Put the commercial institutional side as high-single-digit growth, it will adapt at a slower pace, but it will move over the next strategic planning period. Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC : Got you. And then, Dave, I think people have asked this question a few times now. Maybe I'm just not smart enough to get the finer points of it, but relative to last quarter, is price/cost a tailwind or headwind in your guidance? Did you tweak that up or down? I know that it's still kind of net neutral the tailwind on the overall, but was that toggled up or down versus the last time you guys guided? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So, slightly positive in Q2; neutral, I'd say, in the second half of the year, both price improving as well as cost inflation. Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC : Which sounds consistent with what you guys said before, if I remember right? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Right. Right. Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. All right. That's all I had. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey, guys. Good morning. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Hey, Rob. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Good morning, Rob. Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey. I wanted to clarify the comments on the pull forward activity ahead of the price increase. It sounds like that may have added three or four points to Americas in the quarter. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So, as we indicated, we went out with the price increase announced about a month prior to quarter end. We believe that had the effect of bringing forward some orders and shipments, hard to quantify, but there was a spike in some activity. It did have the effect of mitigating kind of the ERP implementation, the effect that we saw in terms of last year. So hey, look, hard to quantify in terms of whether it's three to four points. But clearly, there was some pull forward from Q3 into Q2. But I think, as I think about it, looking forward on a full-year basis, again really strong revenue growth and the outlook up 50 basis points in Americas. I would make this observation with it. We were quick to pull the trigger on that price increase. We would typically give more advanced notice, and it didn't give the pop that may create some drag in the second half. So we needed to react to the inflation that we're seeing, but it wouldn't measure up the historical price increases in terms of pulling a bunch of the volume forward. Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. I mean you had set it almost to offset the ERP, which you had quantified at three to four points, so that's where I went with that, but \u2013 so should we expect some kind of payback in third quarter or it sounds like not so much? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I'd say not so much. Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And then maybe just a couple of housekeeping items on the guidance. Could you just clarify what's changing or what was in the guide and what wasn't vis-\u00e0-vis the iDevices sale, the tax benefit $0.09 in the quarter, I think most of that was contemplated, but maybe not all and then FX kind of embedded in there versus prior? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah. So you may recall last quarter, we increased guidance, I think, by $0.05 and that was predominantly due to the iDevices gain as well as tax benefit expectations. We guided lower on the effective tax rate. So some of the benefit that we saw in Q2 was already baked in. Now basis of our full-year guide, the 19% to 18.5%, that implies second-half effective tax rate higher, low-20s say, to kind of get at that range. So there is some pressure there, if you will, year-over-year in the back half with the effective tax rate. Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And currency? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Currency. We upped our overall reported revenue growth and that's due to favorable exchange rates predominantly on translation, so it is an improvement year-over-year, but not too much flow-through in terms of earnings. Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got you. Thank you. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC : Hi. This is Robert Aurand on for David this morning. Looking at the Europe business, strong organic growth, and you called out strength in the portable security business. Can you give us a sense of maybe how more the core AXA business did there? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : How the core business did? Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC : Yes. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Strong electronics, this would come from SimonsVoss in our hospitality business. Core business, market performed. We could have done better if our supply chain was running. So you hear us talk about we moved production capabilities to Eastern Europe and we made progress on that, but we left some revenue on the table. It will get better every quarter, as we go over the next 12 months. Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC : Right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that's all the time we have right now for questions. I would like to return the call over to Mike Wagnes for any closing comments. Mike Wagnes - Allegion Plc : We'd like to thank everyone for participating on today's call. If you have any questions, please follow up with me, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Wagnes, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Wagnes : Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for Allegion's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. With me today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release, which we issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we'll refer to in today's call, are available on our website at allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website. Please go to slide number 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Please go to slide number 3. Our release and today's commentary include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of restructuring and acquisition expenses and charges in current year and prior year results. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results in comparing to the prior-year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details. Dave and Patrick will discuss our third quarter 2017 results, which will be followed by a Q&A session. For the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and then re-enter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone given the time allotted. Please go to slide number 4 and I'll turn the call over to Dave. David Petratis : Thanks Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Allegion posted another solid quarter of operational results, delivering continued margin expansion and modest organic growth. For the third quarter, revenue was $609.4 million, an increase of 4.9%, reflecting organic growth of 2.7% as well as the benefit of foreign currency and acquisitions contributing to the overall growth. All regions contributed to organic growth. Americas saw organic growth of 2.8% in the quarter, supported by strong price and mid teen's growth in electronics. The Americas business continues to see favorable trends in end markets. So constraints across the construction supply chain including labor continue to impact the completion of projects, which caused some choppiness in the timing of orders and shipments of our products. Europe had another solid quarter of organic revenue growth of 3.1%, led by strong growth in our portable security and SimonsVoss businesses. Our Asia Pacific business saw organic growth of 0.4%. Adjusted operating income of 134.6 million increased 6.2% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin increased by 30 basis points, as we continue to experience margin expansion driven by strong price and incremental volume in excess of investments and cautionary headwinds. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.02 increased $0.09 or 9.7% versus the prior year. Overall, I'm pleased with the operational performance in the third quarter. In addition, we're updating full year EPS guidance. Adjusted EPS guidance is now $3.75 to $3.80 and reported EPS guidance is $3.21 to $3.26. Please go to slide 5. Before I turn the call over to Patrick, I want to take a little time to talk about Allegion's foundation for electro-mechanical convergence and connectivity. At Allegion, we blend the best elements of our mechanical heritage with the latest technology that provides the security our customers expect, along with the convenience and connectivity they desire. That's what allows Allegion to lead the electro-mechanical convergence in the security industry today. For instance, over the last twelve months we have sold 1.5 million residential electronic walls. To best illustrate our leadership in convergence, this slide showcases the evolution of some of our residential products. On the far left you see a Schlage Mechanical Deadbolt, something that most people listening today probably grew up using. Since 1920, when Schlage was awarded the first patents for cylindrical and push-button locks, we've been pioneering in the home security hard since then. Now, our experts have been creating innovative smart locks for nearly 10 years, leading us to the products you see on the far right, our latest launch the Schlage Sense Wi-Fi Adapter. This simple lock again provides android and Apple user's access to the Schlage Sense Smart Deadbolts from anywhere. No smart home platform needed. We launched it in August along with android compatibility for the Schlage Sense Smart Deadbolt. Just like our Mechanical and leading Smart Deadbolt's, we're confident the Schlage Sense Wi-Fi Adapter will become a staple in the residential market place. We're equally confident in the bigger picture. Allegion's extensive base of mechanical and electronic solutions serves as a robust foundation and competitive advantage for our growth into the ongoing electro-mechanical convergence. Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I'll be back to discuss our full-year 2017 guidance. Patrick Shannon : Thanks, Dave and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. Please go to slide number 6. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the third quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 2.7% organic growth in the third quarter. Pricing was strong this quarter and was favorable in all regions. As a company we remain disciplined in taking necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact rising monetary functions. As a result, pricing improvements have continued to exceed material inflation. During the quarter, acquisitions contributed 1% growth and foreign currency with a tailwind particularly in the EMEIA and Asia Pacific regions. Please go to slide number 7. Reported net revenues for the quarter was 609.4 million, this reflects an increase of 4.9% versus the prior year, up 2.7% on an organic basis. I was particularly pleased with the strong price performance in all regions. The total growth was driven by favorable currency impacts, in addition to the price performance. Adjusted operating income was 134.6 million and adjusted operating margin of 22.1%, increased 6.2% and 30 basis points respectively when compared to the prior year. The operational improvement was driven by solid price and productivity, which more than offset the impacts of inflation in incremental investments. The price performance allowed us to absorb and manage through the higher inflation we experienced. The business continues to deliver both organic growth and operational margin improvement, while continuing to make investments for future profitable growth. Please go to slide number 8. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2016, reported EPS was $0.02, adjusting $0.91 for the prior loss on divestiture, restructuring expenses and integration cost related acquisitions, the 2016 adjusted EPS was $0.93. Operational results increased EPS by $0.09 with favorable price, operating leverage and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. Interest and other income were a net $0.03 per share increase, driven by non-operating gains. The combination of the adjusted effective tax rates and share count grow by $0.01per share reduction versus the prior year. The adjusted effective tax rates grow by $0.02 per share reduction. The increase in rate is primarily due to the mix of income earned in higher tax rate jurisdictions. Share count reductions increased EPS by $0.01. Incremental investments were $0.02 per share reduction. These investments relate to new product development and channel initiatives, which allow us to grow faster than the market, expand our electro-mechanical presence and increase our vitality invests. This results in adjusted third quarter 2017 EPS of $1.02 per share an increase of $0.09 or nearly 10% compared to the prior year with the growth driven primarily by operational improvements. We have a negative $0.08 per share reduction for debt refinancing costs, acquisition and restructuring charges. After giving effect to this onetime items, you arrive at third quarter of 2017 reported EPS of $0.94. Please go to slide number 9. Third quarter revenues for the Americas region were 455.2 million, up 4.4% on a reported basis and 2.8% organically. The modest organic growth was driven by strong pricing in the quarter as well as mid-teens work in the electronics products which offset the impact of timing of orders that was a positive benefit in the second quarter. The price performance continues to allow us to effectively manage the price cost dynamic. On a year-to-date basis the Americas region has had strong organic growth at 6.2%. Americas adjusted operating income of 137.1 million, increased 3.6% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 10 basis points. The decrease in adjusted operating margin is primarily driven by unfavorable product and mix in incremental investments. Please go to slide number 10. Third quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were 125.1 million up 7.5% on a reported basis and 3.1% organically. Revenue growth was driven by strong performance in both the portable security and SimonsVoss businesses along with solid price performance. Currency tailwinds also contributed to total growth. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $10.6 million increased 45.2% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 220 basis points, driven by solid price, favorable leverage on incremental volume, favorable mix and the currency tailwinds offsetting the impacted inflation in incremental investments. Our EMEIA business had strong operating performance in the quarter as we continue to focus on areas that would drive us the double-digit margin profile in that region. Please go to slide number 11. Third quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were 29.1 million, up 2.1% versus the prior year. Organic revenue increased 0.4%, driven primarily by favorable price as they drop comparable notably in Australia and New Zealand muted the volume growth. Total revenue was also supported by contributions and currency tailwinds. Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was 2.2 million, with adjusted operating margins up 130 basis points versus the prior-year period. Operating margin increases were driven by favorable price, productivity in FX more than offsetting inflationary impacts. Please go to slide number 12. Year-to-date available cash flow for the third quarter 2017 was 136.3 million, which is a decrease of 15.7 million compared to the prior-year period. The decrease is driven by the previously announced $50 million discretionary pension funding payment that was made in the first quarter, partially offset by higher net earnings. Excluding the discretionary pension payment for 2017, available cash flow increased $34.3 or 22.6% compared to the prior year period. Working capital as a percent of revenues and the ratio for the cash conversion cycle slightly increased in the third quarter 2017 when compared to the prior-year period. The increase is primarily driven by planned increases in inventory levels in certain areas to improve customer fulfilment requirements. As noted we are updating our full year available cash flow guidance to approximately 300 million, which is net of the $50 million discretionary pension funding payment. Please go to slide number 13. I want to take this time to highlight the changes from our recent debt refinancing we previously announced. During September we closed our refinancing of our credit facility and in early October we issued investment grade senior notes, the proceeds of which we used primarily to regain our previously outstanding high yield senior notes. Our outstanding debts as result of the refinancing increased slightly. However, our debt to adjusted EBITDA remained approximately the same at 2.8 times and 2.2 times on a net basis. Our refinancing in upgrades with investment grade resulted in an unsecured capital structure with maturities extending approximately three and a half years and demonstrates our financial strength and strong cash flow characteristics. It also reduces our cost of capital and future borrowing cost, which enhance our ability to form accelerated organic growth as well as future acquisitions. Lastly the refinancing will reduce our annual interest expense by approximately 13 million or $0.09 per share, a quarter which will be realized in Q4 of this year. I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full-year 2017 guidance. David Petratis : Thank you, Patrick. Please go to slide number 14. As noted on this slide, we are updating the revenue guidance in all regions. We are reducing revenue guidance in the Americas and Asia Pacific while increasing in EMEIA. This results in revised guidance range for a total revenue of 6.5% to 7% and organic revenue being revised to a range of 5% to 5.5%. If we look closer at the Americas business, end market fundamentals remain solid as we continue to see positive indicators in non-residential verticals and expect momentum in single-family construction to continue to support solid residential markets. However due to constraints across the supply including labor the industry is experiencing delays in overall project construction which has an impact on the timing of our revenue. For EMEIA region, we are raising both the total revenue and our organic revenue outlooks. European markets have started to rebound nicely and are being bolstered by continued general macroeconomic improvements such as high consumer confidence and low unemployment. For the first time in a decade the GDP in all of our key economies are growing. Total revenue growth is also being assisted by FX tailwinds in second half of the year. In the Asia Pacific region, electronics remain a key driver of the growth. Similar to EMEIA, the FX headwinds are anticipated in the original guidance are not as prevalent. As we look out to 2018, we would expect end markets to continue to grow and expect organic revenue in line with our previously provided long term profit of 4% to 6%, which includes the benefit of electronics growth as well as continued performance in our channel initiative. We are updating our 2017 adjusted earnings per share to a range of $3.75 to $3.80 this represents EPS growth of approximately 12% to 14%. This guidance includes a reduction of reported EPS related to debt refinancing cost and restructuring and acquisition expenses in the amount of $0.54. This brings our updated guidance for reported EPS to a range of $3.21 to $3.26. Included in the revised guidance is the assumption for the full-year tax rate to be between 18% and 18.5%. This guidance assumes average diluted shares count for the full year to be approximately 96 million shares. Please go to slide 15. Let me finish by reiterating that I am pleased with our third quarter execution and results. As a summary, reported revenue grew nearly 5%, organic revenue grew nearly 3%, is up 5.5% for the year, adjusted operating margins increased 30 basis points. Adjusted EPS saw just nearly 10% growth in the quarter and it's up almost 13% for the year. These results position us well to complete 2017. Now, Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Wolfe Research. David Petratis : Hi, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just maybe a bit of a follow up on some of the residential electro-mechanicals and clearly the market is off little bit in the past week or so with after picking up I guess in the Amazon key announcing yesterday. I guess you guys have a lot of partnerships out there and so have pretty good leadership position, but how would you characterize some of these changes and then could you give kind of a walkthrough of how this Amazon key maybe a future opportunity or why you guys are not part of that in the show partnership? David Petratis : So, number one we welcome the introduction of Amazon Key. We think this whole category is in its early stages, early earnings as we have said in the past maybe 3% to 5% penetration. So, we like the opportunity having intensity and what we call the last foot or last mile in terms of this delivery we think we are in a very good position with over 1.5 million locks sold year, that were installed in the residential category. We work with all players. Amazon, we are encouraged to click on and look at our products offering on Amazon, we have got the highest star ratings. Consumer reports rates our e-lock as best in class and we think it's opportunity plus. We continue to have having investments to be able to work and with our open platform approach to be able to grow the category. So, I think there is a bevy features that are loaded into our lock in terms of its design and robustness that gives us a leadership position. Whether it's Amazon, Google, Siri, Control4, there is a variety of operating platforms that we compile with and we like our position. Josh Pokrzywinski : But there is nothing proprietary in what's coming out what's I guess the new key platform that Schlage couldn't fit into eventually. David Petratis : No. And I can encourage we may be - with our presence in this market place maybe a little bit more insightful on some of the opportunities and pit falls as you are inviting people into the home. Remember some of the early challenges with voice activation on which side of the door, we think thinking through these details and in this case maybe not being the first, but a follow will be a good position for legend. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Thanks for that. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning guys. David Petratis : Good morning. Joe Ritchie : Can we maybe just touch on the Americas for a little bit? And if - David maybe you can talk a little bit more about the constraints that you are seeing on labor and on the project side. How much of an impact do you guys estimate that has happen this quarter, that it impacted this quarter and then as you think about the upcoming quarter, it seems like you are inviting in acceleration in the Americas in your guidance so maybe talk a little about what you are thinking about for $Q as well? David Petratis : So, we would say in the quarter maybe two points of overall growth. What are something is driving that number one if you have heard me over the last year, I have talked about constraints in the market place. Construction, unemployment is that the lowest since 2001. There is clearly tightness in the job markets. We had our top distributors in Chicago early September and general consent is was their backlogs had never been higher and their ability to turn on had never been lower and talked about constraints from the architectural level right down to install, so there is clearly some constriction in the market. I would include also in that commercial doors normally would run two to four-week leave times they run long all year and in 8 to 12-week range. This significantly impacts our commercial. We hang all of our stuff on door. So that constriction appears. We think some of that will move through in Q4. If not, a constraint that's going away in '18 or '19, we actually think it pushes the expansion further ahead. I think as we look at '18 and the long term we like our view in terms of the continued end market performance. We think about education, healthcare, single-family. We like the continued expansion of that. We see some slowdown in multifamily. It's not one of our sweets spots. We actually think our lack of share in that position in electronics and some of the things we are investing and will give us growth. So that's how we see it. Joe Ritchie : Okay that's helpful. I guess just a maybe follow up on that comment so, is it fair to say then if it - from an end market perspective outside of multi-family you are not really seeing much the slowdown whether there is some this timing related things that impacted the quarter and moving forward do you expect to see the acceleration come back in like what's 4Q and in early part of next year, is that fair? David Petratis : It's extremely fair and I would reemphasis as we look to '18 and '19 and spend significant time understanding our end markets, we believe our long-term growth projections in 4% to 6% is bought on. I think it also put some challenges on a region in terms of the jobs we pick in that overabundance of backlog when you think about constraints in the market place, we will get sharper in making sure that we are putting our resources behind the jobs that we believe will move through. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That makes sense. One last question on pricing, I know that you guys were planning cut through a pricing in August fairly it was a strongest quarter, strong as it was last quarter. Did you already thought to feel some of the impact of that pricing this quarter or is that really more on the time for 4Q? David Petratis : And we benefited in this quarter there will some carry forward for the balance of the year, but the expectations you are probably not going to see a stronger price realization as Q4 as what you saw in Q3. Joe Ritchie : Okay, got it. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Timothy Wojs with Baird. Timothy Wojs : Hey, guys good morning. David Petratis : Good morning. Timothy Wojs : So, I just maybe just an update a little bit on the investment spending. I see that it recently the Americas business I think it had slowed down a little bit maybe versus what you guys had done in the first half so, just an update on kind of what you expect to spend from investment perspective in 2017 and then maybe any preliminary thoughts on 2018. Thanks. David Petratis : Yeah, so we had - when we started the year had provide some original guidance with a range of $0.15 to $0.20 year-to-date I think we are at the $0.11 year-over-year incremental investment spend up you know for Q4 for the full year I would say probably at the low end of that guidance is not a little bit lower. So, anticipate Q4 to kind of be after it maybe a little bit higher than what you saw in Q3. As we look forward to 2018, we will provide more specific guidance when we report Q4 results in February. But kind of we had indicated previously we look at it relative to market conditions, what are the opportunities, what's the capacity, can we accelerate things like electric products and at option rates those type of things. So, more color to come there we can balance that relative to market conditions. So slower market would be in less investment the kind of manage earnings going forward so. Timothy Wojs : Okay, great. Good luck for the rest of the year. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Thank you very much. Just wanted to circle back on the labor source of just in the Americas issue, so I guess I find it interesting that you had raised your organic growth guide in the region slightly back in July then you are lowering it today. So just trying to understand what point did you see a sudden shift in this aspect of constraints and I guess what's your confidence so conviction level in the visibility of the growth guidance for Q4. My guess is it implies volume growth about 2% or 1.5% in the Americas in Q4, so I just intrigue sort of how quickly and when things really change that they're cosy to move from an increase in the guide to a reduction within the three months. Patrick Shannon : So, if you look back on the year - first half of the year was pretty high. It doesn't mean that their product was always installed. So, we actually saw a deceleration in July, but I think as we would have said at the end of our Q2 call we plan this business for a year-to-date basis. We are - I think well within the range that we forecasted. We saw tightness in the labor market. Is that going to affect our projects, ultimately yes, but it clearly was an evident in the first half of the year. I would also say this there is some new answers to our business. Our strong position in K12 in college campuses sets us up for that strong first half their products have to be on side to be able to take care of the summer upgrades and its part of how the business works and companies if the labor availability would have been there, we would have shipped more products. David Petratis : I would you say Julian, that you know we cannot look at the fun end of the business in terms of specifications, bit code activity still very strong market conditions that the fundamentals we can have in change and that state fairly consistent kind of throughout the quarter. You know the follow up perhaps in billing revenue is more back end loaded towards the quarter. You know the Q4 guide is little bit higher than what we saw in Q3 and basis of what we are seeing in the market place if you locate on that. I would also add I think we worked extremely hard with our economic forecasters over in the last four years they have a view. I think we generally had good perspectives on the health of our end markets and confident in our 4% to 6% growth going forward into'18. Julian Mitchell : Thanks, and then just one quick follow up. I think pricing sorry not pricing volumes mix at negative slightly in the Americas in Q3 even though I think non-resi out grew res in the quarter so maybe just give any color you can on the mix issue. David Petratis : Yeah, now actually it went the other way. As we indicated - the really good growth on electronic products that was driven heavily from the residential segments, so the residential business which all of you know has a lower margin profile actually have grew the non-residential segment and that was contributing to the mix that we highlighted in the quarter and drove the margins slightly down year-over-year in the Americas segment. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you and the next question comes from Richard Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Richard Kwas : Hi, good morning. Just when we think it on late July when you gave the outlook updated outlook for the year, what was the expectation for volume in the Americas at that time. I assume it wasn't zero when you look at volume mix, but what is the way to quantify that or think about that relative to your initial internal expectations. David Petratis : So, I have to go back and look at those specifics. On the slide we give the revenue guiding. You got that doubt for there in terms of total reported in organic growth. So, the organic growth number of course included in that component would be the volume as well as price and pricing. I think we had it maybe a 150 to 200 basis points type of range and, so you deduct that from the organic growth and you kind of get the volume number. So, it's higher than what we are anticipating. Pricing actually being a little bit longer or so many better and so always the change in the guidance if you will, is all volume related. Richard Kwas : And that's all the stuff that's still in backlog or in your terms of being in a project and then just been pushed basically is the message or? David Petratis : That is the clear message. I read some commentary of coming out of Dallas and the Florida regions not related to hurricane, but just project delays that have been showed in the '18. Richard Kwas : And then just touching on capital allocation here so limited M&A here year-to-date you have talked not building cash you got a buyback in place. How should we think about that? David Petratis : So as we have indicated our capital deployment strategy in a balanced flexible disciplined approach, our process is way-to-way indicated leads with investments in driving organic growth then M&A and then perhaps shareholder distributions, I would say particularly from the M&A perspective very active pipeline, lot of focus in the fire and I feel fairly confident to put some points on the board here within the next three months and so that's why you haven't seen a as long as long we have some capital deployment. So, stay tuned more to come on that. Richard Kwas : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Brett Linzey : Hi, good morning, it's Brett Linzey in for Jeff. David Petratis : Good morning, Brett. Brett Linzey : Hey, just wanted to come back the pricing obviously strong in the quarter again. I guess as you look at those pricing measures is it primarily related to a price to cover inflation or you getting some help from new products or FX maybe some finer point there. David Petratis : So, it's predominantly to cover inflation so anything related to new products would come through in the volume side. So, when we calculate price it's really year-over-year same products and obviously we have been fairly active and going forward price increases. We have got better tools now to measure better alignments relative to in centres etcetera. So, I think from an overall management perceptive operational excellence we have done a very good job across the globe to try to maximize price to clearly offset the commodity price increases. Brett Linzey : Okay and then maybe just back to the end market so I mean cycle duration is obviously a big topic here as you unbundle both the commercial markets and your institutional markets you look at your front lines [ph] your project metrics. What are those telling you in terms of visibility into '18 between both institutional and commercial? David Petratis : We see positives in education, healthcare. In our commercial will be about the same level as it was in '17. So, we see good opportunities, as we look at the '18 in those verticals. Brett Linzey : Okay great and thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Saliq Khan with Imperial Capital. Saliq Khan : Hi, good morning everyone. David Petratis : Good morning. Saliq Khan : Hi, Dave two question kind of whole lot of this early is low but if you still go looking at the clue that you guys got if I strip out the overall price inflation from currency, how does your strategy change overall going to the 2018 being able to get better volume not on the North America because I know that is a sign in the interest in market right now. If I look across the globe, how will your strategies change, will you be able to push up more products and increase the volume. David Petratis : So, in Europe we are going to continue to push electronics and the bundling around projects. Some of the same channel initiatives that we deployed in the U.S. and the Americas we believe have opportunity in Europe and the Middle East. That's big project based that leads with our electronics. In Asia Pacific continued growth again in the electronics we think our mill rate and SimonsVoss offerings as well as the introduction of the Schlage electronic brands puts us in a great position for growth. And in Asia Pacific that's not only driven by new product introductions but the quality of our products, lots of electronics up there that have high failure rates. We really provide that Asian customer base the high-quality product that puts us on a good position. Saliq Khan : So, one follow if it is worth, that is as in lot of technology changes across the industry and across the region as well. So, if you look out into 2018, all the currently solutions out there some alluded to August won't be in a quarter [indiscernible] earlier, are there other solutions out there that you find interesting that you think could be a great addition to your product portfolio. David Petratis : There are - I think if I got a decade the connected building the connective institutions going to create I think outstanding opportunity for a region to expand the penetration of electronic locks. We think the app the portion and connectivity solutions in working with a variety of building control platforms are important better grounds and we have got investment and top leadership going after that including partnerships with Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Siemens and Amazon, Apple, Google as well. These I know - I see yesterday's news in terms of the connectivity with the Amazon, we work with them every day as a supplier as well as a partner on connectivity. Saliq Khan : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Yes, good morning everyone. I guess I want to ask you a question David on the discretionary commercial market. I know this is an area where you have done a lot of work for some time, but this segment contributes to growth and maybe can you talk about how competitive conditions maybe your discretionary commercial business. Thanks. David Petratis : I would say in our channelized initiatives working with lock smith and wholesale distributors continue to exceed our expectations. The competitive positioning certainly there is [indiscernible] we think we're in a nine-inning game we probably in the fourth and fifth there is more work to be done. Our deployment of human resources will be completed this year and we like the upside part of it. It also gives us confidence that as we move in '18 we will see the benefits of that. David MacGregor : And I guess just regard to your discussion about negative mix in Americas I know you have been harder on Falcon and some of the lower price point brands. Are these gaining share and if so are you seeing any capitalization on the premium brands. David Petratis : They are gaining share. I would like to think that again a position comes from our competitors, but as you see projects push out one of the reasons they do push out is there is value engineering going on in the project because the prices escalations by us and primarily steel. In commercial and institutional building so, general contractor will say do I have the ability to trade off our premium brand to the Falcon brands, we think the work that we have done to solidify and enhance those brands helps us to grow. Remember historically David, we just walk away from them. We say okay, its value engineered they are not going with our premiums today we stay engaged and we think it helps us grow. David MacGregor : Okay, thanks. Just one quick follow up, in Europe, what was the organic growth excluding portable security in SimonsVoss. David Petratis : I don't know the number well to give back to your math. David MacGregor : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Robert Barry : Hi, guys good morning. David Petratis : Good morning Robert Barry : Actually, I just wanted to clarify something you said really, or did you say that non-rents was up mid single and the resi up low or the resi was up mid single and the non resi up low single. David Petratis : The question with mix is that the volume from resi was up more when you look at the commercial business that revenue growth was driven more by price, so that the resulted into negative mix between the two. Robert Barry : Was there any significant difference in the growth between the aftermarket and the new construction components of resi and/or non-res? David Petratis : Nothing that we saw there is any difference relative to the mix. Robert Barry : So, I think if it is like the labor constraint issue might be appear more pressure in the construction piece of the business versus the other which is more consumer driven. David Petratis : I have had face-to-face consider discussions with general contractors as well as lock smiths, electricians they are all beating about it. Robert Barry : Yeah, it just broad labor availability. I guess just last question on demand in electricity do you think that's relevant here at all higher prices impacting the volume or causing any mix down. David Petratis : I don't think that's happening at all. Robert Barry : Got you, okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you and as there are no questions I would like to return the call over to Mike Wagnes for any closing comments. Mike Wagnes : We'd like to thank everyone for participating in today's call. Please contact me for any further questions and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Please go to Slide 4 and I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave Petratis : Thanks Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. In the fourth quarter, Allegion posted strong operational results. With one of the most engaged and safest workforce in the industry; Allegion once again delivered a high level of execution and performance. For the fourth quarter, revenue came in at $623 million, growing 6.1% on an organic basis. Total revenue increased 9.4% over the prior year reflecting strong organic growth and the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency tailwinds. The strong organic growth was driven by all regions. Americas organic revenues grew at 4.8% as the business rebounded nicely from softer performance in the prior quarter. Business continued to see solid price performance and again saw mid-teens electronics growth. EMEIA delivered outstanding organic growth of 7.7% driven across most products and geographies. In particular, SimonsVoss, AXA, and Interflex businesses saw strong top-line growth. Asia-Pacific organic revenues grew extremely well at 16.4% driven predominantly by the China hardware and Milre businesses. Adjusted operating income of $135.4 million increased 32.7% versus prior year. Adjusted operating margin increased by 380 basis points, 260 basis points of the improvement is related to an environmental remediation charge taken in the prior year. The operating performance, excluding the environmental charge, reflected continued price realization and solid leverage on incremental volume which more than offset headwinds from inflation and incremental investments. All three regions saw significant improvements in adjusted operating margins. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.11 increased $0.30 or 37% versus the prior year. This includes the environmental remediation charge in the prior year which had $0.10 per share impact. Reported earnings per share of $0.10 decreased $0.67 versus the prior year. The decrease is driven by one-time charges related to U.S. tax reform and debt refinancing cost which had impacts of $0.56 and $0.40 per share respectively. These were partially offset by the $0.10 impact of the prior year environmental charge mentioned previously. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the strong fourth quarter revenue growth and operational performance. Please go to Slide 5. Now I'd like to talk about Allegion's accomplishments in 2017. We continue to have exceptional occupational and safety record and continue to be a safety leader in our industry. At Allegion, we believe that safety and health is the true north measurement of business excellence. The recognition received from the National Safety Council in January of this year is a reflection of the hard work and importance that our company places on employee's safety and health. In December of 2017, Allegion was also recognized by the Wall Street Journal as one of the best run companies. It's my belief that this is a reflection of our highly engaged management team driving a system of continuous improvement that harmonizes with our workforce and makes Allegion a great place to work, as well as a great investment for shareholders. Moving onto revenue, we delivered solid organic growth in all regions. Americas and Asia-Pacific continued their success, while the European region recovered nicely in 2017. We continue to execute on our channel initiatives to drive above market growth and continue to focus on innovation to accelerate new products for the market, increasing our vitality index, and remain a leader in the digital convergence. In addition, we've seen continued strong operating leverage and expansion of adjusted operating margins in all regions. We delivered an 18.6% increase in full-year adjusted earnings per share and had another solid cash flow year. Please go to Slide 6. Allegion recently announced acquisitions that demonstrate our commitments to deploying capital to drive shareholder value. We continue to focus on opportunities that fill product gaps, expand our business, and provide new innovative technologies that can be leveraged across the global enterprise and provide solid financial returns. In January, we acquired Technical Glass Products, a leading U.S. manufacturer of advanced fire-rated glass and frames for doors, entrances, and curtain walls. TGP is focused on institutional and non-residential projects, provides a strong path to Allegion's floor business and will leverage the strength of our existing specification writing capabilities to help accelerate growth. TGP customers and distributors will benefit from access to the full range of Allegion's product offerings. At the beginning of February, we formally closed on our acquisition of QMI, which was originally announced at the end of last year. QMI is one of the Middle East largest manufacturers of conventional steel and wood door and frame. QMI product offerings are closely aligned with Allegion's core business and specification capabilities and it provides customers with full door solutions in the Middle East. All of this supports our strategy to accelerate Allegion's growth in this fast growing region and EMEIA as a whole. And finally, last week, we announced our intent to acquire AD Systems, a U.S. innovator and door solutions. AD Systems designs and manufactures high-performance interior healthcare door system specializing in sliding and acoustics solutions. These solutions are seen across the U.S. healthcare and commercial office spaces because of their think design that provides acoustic control, privacy, and ADA compliance. AD Systems is a natural fit with Allegion's already strong door and door control brands and will further enable our teams to offer best full suite solutions to customers. All together these newest additions to the Allegion family represent leading brands and natural portfolio extensions that leverage our strong spec-writing capabilities and vertical market presence in healthcare and commercial office buildings. As we move forward to 2018, we will continue to use a disciplined approach through strategic acquisitions that drive shareholder value. Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I'll be back to update you on our full 2018 guidance. Patrick Shannon : Thanks, Dave, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. Please go to Slide number 7. This slide highlights the components of our revenue growth for both the fourth quarter and full-year. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 9.4% total growth and 6.1% organic growth in the fourth quarter. The full-year delivered total growth of 7.6% with organic growth of 5.7%. I was particularly pleased with the outstanding organic growth from all regions. The strong organic growth reflects the continued execution of the company's growth initiatives, the introduction of new products, and strong growth in electronics portfolio. Pricing was once again favorable in the quarter closing out a strong full-year performance in all regions as the company remained discipline in taking necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of rising commodity prices. Foreign currency was a tailwind in the quarter and the full-year particularly in the EMEIA region, acquisition also contributed to total revenue growth. Please go to Slide number 8. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $623 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 9.4% versus the prior year, up 6.1% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $135.4 million and adjusted operating margin of 21.7% increased 32.7% and 380 basis points respectively when compared to the prior year. The margin improvement was driven by strong operational results, with pricing and productivity more than offsetting the impacts of inflation and incremental investments. Included in the 2016 numbers is a $15 million environmental remediation charge which had a 260 basis point impact on the adjusted operating margin in that quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.3% was also a 380 basis point increase versus the prior year, and similar to adjusted operating margin mentioned earlier, includes the impact of the 2016 environmental remediation charge. Full-year adjusted operating margins were 21% and were up 140 basis points versus the prior year. Strong operational performance drove the increase. Margin expansion was also aided by the 70 basis points from the impact of 2016 environmental charge. This represents record performance in the fourth consecutive year with improved adjusted operating and EBITDA margins, as Allegion continues to execute at a high level demonstrating both strong organic growth and operational margin improvement. Please go to Slide number 9. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter 2016 reported EPS was $0.77 adjusting $0.04 for the prior year restructuring expenses and integration costs related to acquisitions, the 2016 adjusted EPS was $0.81. Operational results increased EPS by $0.18 as favorable volumes, price, operating leverage, and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. As noted previously, the impact of the 2016 environmental remediation charge drove a $0.10 increase. Next interest and other income were a net $0.05 increase. This was driven primarily by the reduced interest expense resulting from the company's debt refinancing that took place earlier in the quarter. Share count reductions drove an increase of $0.01. Incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel strategies were $0.02 reduction. The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate drove a $0.02 per share reduction versus the prior year. Both fourth quarter 2017 and 2016 effective tax rates benefited from the favorable discrete items recorded in the respective quarters. This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2017 EPS of $1.11 per share, an increase of $0.30 or 37% compared to the prior year. Further we have a negative $1.01 per share reduction for acquisition and restructuring charges, as well as impacts of $0.56 and $0.40 from charges related to U.S. tax reform and debt refinancing costs respectively. After giving effects to these one-time items, you'll arrive at fourth quarter 2017 reported EPS of $0.10. Please go to Slide number 10. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $436.1 million, up 6.4% on a reported basis and up 4.8% organically. The organic growth was driven by volume and price, as we experience mid-single-digit growth in both non-residential and residential products. Additionally, the Americas saw another quarter of mid-teens growth in electronics products. Americas adjusted operating income of $123.9 million increased $27.2 million or 28.1% versus the prior year period. $15 million of the increase was due to the 2016 environmental remediation charge mentioned earlier. Even after excluding the impact of the charge, Americas saw strong operational performance as adjusted operating income increased due to incremental volume leverage, price, and productivity more than offsetting the impacts from inflation, incremental investments, and unfavorable mix. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 480 basis points, 370 basis points of the improvement was driven by the impact of the prior year environmental charge. The remaining strong operational increase demonstrates excellent performance and execution by the entire Americas team. For the full-year, the Americas region delivered adjusted operating margin of 28.8% continuing to expand our industry-leading margins. The region continued its strong operational performance. The full-year impact to the Americas region from the prior year environmental charge was 90 basis points. Please go to Slide number 11. Fourth quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $150.8 million, up 16.5% and up 7.7% on an organic basis. The reported revenue growth was driven by the impact of a strong organic growth along with currency tailwinds. Organic growth was attributable to growth across most business units and geographies with particular strength in SimonsVoss, AXA, and Interflex. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $24.8 million increased 24.6% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 100 basis points reflecting continued operational improvements driven by the benefits of price and volume leverage more than offsetting the impact of inflation and unfavorable mix. Full-year adjusted operating margin came in 10.2% an increase of 90 basis points over the prior year. At the time of the spin-off, adjusted operating margin for those business was approximately 1%, we had a stated goal of reaching 10%. Reaching that goal is a significant achievement and highlights the hard work and success of the entire EMEIA team. Please go to Slide number 12. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $36.1 million, up 19.1% versus the prior year. Organic revenue was up 16.4% and was driven by strong performance across most geographies and product portfolios with the Milre business acquired in 2015 and our business in China leading the way. Favorable currency impacts also benefited total reported revenue. Asia-Pacific adjusted operating income of $4.7 million was up 104.3%. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 540 basis points reflecting leverage on the incremental volume along with productivity more than offsetting inflation and investment impacts. The full-year adjusted operating margin for Asia-Pacific was 8.4%, an outstanding performance by the entire Asia-Pacific team in representing an increase of 240 basis points as Allegion leverages strong organic growth into strong margin expansion. Please go to Slide number 13. Available cash flow for 2017 was $297.9 million versus $335 million in the prior year. The decrease in year-over-year available cash flow was attributable to the $50 million discretionary pension payment made earlier in the year partially offset by higher net earnings. Working capital as a percent of revenues in the ratio for the cash convergence cycle increased slightly in 2017. Please go to Slide number 14. As you are aware the U.S. Federal Government passed tax reform late last year. The legislation reduced the federal statutory rate in the U.S. from 35% to 21%, while at the same time limiting certain deductions in various other aspects of the tax bill. As a result of the new legislation, we recorded a $53.5 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2017 results primarily related to revaluation of deferred tax assets due to the reduced future statutory rate and uncertainty around our ability to realize deferred tax assets that were previously recorded. In addition, the tax reform included a repatriation tax on foreign earnings. However, as Allegion is an Irish domicile company, we only incurred a minimal cash repatriation tax. As we evaluate the impact on 2018 and beyond, we expect our long-term tax rate to remain in the mid-to-high teens with an estimated tax rate of approximately 16% in 2018. In addition, we expect to see increase on our 2018 cash taxes as a result of tax reform inclusive of one-time payments. Finally, the law is complex and future interpretation of the legislation is expected from the U.S. government and regulatory agencies, which may result in future discrete impacts of our tax rate primarily related to the one-time charge of $53.5 million mentioned earlier. I'll now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full-year 2018 guidance. Dave Petratis : Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide number 15. We continue to see favorable trends on our primary end markets in 2018 and it is our expectation that the organic investments, combined with our ability to execute, will again drive better than market growth. We also believe the electronics business will continue to outpace mechanical which additionally benefit our growth as we are well-positioned to continue to take advantage of this industry trend. In the Americas, we see positive indicator in the key verticals within the non-residential and residential businesses and expect both markets to remain solid and grow in the low-to-mid-single-digits. If there is relief in the labor constraints and the supply chain, we would expect better market growth as underlying macro trends are expected to remain strong. Consolidating the market outlook, we project organic revenue growth in the Americas up 4% to 5% and recorded revenue growth of 10% to 11% reflecting the inclusion of the acquisitions of TGP and AD Systems. For the EMEIA region, we anticipate growth in core markets to be low-single-digits as the markets in the region continue to rebound. General macro-economic indicators such as manufacturers' confidence, consumer confidence, and unemployment rates continue to be positive. For the region, we project organic growth of 2% to 4%. When combining that with the impact of currency, and the acquisition of QMI, we project reported growth of 13% to 15%. The Asia-Pacific markets continue to show strength in China and North Asia with a more modest growth outlook for Australia and New Zealand markets. We expect to drive above market growth as we continue to focus our efforts on key vertical markets where we are strong. Organic growth in the region is estimated to be 6% to 8% and the total revenue growth is estimated to be 8% to 10% reflecting benefits from currency tailwinds. All-in, we are projecting total growth for the company at 10.5% to 11.5% and organic growth at 4% to 5%. We anticipate continued price realization across all regions to help mitigate inflationary pressures in 2018. Please go to Slide 16. Our 2018 outlook for adjusted earnings per share range is $4.35 to $4.50, an increase of approximately 10% to 14%. As indicated, the earnings increase is primarily driven by revenue growth and operational improvements, a lower effective tax rate, tailwind from currency, and the benefit of acquisitions, partially offset by investments in the business. Incremental investments are anticipated to be slightly lower than the prior year and will continue to focus on accelerating new product developments and channel initiatives which we believe enable us to deliver above market growth and enhance our vitality index as demonstrated historically. Our guidance assumes that full-year effective tax rate of approximately 16% and outstanding diluted shares of approximately $96 million reflecting the company's goal to at least offset share dilution with repurchases. The guidance also includes a $0.15 per share impact from restructuring charges and acquisition-related costs during the year. As a result, EPS is $4.20 to $4.35. We are projecting our available cash flow for 2018 to be in the range of $380 million to $400 million. Please go to Slide 17. We are very pleased with our 2017 results that deliver organic revenue of 5.7% and increased our operating margin by 140 basis points and by 70 basis points after excluding the impact of the prior year environmental remediation charge. The growth of both revenue and margin, while making investments in our business, demonstrates continued execution on our strategy, along with a disciplined approach to managing our business. We continue to make progress on our vitality index with new and innovative products, while we also continue to consistently generate strong cash flow. We are executing on our flexible capital allocation strategy, as evidenced by our recent acquisition announcements, along with the increase in our Q1 dividends. As we look to 2018, we expect to drive continued organic growth above market and expect the impact of acquisitions to help drive robust top-line growth. We look to drive another double-digit increase in adjusted earnings per share and look to generate substantial available cash flow. We have an excellent team in place that's committed to our vision to make the world safer, securing the places where people thrive. Thank you to be Allegion Board of Director and the Global Allegion team for a great 2017. Here at Allegion, our best days are ahead of us. Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. John Walsh : Hi, good morning. This is actually John Walsh on for Jeff. Dave Petratis : Good morning, John. John Walsh : So as we think about well first solid quarter, and then, as we think about the 4% to 5% you're looking for in the Americas in 2018 that 5% is that still like a cap or meaning we've heard in the past around constraints around the market, labor, things like that? Or do you think that if the macro comes in a little bit better there is actually an ability to drive that higher from a market perspective? Dave Petratis : I like our opportunities to be stronger. I think we have to be realistic in the labor constraints that I see and have identified for the last year. If those labor constraints work themselves through, we will exceed the market growth. I always believe, and we believe here at Allegion, that if the market is better we will do better than our share. We've also been mindful in the projects that we're quoting and bidding. There is good projects and there is bad projects out there that go on time, trying to pick the right horses, if you will. I would say this John, we've got data out there that says general construction backlogs are at all-time highs, and the opportunity for us to excel in that environment I think is positive. John Walsh : Hey, thank you for that. And then, I guess just as we think about the investment spend going forward, I would suspect we should continue to model incremental growth but maybe at a slowing rate; is that the way to think about that? Patrick Shannon : So, as we indicated for 2018, the incremental spend year-over-year is up, but down relative to the prior year. So we look at it relative to opportunities in the marketplace, and as Dave indicated, we're really looking at continuing to expand our channel initiatives, market segmentation, driving demand creation particularly in electronics as well as accelerating new product development. We like the opportunities there and believe to-date the investments have provided a good return on those investments and so to some extent, it does come down to management capacity to be able to execute on some of those opportunities but each year we look at separately and it doesn't mean for example, in 2019, if there is some opportunities that we see in identifying the marketplace that could accelerate grow faster than the broader market that we could step-up those investments. So I would just say, it's dependent upon market situations, opportunities, and what else is going on in the business relative to the incremental spend year-over-year. But thus far I've been very pleased with results we've gotten in terms of driving incremental revenue growth relative to the market. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Just a question on European operations, you sort of highlighted brands that are growing you did not highlight CISA, can you give us a sense as to what's happening in Italy, Spain, and what's happening with production move to Eastern Europe, if you could highlight, if growth rates associated with that and efficiency associated there? Dave Petratis : CISA and Italy was the part of the growth we enjoyed in the quarter and the year. The supply chain under pressure all year got better every quarter. We continue to develop that capability and improve customer satisfaction. So I think we're in a good position to take advantage of better Italian markets and regions that CISA fix -- or serves in 2018. Andrew Obin : And what about your channel initiative, I know that you guys sort of tweaked the channel going after new projects, are we seeing any outgrowth related to that and I'm speaking about Europe? Dave Petratis : Yes, our channel initiatives that we pioneer here in the Americas has been expanded to Asia-Pacific and in Europe. We're in the throes of some channel analysis right now in Europe. And I think as we understand more intimately our opportunities, I think it's reflective in our growth; I think it's reflective in our acquisitions. We're extremely well-positioned in the Middle East, QMI adds to that, and this belief that we can drive granular growth through better challenges, initiatives Andrew is part of the -- I think the success you\u2019re seeing in 2017 that will extend to 2018. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo. Rich Kwas : On the acquisitions that have been completed, how should we think about the margins here for the business, it looks -- the businesses acquired looks like it's a bit below what you would at least when you look at the Americas piece, I know doors in general tend to carry lower margins, but anything you would note there in terms of cost synergies or revenue synergies which do you think are more important for the various deals? Dave Petratis : So like all of the transactions, I believe good product portfolios, brand positions, very good market position in the respective areas, like the growth prospects predominantly as we look at opportunities to leverage our specification, writing capabilities, as well as getting more throughput through our distribution. So I think we'll see that across all of those acquisition opportunities. So like the upside relative to the revenue and top-line. From the margin profile, as you know, we have industry margins across the globe and these transactions will be dilutive, they are lower than our overall margin profile, but nonetheless still strong contributors in terms of operating performance. So continuous improvement in margins across the globe, but this will dilute, if you will, the overall margin profile of the company in 2018. Patrick Shannon : Rich, I would add that the spec driven nature of these products AD Doors and TGP would be in the upper -- a few benchmark door manufacturers those margins would be in the upper end. There is clearly a performance basis that drives premium in market versus the door side. Rich Kwas : Okay. So it appears like revenue synergies are more tangible maybe that cost synergies in the next couple of years? Dave Petratis : Correct. Rich Kwas : Okay, all right. And then, Patrick, on price cost for the year, you said you would be able to cover costs how should we think about price contribution at this point for the year? Patrick Shannon : So for 2018, we would anticipate that we would continue to offset or be above the commodity cost pressure. As you know, the commodity costs have continued to increase particularly in the backend of 2017 and the first part here in 2018 but we would expect to continue to remain fairly aggressive to recover that cost increase. So we see it as a net positive for 2018 maybe not to the extent we saw in 2017, you may recall we're out pretty early with price increases during the course of the year and got really good price realization across the board, but nonetheless it's still going to be a net contributor to margin expansion for 2018. Rich Kwas : Great. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital. Jeff Kessler : Hi. Could you expand a little bit on what you were doing well with your partner programs around the world, you mentioned obviously Europe, and Asia-Pac, taking the cue from the Americas. But I'm wondering if you could talk about what you were doing -- what's your overall goal this year to make the channel more efficient and whether or not there are any opportunities in direct as well? Dave Petratis : So I give one example that we'll be in the second year here in the U.S. and it's our project-based business. We think with labor constraints in the marketplace there is opportunities to streamline specification process, provide total packages which would include door offerings with ourselves and partners, hardware packages that will reduce cycle times in light commercial and multi-family. A second example would be partnering with architects and our spec riders in investment we called Chorus, which automates spec writings and the take-off capabilities against shortening lead times and hopefully helping us grow in the marketplace, so a couple of examples. We've extended project-based examples to Europe; we think the addition of QMI helps us there. Jeff I don't know if you've ever been to Asia-Pacific or not Asia-Pacific but the Middle East I assume you have, you get off the airport there, you see our strengths in U.S. specified products, we believe we're in a unique position to service both European and U.S. specs that is being done with partnerships here with our spec writers in North America, so a couple examples there what we're doing. Jeff Kessler : Okay. On that same line of thinking is -- have you because Europe is somewhat different and almost in every country, nevertheless you have a history here of being ahead of the game in terms of relationships with architects, spec writers, what is -- what are you doing in Europe on a -- either on a continental basis or on a country-by-country basis to try to mimic what you're doing here? Dave Petratis : So we are making investments in spec writing capabilities, we're talking bodies of the systems as well as what's called digital investments that can help connect that project capabilities. We also think some of the success of SimonsVoss which we're very pleased with as we extend that into the regions out of the dark zone is helping us have a stronger project-based capability. So again we've got a long way to go here but extending the knowledge and strength that we have from North America into Europe and Asia-Pacific we think, is unlocking some growth opportunities for us, Jeff. Jeff Kessler : Okay, great. One final question that is over the course of the next year there will be several trade conferences, trade shows out there, what are some of the newer -- the newer technologies that you are -- that you have been messing around with, that maybe able to see and touch over the course of the coming 12 to 18 months? Dave Petratis : So I would encourage you to step in and talk to our technical people if they're on top of it. We continue to invest our vitality index increases for the fourth straight year. I think we're really working on this overall customer experience and how digital access your smart devices can enable a seamless experience not only in the home, but in complex buildings. We think things like Engage, our Sense Products, NDE, are opening salvos of that, the great capabilities with our SimonsVoss and Milre, but we think a lot more about the customer experience and access and this is where our investments are being made. Jeff Kessler : Okay, great. Yes. Thank you very much. Mike Wagnes : Keith, is there any other question on the line? Operator : Yes, I'm sorry. The next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Dave Petratis : Good morning. David MacGregor : I guess question on Europe. First of all congratulations on achieving that 10% adjusted operating margin you inherited not so great situation and you've accomplished a lot there. I guess the question is where can you take it from here? What are the capital requirements in order to do that and how should we think about the timeline? Dave Petratis : David, as you said, really good progress since the spin, very pleased with the team and reaching the objective we set when we first spun out in the company. As we've talked about previously there aren't any significant step-ups, relative to the margin enhancement going forward. I think what you'll see a basis of our 2018 guidance is continuous improvement. So we'll continue to push price cost equation, continue to drive productivity, lean out manufacturing efficiencies where we can, and those type of thing. So I would look at it from a perspective of just continuous improvement, given our current business profile there in Europe. David MacGregor : You've got a very good free cash flow guide here for 2018 and I'm just wondering as you think about how like it's put to use, does Europe become a more sort of capital intensive part of the model over the next two to three years as you address that profitability growth challenge? Dave Petratis : We like the cash flow of this business. We'll continue to have our priority on growth through acquisition number one. Europe has one of the best playing fields to be able to do that, but our view continues to be global, what are the smart tuck-ins that makes sense. Second would be technology. There is a whole world of digitization that's moving in our industry and will move over the next decade, so look for us in investments there. But clearly, I'd said in Europe, we'd like to continue to move north, continue to move technically, and find targets that can move us with scale, so that's how we think about it. David MacGregor : Okay. Last question for me is just on the investments of the $0.10 guide. I know regionally you started 2017 if memory serves correctly guiding to $0.15 to $0.20. I think you ended the year at about $0.13. Now you're guiding to $0.10. I know you asked about this on an earlier question but in responding to that, David, I think you had noted that a contributing factor here was just management bandwidth. Does that raise a question about management bandwidth here? Do we have to be concerned about your ability to capitalize on opportunities as they present themselves, could you expand a little bit on what you meant there? Dave Petratis : So I think when I think about management bandwidth, the first one is, understanding management capacity. Our ability to efficiently deploy capital, I think after 48 months as a publicly traded company I think we know where our boundaries are. It's easy to spend money; it's not so easy to do it efficiently. We think pretty significant -- we think deeply about that. I think as I step back and think about the technologies and opportunities that we have going forward it's important that we know where to invest, how to invest, but also where we can move the bar through M&A and do it smartly. So I feel good that we know where we're at. But I'm not going to swing the fence or stretch beyond what I think could add risk and potential problems and get a return on that investment. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Robert Barry : Hey, I just wanted to clarify the earlier comment about price cost being a net positive; is that price plus productivity net of all inflation or just some incremental color there? Patrick Shannon : Yes, so that would be our price cost, so pricing would exceed material inflation clearly. Price productivity together would offset any inflation including merit and those normal things that occur in the course of the business. Robert Barry : Got it. And just any color on approximately how big of a net positive that is; is that a material contributor. Patrick Shannon : You'll see it in our 10-K when we file relative to 2017 but fairly significant contributor. Again would anticipate 2018 to continue to be positive probably not to the extent it was in 2017, just given the price realization we got during the course of the year, but again favorable for the full -- anticipated for the full-year of 2018. Robert Barry : Got it. And then, can you just level set us on the tax rate going forward it sounds like we should model 2016 for 2018 but then or should we assume it's rising after that like to a high-teens rate just wanted to clarify? Patrick Shannon : Yes, I think the best way to look at it, again every year has some discrete items that play into the effective tax rate. So you're right 2018 we anticipate 16%. Going forward higher teens is probably a better expectation and I would -- we feel pretty good about that over the long-term. And so as you think about 2019 and beyond, you should think about a little step-up in the rate relative to 2018. Robert Barry : Got it. And then just one last quick one on the cash flow guide the $380 million to $400 million does that include some one-time cash headwinds? I just want to clarify that I feel. Thanks. Patrick Shannon : Yes, it does. We mentioned in the commentary that relative to the tax reform changes there's going to be some one-time cash tax payments in addition to the normal kind of repatriation tax. It is a one-off item specific to 2018. And so that's a little headwind in our cash flow and that's why you don't see quite the conversion ratio on ACF to net earnings, but believe more importantly that 2019 and beyond our stated objective of 100% conversion we should be able to maintain. Robert Barry : Got it. So ex those one-times, you're at or above 100 this year? Patrick Shannon : Yes. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Tim Wojs : Hey guys nice job. Dave Petratis : Thank you, Tim. Tim Wojs : I guess maybe going back to Americas and just -- and just maybe more specifically on margins. Just given I think you exited the year at may be 28.8%. You've got the incremental investments but then you also have I think some dilution from the deal. So what's the right way to think about Americas margins in 2018 versus 2017? Patrick Shannon : So I think the way to think about it is like the other regions of the globe on a base business ex acquisition, continuous improvement, again continue to get pretty good leverage and pull-through margin on incremental volume, positive contribution on price cost inflation etcetera. But the margins on the acquisitions, good businesses, but the margin profile isn't at the 28.8% referenced. And so you're looking at -- when everything is said and done kind of flattish to slightly up margins for 2018 all inclusive of the M&A activity. Tim Wojs : Okay. And that's just for Americas? Patrick Shannon : Yes. Tim Wojs : Okay, great. And then maybe slipping over to the growth the 4% to 5% organically in Americas, what's the right cadence for the year? I think you have a little bit that the comps I think in the first half might be a little bit more difficult than the second half so just may be just level set us on the model around cadence of growth? Thanks. Patrick Shannon : So you're right very difficult comps in Q1 in particular. So I would anticipate maybe the growth rates been slightly lower in Q1 this year relative to last year, but and slightly improving during the course of the year, not that big of a delta during the course of the year but slightly not as high as what you would anticipate for the back half of the year. Tim Wojs : Okay, great. Good luck on 2018 guys. Patrick Shannon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Wolfe Research. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just a follow-up. I guess more broadly on some of the M&A announcements here recently, Dave. I think when you first went out there is a bit of a push to get kind of a focus more on the hardware less on the door and the last few deals have certainly been specialty type products but have included a bit more door-centric stuff; is this a change in philosophy should we expect this to continue within some of these niches or how do you view that assessment because I know that was a big difference between yourselves and your largest competitor there initially? Dave Petratis : So first of all think about it as my own maturity and understanding the business. We think we have a powerful asset and our spec writing capability and when we can come in and write a total turnkey spec especially including specialty equipment and features we think that's a good place to be. We also looked at the competitive landscape and clearly saw where we were disadvantaged particularly around our steel door offerings with steel craft and for example the Republic acquisition that we made last January gives a better geographical capability to serve customers locally. These businesses have laid adaption capabilities and it's really just thinking that through. In the Middle East with QMI we were actually winning jobs and shipping steel craft doors firms Cincinnati Ohio. So it's just I think a refinement of our understanding of the market and the points in capital that we think helps our top-line and bottom-line growth. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Thanks for the color. And then on some of these labor shortages that were impacting last quarter, I mean clearly Americas volume growth accelerated, I guess I don't know exactly what price contributed but probably not much compared to that that bigger number in 3Q; is that a sign of some of those shortages working themselves out? Or is it just, hey, in the fourth quarter where seasonally things are slow and there is a bit more slack in the system, maybe help us understand that dynamic a bit better? Dave Petratis : So as we look back at Q3 especially as we ended it, we saw an absence of flows through the supply chain, as projects are pressured to complete on year-end, we saw that slack move through the system, I think that's going to be something we're going to have to continue to navigate and be aware of as we go in to 2018 and 2019. I see labor constraints as well identified. I mentioned the high backlog of construction orders put in place and we think it will create shock in the market and demand as we go forward. Now with that said, we're not -- we're looking at our value streams and say how can we invest to better position the company, our incentive structures that we can use to help move that through to get better and consistent flows, we\u2019re working on it, but we don\u2019t have it all figured out. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. And then just one last one for Patrick, I apologize for doing this, you probably didn't mean for all this deconstruction of what I'm about to do. So organic or volume-based incremental margins I think net of investments looks like they're about 30% in the guide, if the price cost is positive, I think on a volume only basis you'd probably be somewhere in the mid-20s, that seems conservative to me but is there something on the mix front or something out that we should keep in mind as maybe being an irritant to that again? Like I think that's ex acquisitions or FX I think that's a pure number that I backed into? Patrick Shannon : Yes, so mix maybe a little bit more favorable given the growth in residential relative to the non-residential is weighing on that contribution margin. Other than that there isn\u2019t really any other significant items that would be weighing down that margin percent. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Thank you very much. Maybe just trying to stick to one question, it was really on the electronics business, I think you enjoyed mid-teens growth there in Q4, maybe give us an update on what proportion of your total revenue now is coming from electronics? And also what you\u2019re expecting the growth to be in 2018 and whether you're broadly happy with your organic position and there shouldn\u2019t be a need for a big M&A deal in that segment of the market for you? Patrick Shannon : Yes. So again really good growth in electronics portfolio across both non-residential and residential products really like what we're seeing there. As you know still low penetration particularly in the residential markets, a lot of room to continue to grow there. The overall portfolio in electronics is mid-teens as far as our global business and that varies a little bit by region. But we'd expect the electronics to continue to outgrow the mechanical products, so that percentage will continue to increase. And as we've talked about previously good trend for Allegion, higher price points, similar margin profile means more EBIT dollars. And we will continue to drive that particularly as we look to make investments whether it would be demand creation or new product development to ensure that we can be a leader as far as that development in electromechanical convergence. Operator : Thank you. And since that's all the time we have for questions at the present time. I would like to turn the call to Mike Wagnes for any closing comments. Mike Wagnes : Thanks, Keith. We'd like to thank everyone for participating in today's call. Please contact me for any further questions and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Allegion Q1 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I now would like to turn the conference over to Michael Wagnes, Please go ahead, sir. Mike Wagnes - Allegion Plc : Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for Allegion's first quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we'll refer to in today's call, are available on our website at allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website. Please go to slide number 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Please go to slide number 3. Our release and today's commentary include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of restructuring and acquisition expenses in current year and prior-year results. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior-year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details. Dave and Patrick will discuss our first quarter 2018 results, which will be followed by a Q&A session. For the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and then re-enter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone given the time allotted. Please go to slide number 4. And I'll turn the call over to Dave. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Thanks, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. As you saw in the morning's press release, Allegion got off to a solid start in 2018, delivering double-digit top line growth and earning per share expansion. For the first quarter, revenue was $613 million, an increase of 11.7%, reflecting organic growth of 3.3%. Benefits from acquisitions and foreign currency tailwinds contributed to the top line growth. All regions grew organically. Americas saw organic growth of 2.7% in the quarter against the tough comparable, supported by solid price and high-teens growth in electronics. The Americas business continues to see strong end-market fundamentals, although labor availability continues to impact the timing of the completion of projects and thus causes some choppiness in the timing of orders and shipments. This results in a healthy construction backlog, which we see across the U.S. According to the Associated Builders and Contractors Incorporated, backlogs in the construction channel are at highs for the decade, which we believe leads to a longer cycle. The EMEIA region continues its rebound and delivered robust organic growth of 5.9%, driven by favorability across most products and geographies. Asia-Pacific organic growth was essentially flat, growing 0.2%. Adjusted operating income of $104.2 million increased 2.8% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margins decreased by 150 basis points due to inflationary pressure, incremental investments and expected margin dilution related to our recent acquisitions completed in Q1 2018. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.80 increased $0.07 or 9.6% versus the prior year. Additionally, we are reaffirming our full-year revenue, EPS and available cash flow outlook. Please go to slide 5. Before I turn the call over to Patrick, I want to take a moment to talk about an issue that has surfaced far too often over the past couple of decades, and that is school security. The voice of Allegion's customers continue to be a source of innovation for our teams across the globe. In response to a market need for improved K-12 perimeter security, Von Duprin announced the launch of its new remote locking and monitoring product innovation in February. At ISC West earlier this month, we were honored with the Judges' Choice award for these solutions during the 2018 Security Industry Association New Product Showcase. These latest Von Duprin solutions were designed to enhance perimeter security in K-12 facilities by enabling remote daily lockup, centralized emergency lockdown, and door status monitoring. They are retrofit solutions that expand a school's reach of the electronic access control system to secondary openings that would traditionally go unaddressed because of the cost and complexity of running wires. Without electronic access control, these openings may be left unlocked or propped open, compromising its security and limiting the school's ability to effectively lock down the facility in response to an emergency. We know America's 100,000 K-12 public schools are on average more than 40 years old, many haven't been supplied with the mechanical and technological advancements created to better protect students, teachers and administration. Allegion is working with industry organizations, law enforcement officials, educators, parents and others to drive recognition of school security infrastructure needs among government officials at the state and federal level. Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I'll be back to discuss our full-year 2018 outlook. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. If you would, please go to slide number 6. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the first quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 3.3% organic growth in the first quarter. The modest organic growth reflects strong performance in the EMEIA region across most product and geographic segments, with more modest growth in the Americas due to a tough year-over-year comparable. Pricing was favorable in the quarter in all regions, as the company remains disciplined in taking necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of rising commodity prices and inflation across the supply chain. As a response to the rising commodities (sic) [commodity prices] and inflation, we have accelerated pricing actions in the Americas with a recently announced price increase to take effect in July. With this action, we still anticipate price plus productivity to more than offset inflation for the year. In addition, we are taking other necessary cost containment actions to mitigate the impact of the inflationary headwinds. During the quarter, acquisitions contributed 4.7% growth and foreign currency was a tailwind, particularly in the EMEIA region. Overall, our recently completed acquisitions from the first quarter of 2018 are performing extremely well. They're delivering good top line performance with strong margins and are immediately accretive to adjusted earnings per share. Please go to slide number 7. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $613.1 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 11.7% versus the prior year, up 3.3% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $104.2 million increased 2.8% over the same timeframe from last year. The adjusted operating margin of 17% decreased 150 basis points. The margin decline was driven primarily by inflationary pressures which exceeded price plus productivity. Other headwinds to margin performance were incremental investments, along with unfavorable product and geographic mix. And while our recent acquisitions are dilutive to Allegion margins, as previously anticipated, they were accretive to adjusted earnings per share. Please go to slide number 8. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter 2017, reported EPS was $0.71. Adjusting $0.02 for the prior-year restructuring expenses and integration costs related to acquisitions, the 2017 adjusted EPS was $0.73. The combination of interest expense, other income and non-controlling interest increased EPS by $0.04, driven primarily by the reduced interest expense resulting from the company's debt refinancing that took place at the end of the prior year. Operational results increased EPS by $0.03 as favorable price, operating leverage and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. The EPS increase related to acquisitions and a reduced effective tax rate, which were $0.02 and $0.01 respectively, offset the impact of incremental investments which were a $0.03 reduction. The incremental investments relate to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development, as well as channel strategies. This results in adjusted first quarter 2018 EPS of $0.80 per share, an increase of $0.07 or approximately 10% compared to the prior year. Continuing on, we have a $0.05 per share reduction for acquisition-related and restructuring charges. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at first quarter 2018 reported EPS of $0.75. Please go to slide number 9. First quarter revenues for the Americas region were $439.1 million, up 7.7% on a reported basis and 2.7% organic growth. The organic growth was driven by volume and price as we experienced another strong quarter for electromechanical products, which grew high-teens. The acquisitions of TGP and AD Systems drove 4.7% growth to total reported revenue. The Americas residential business saw mid-single digit growth; and non-residential products, excluding acquisitions, experienced low-single digit growth. Americas' adjusted operating income of $113.5 million increased 4.1% versus the prior-year period, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 90 basis points. The decrease in adjusted operating margin was driven primarily by the dilutive nature of Allegion's recent acquisitions, which was anticipated. Unfavorable product and business mix also contributed to the margin decline. The incremental investment headwind was offset with positive price and productivity in excess of inflation. Please go to slide number 10. First quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $150.3 million, up 26.9% and up 5.9% on an organic basis. The strong organic growth was driven by favorability across most geographies and businesses, with particular strength in the portable security, SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses. The reported revenue increase was boosted by currency tailwinds, along with contributions from the recently acquired QMI business. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $9 million increased 12.5% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 80 basis points, with incremental investment headwinds and commodity inflationary pressures driving a majority of the decrease. Also having an impact were inefficiencies and inflationary pressures related to a strike at our manufacturing location in Turkey. These margin pressures were slightly offset by favorable leverage on incremental volume during the quarter. Please go to slide number 11. First quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $23.7 million, up 3.9% versus the prior year. Organic revenue increased 0.2%, with the flat organic growth driven primarily by project timing. Total revenue was supported by favorable foreign currency impacts. Asia-Pacific adjusted operating loss for the quarter was $1 million, with adjusted operating margins down 680 basis points versus the prior-year period. Unfavorable product and geographic mix, inflationary pressures and incremental investments drove the reduction in income and margin. Please go to slide number 12. Available cash flow for the first quarter was negative $18.8 million, which is an improvement of nearly $30 million compared to the prior-year period. The improvement is driven by the non-recurring $50 million discretionary pension funding payment in Q1 2017, along with higher net earnings in 2018, partially offset by increased working capital and expected higher cash taxes. Working capital as a percent of revenues and the ratio for the cash conversion cycle increased in the first quarter 2018 when compared to the prior-year period. The increase is primarily driven by working capital related to recently acquired businesses. We remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital and will continue to evaluate opportunities to accelerate turnover in order to minimize investments in working capital. Lastly, we are affirming our full-year available cash flow outlook of $380 million to $400 million. I'll now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on the full-year 2018 outlook. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Thank you, Patrick. Please go to slide 13. As noted on the slide, we're affirming the 2018 outlook given during our previous earnings call. We are holding the total revenue outlook for growth at 10.5% to 11.5%, with organic growth at 4% to 5%. Our view of end markets remains favorable across the globe. If we look closer at the Americas business, end-market fundamentals remain solid as we continue to see positive indicators in non-residential verticals and expect momentum in single-family construction to continue to support solid residential markets. However, due to the ongoing constraint across the construction supply chain, including labor, the industry is still experiencing delays in overall project construction, which has an impact on the timing of our revenue and causes choppiness from quarter-to-quarter. Construction backlogs continue to be at record highs. European markets continue to rebound nicely and are being bolstered by general macroeconomic conditions such as high consumer confidence and low unemployment that remain favorable to markets. The GDPs in all key economies are growing and total revenue growth continues to be assisted by FX tailwinds. In the Asia-Pacific region, timing of projects can cause large impacts on growth rates from quarter-to-quarter. Indicators we see in the Asia-Pacific region have not changed from prior outlook. Similar to Europe, FX tailwinds continue to contribute to overall revenue growth. We expect inflationary pressures to continue throughout the year. As such, we have taken actions to mitigate the impacts of inflation and have announced price increases for significant portions of the product portfolio. With these actions, we expect the combination of price-productivity inflation to be a net positive for the year, however, not as much of a tailwind as in the prior year. We are affirming our reported earnings per share outlook of $4.20 to $4.35 and adjusted earnings per share of $4.35 to $4.50. This represents adjusted EPS growth of approximately 10% to 14%. As Patrick just stated, we're also affirming our cash flow outlook of $380 million to $400 million. Included in the outlook is an assumption of the full-year tax rate to be approximately 16% and outstanding diluted shares of approximately 96 million. Please go to slide 14. As a summary, total revenue grew nearly 12%, organic revenue grew just over 3%, acquisitions contributed $26 million in revenue for the quarter. Adjusted operating margins were down 150 basis points, primarily driven by inflationary pressures. However, pricing actions are in place to mitigate. Adjusted EPS saw nearly 10% growth in the quarter. Now, Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. And the first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Maybe just the first question around, you mentioned a couple of times that price and productivity, in excess of inflation, should be a tailwind for the year as a whole, but less than that, sort of 120 bps boost you had last year. Maybe explain a little bit how quickly it turns around. It was minus 50 bps in the first quarter. Do we think it's sort of a slight negative in Q2 and then positive by Q4, that kind of trajectory? Or how quickly do you think it reverses? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yes. So you've got the numbers right relative to the spread. Price-productivity offsetting inflation a little under water this quarter, which sequentially down. And inflationary got out in front of us a little bit more than anticipated, particularly with the rise in the commodity prices. But as we look forward for the balance of the year, as we indicated, full year would expect to be in positive territory. I actually anticipate a big recovery in Q2 relative to Q1, and hopefully be flat to maybe slightly negative would be the expectation, and then that turning more positive as we look in the second half of the year, particularly with the recently announced price increase in Americas, which should drive a big component of that going forward. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. And then my follow-up question would be around the non-residential revenue growth in the Americas region. That was only up I think sort of low-single-digit, but you had the double-digit comp a year ago. Do we anticipate that that Americas non-res piece accelerates in Q2, or it's just too early to tell because of those labor shortages in the construction industry you mentioned? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I think if you look at our business historically, Q2, Q3 accelerates; certainly see nothing to change that. We see markets and lead indicators like our hollow metal sales as a strong lead indicator for that revenue to come. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Saliq Khan with Imperial Capital. Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Good morning. Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC : Hey, guys. Could you kind of talk about some of the things that you had showcased over at ISC West most recently, the new technologies? And what do you anticipate the penetration is going to be of those new solutions that you most recently introduced? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So I think you're talking about the RU innovation of exit device that won the award? Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC : That's right. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : We think that product has great opportunity and it's partly driven by the need for connected K-12 security that can be activated from a central command. There's money flowing in for security for those overall markets. And I hope you have an appreciation of the installed base that we have in those markets today. We do extremely well in K-12 security in both public and private, and we think the desirability to be able to upgrade unprotected doors will drive nice growth in the exit device business. That's extremely profitable for us going forward. Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC : The follow-up on that would be is when do you anticipate the upgrade cycle is going to hit? So rather than just going out there and just selling to new customers or the ones where they have been thinking about security, but it wasn't a prime factor in their decision of being able to make things more automated a lot more easier. But from a historical customer perspective, when do you believe that upgrade cycle come about? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I think we always see this upgrade cycle in Q2, Q3, but this will not be a spike as communities embrace the need for school security and our industry partners with them to propose better solutions. We think that's a growing opportunity for us over the next 5 to 10 years... Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC : Thank you. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : ...complimented by aging infrastructure and the need for more intelligent systems. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning, guys. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Hey, Joe. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Can you maybe talk about just margin expectations just given commodity cost headwinds that you're experiencing right now? Do you think you can grow margins across any of the geographic segments this year? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So I think a way to think about it is, we had highlighted on the last quarter conference call and kind of talked a little bit about full-year expectations. Keep in mind, with the recent acquisitions, although accretive to earnings per share really like what we're seeing there in terms of the growth in those businesses and strong performance, they are dilutive to our overall margin performance. I would say the expectation would be, on an aggregate basis, margins to be kind of flattish for the full year, year-over-year. So that would imply with the dilutive nature of the acquisitions that base business slightly improving, given the volume leverage, the expectations on the organic growth, as well as slight improvement on the price/productivity inflation equation. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. That's helpful, David. Maybe I wanted to follow-up one question on your comment around commercial backlogs being higher than they have been in the last 10 years. How does that then translate into the growth framework for the second half of this year and, even more importantly, into 2019? Does it give you a little bit more visibility from the longer-term perspective? How are you guys thinking about that? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So we're net positive on that. We think it snowplows, it pushes that recovery longer into the cycle. I think it puts a challenge on us to sharpen our game and partner with the projects that will go faster. Second is, driving productivity through the entire value stream. We've introduced digital tools that help architects and our spec writers to drive productivity, and then how we can do more pre-factory install ahead of the job site to take labor off. So we think net positive. And as I have traveled the world, I've been on three continents since the start of the year, I've never been more robust about what I see in terms of construction activity. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's good to hear. Thanks. I'll get back in queue. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Good morning. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hey. Dave, just a follow-up on that point. Makes sense what you're saying about labor, right? We can see it in the unemployment rate and shortage of truck drivers and things like that. But what maybe is a little peculiar is like we're not hearing it, for example, from like the HVAC guys and maybe some of the more skilled trades, for lack of a better term. Is the bottleneck like right at the end at the installation side of the equation, or is it kind of elsewhere in the project flow from a labor standpoint? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : We actually do surveys of the value stream to try and get a sense. And whether its architects, wholesale distributors, contract distributors, locksmiths, if they had more labor capability prepared, they could grow their businesses; one. Number two is, I see the numbers coming out of Lennox and Trane. I think I would put out the hypothesis that, during the downturn, those skills held better than some of the more general skills. I think some of that general labor went to other parts of the economy and to rebuild that back, I think, is a challenge. In particular, electricians, millwrights, ironworkers are in tight supply and it's a headwind that we'll face across construction going forward. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Makes sense. And can you just remind us how big your educational business is as a percent of the total company? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : So, Jeff, if you think of our non-res business, right, in the Americas, non-res is about 70% of Americas. And of that non-res business, about 60% is institutional markets. We don't disclose educational markets, but institutional is probably 60% of the non-res in the Americas. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I would just add. Next time you go on a college campus in a K-12 school, our position there is extremely strong. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yeah. I know it is. I'll be looking for you on Villanova campus next month at graduation. How about that? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : And you know what, we're there. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Right. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Morning, Tim. Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. So, maybe just sort of back on the labor question. Just as you kind of think about the projects converting today or maybe you call it a conversion cycle or quote to order or something, but what does that kind of timeline look like today versus what you might consider normal? Is it a couple months, is it six months, is it a year? Just trying to kind of think about how some of the projects are kind of being pushed out and the timing around it. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I think you've got to go to those reports out of Associated Construction. You see about a three to four-month swell. What I'd say normal backlog, let's say five months to six months is now 10 months. That's how I'd describe that. Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Okay. And then maybe just bigger picture. Within electronics growth, over the last kind of 12 to 18 months, have you seen any change in the balance or mix between the residential business and the commercial business within that electronics growth rate that you disclosed? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Resi is growing faster. It's because of some of the new entrants. I think when potential customers evaluate our products, I think we've got some excellent solutions out there. And the overall awareness, whether it's last mile, Amazon Key, millennials moving up, it's put upward momentum. We believe \u2013 if you went back to Analyst Day, we'd say the market 4% to 8% growth on resi and it's on the high side, and we're doing better than that. Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Good luck on the rest of the year. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning. On the mix of residential growing faster than non-res, that was some of the headwind in the quarter are the right takeaway? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah. That's correct. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then on institutional, Dave, can you just comment about what you're seeing on institutional projects? I know education got asked earlier. Just that tends to be I think a little bit higher margin for you. What's kind of the flow through? And is the labor constraints more relegated to that end market or how should we think about that? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I would characterize this Q2, Q3 are our best opportunity in institutional. The activity there is setting up to be solid for us. What we see, when I was up in the Northeast, is conversions to electronics and in our commercial institutional type products. That segment of the market, you've got a window of time on a college campus or a K-12, and those contractors tend to be maybe at a higher level of sophistication than just a commercial building, and that's a general. But you've got to get that done in a tight timeframe and they tend to push those projects through. That gives us volume in Q2 and Q3. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : And I'll just add. With the anticipated improvement in those end markets, it is a favorable product mix for us because the suite of products is more Von Duprin, LCN, Schlage collectively together, and being the leading market provider here in the U.S., that's a good trend for us. I do have another... Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So is that growing faster? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Go ahead. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Is that growing faster than the other parts of non-res for you for this year? Is that the anticipation? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Essentially same across all verticals, maybe a little bit improvement relative to the prior year. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yes. Good morning, everyone. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Morning. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Good morning. You referred to previous 2018 guide, which I appreciate, but I noticed you left out kind of the regional breakout slide from the deck. Any change in the composition of that guide by region? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : So, historically, we don't provide kind of the regional guide in terms of margin, that type of thing. The revenue guide, if that's what you're referring to, is the same in terms of what we gave last quarter and, collectively, organic growth of 4% to 5% across the board and that varies of course by region. But our revenue guide across the regions and in total has not changed from when we were together last quarter. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Thanks for covering that. And then, secondly, just the price increases. Can you just talk about what percentage of the overall portfolio will be favorably influenced by these increases? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : So we are looking at improving our price position across the globe. We have better ability to get higher pricing probably here in the Americas. So that being, say, 70% of our portfolio, it would apply predominantly to Americas. And we've been a little bit more aggressive there in terms of the price actions. As indicated, we've already announced to the field a price increase on non-residential products beginning July this year. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : And I guess just how confident are you in your ability to take pricing in the residential space? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : It's our biggest headwind. We certainly got a big exposure at big box, and the opening price point part of that portfolio is under pressure. So it's a challenge there. We're going to work hard to try and get some price realization there. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Thanks. Good luck. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Robert Barry of Susquehanna. Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Good morning, Rob. Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Just wanted to understand a little bit better what was going on with the margin dynamic in EMEIA. I mean, you were able to offset inflation in Americas, but not in EMEIA. Curious about the impact since the Turkey strike, is that's still ongoing or is that done? And just in general, I mean do you still think you can grow the margins there this year. I think it was a 50 to a 100 basis point expectation? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah. So the strike in Turkey has been completed. So we've reached conclusion and agreement. The impact there, there was a retrospective adjustment and an ongoing impact, if you will. And so, we had the flow through of the retrospective adjustment on margins. If you were to kind of pro forma that out, you'd have margins pretty much equal to maybe slightly better than the prior year. So, going forward, we still believe we can see some margins to be slightly up year-over-year. I like what we're seeing in the business, particularly in the volume growth. Electronics business is growing extremely well. And so, we like what we're seeing there from a top line perspective and would expect for the full year, as we had indicated at the beginning of the year, for margins to be slightly up even with this impact of the strike that we incurred in this quarter. Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got it, got it. And then maybe just as a follow-up, I wanted to just touch on what you said in answer to the earlier question on the pricing, especially in the U.S. with the big box partners. I mean, I know those conversations are never easy, but just given the inflation is so apparent now, I mean is it just more of a given that there will need to be pricing and are you getting that? And in particular, if you could also just touch on, you mentioned pricing pressure in the opening price point. That's spilling over also into where you'd play, I think you're more in the middle and higher end. Thank you. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So there's never been a better opportunity to go have those tough discussions with big box. It's hand-to-hand combat. But the table is set. Inflationary forces at work. It's good for them, it's good for us. Our portfolio is not well-positioned in retail around opening price point. We certainly have offerings, but our electronics \u2013 our Schlage Champagne brand products are the replacement product of choice, and we position there consciously. And customers today are choosing that opening price point more than we would like. When those products fail, we like the replacement part of it, but it's one of the challenges we have with the portfolio. Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : And maybe pulling some volume out of the base price point, if that's... David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Correct. Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : Thank you. At the recent ISC West Conference, congratulations, you guys win a fairly big prize for what could be in my opinion a very high volume type of a door closer. And I'm wondering if you could comment on your ability to take essentially what was a mechanical product, put some electronics into it, and have a product that could still be mass produced for a lot of different types of institutions. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : So a couple things I like about that product, Jeff, is it's got several patents that I think are unique to the industry and that product. Number two, I think you're aware of the large installed base that we've got. In an environment where there's a need and demand for better school security and connectivity, we think that products got outstanding opportunities. I was at our Von Duprin factory yesterday and extremely confident in our ability to produce a high-quality product that we're known for and meet the demands of the marketplace. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : How fast can you get that into the market? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : It's really as we roll forward, this next couple of quarters important. We have a unique relationship through our field offices and our service partners to work with those schools and I think it will move through very quickly. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : Okay. And finally, just as a quick comment, I was on the ASSA ABLOY call this morning and they talked about the Americas being the single most, the big pain point for both commodity inflation and trying to work with customers to try to get the pricing back up. They said there was a lot of resistance at the beginning. They are beginning to get it now. So I would assume that the same thing it begins to apply to you folks. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : I think we are in a better position as a price leader here. I think we've always worked extremely hard to get the value that our specification and products demand. You certainly see a bit of a headwind in this quarter for us, but it's more \u2013 anytime you slam tariffs down, our suppliers certainly take that opportunity. Demand is high, but I like our position to be able to get the price that we deserve in the marketplace, Jeff. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : Okay. Okay. Thank you very much. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And as there are no more questions at the present time, I would like to return the call to Mike Wagnes for any closing comments. Mike Wagnes - Allegion Plc : We'd like to thank everyone for participating on today's call. Please contact me for any further questions and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note that today's event is being recorded. Now, I'd like to turn the conference over to Michael Wagnes. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Wagnes - Allegion Plc : Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for Allegion's second quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and the presentation which we'll refer to in today's call are available on our website at allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website. Please go to slide number 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Please go to slide number 3. Our release and today's commentary include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of restructuring and acquisition expenses in current year and prior-year results. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior-year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details. Dave and Patrick will discuss our second quarter 2018 results, which will be followed by a Q&A session. For the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and then re-enter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone given the time allotted. Please go to slide 4, and I'll turn the call over Dave. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Thank you, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I want to start the call with some highlights from the second quarter. Allegion saw a strong top line revenue growth in the second quarter led by the Americas region, which saw solid volumes in both the non-residential and residential businesses as end market fundamentals continue to be solid. Pricing was good in both the Americas and European regions. Acquisitions are contributing nicely to the total company revenue expansion, and global electronics growth continues to be strong, which we see as a long-term trend. In the quarter, we experienced slight margin declines as acquisitions were diluted as expected. Excluding the acquisitions, adjusted operating margins were flat year-over-year as all three regions saw continued inflationary pressures. I'm very pleased with our ability to manage those inflationary forces and maintain organic margins through both pricing and cost actions, once again leading the industry. In the second quarter, we delivered double-digit adjusted EPS growth, driven by operational performance and accretive acquisitions. The EPS performance highlights our continued focus on driving increased shareholder value. Cash flow continues to be solid and increased year-over-year even after excluding the impact of the discretionary pension payment made last year. Please go to slide 5, and I'll walk you through the second quarter financial summary. As you saw in the morning's press release, revenue for the second quarter was $704.7 million, an increase of 12.4%, reflecting organic growth of 5.2%. Benefits from acquisitions and foreign currency tailwinds also contributed to top line growth. All regions grew organically. The Americas led the way with organic growth of 6.6% in the quarter, supported by solid volume in both non-residential and residential businesses. High-teens growth in electronics and favorable price. The EMEIA region saw organic growth of 1.4% against the tough comparable. And Asia Pacific, organic growth came in at 0.7%. Adjusted operating income of $150 million (sic) [$150.1 million] increased nearly 10% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin decreased by 50 basis points due to continued inflationary pressures, incremental investments, and expected margin dilution related to our recent acquisitions. Excluding the impact of the recent acquisitions, the base business operating margins were flat year-over-year, while EBITDA margins increased. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.25 increased $0.14 or approximately 13% versus the prior year. Additionally, we are updating our revenue and EPS outlooks. Full year reported revenue growth outlook is 12.5% to 13.5% and includes the recent acquisitions of GWA Door & Access business and ISONAS. Organic growth remains at 4% to 5%. Reported EPS outlook is now at $4.15 to $4.35 per share with adjusted full EPS outlook remaining at $4.35 to $4.50 per share, reflecting growth of approximately 10% to 14%. Please go to slide 6. Before I turn the call over to Patrick, I want to discuss our recent acquisitions of GWA's Door & Access business and ISONAS, both of which closed in July. The strategic acquisition of GWA Door & Access business including the renowned Australian brand, Gainsborough Hardware, bolstered Allegion's presence in Australia and significantly increases our scale in the Asia Pacific region. With this addition, we're enhancing our residential presence with market-leading positions and long-standing customer relationships, while accelerating our development of electronic security solutions. This is consistent with Allegion's growth strategy in the region and highly complementary to our core business. The acquisition also provides us increased distribution and allows for both revenue and cost synergies when combined with our existing business in Australia. In the Americas, the addition of ISONAS brings a strong pipeline of innovation that will benefit from Allegion's expertise in safety and security as well as our extensive market presence. ISONAS has edge-computing technology that provides innovative access control solutions for non-residential markets and will expand our intellectual property in this segment. ISONAS intelligent devices, like its popular integrated reader-controllers, utilizing power over Ethernet, making them easy to install and cost-effective for customers. Both of these newest additions to the Allegion family expand our core product portfolio, while accelerating electronic adaptation across the industry. We're confident in our ability to further expand the reach of their products and technology as well as increase their capacity for growth to drive shareholder value. Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2018 outlook. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. If you would, please go to slide number 7. The slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the second quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 5.2% organic growth in the second quarter. The solid organic growth reflects strong performance in the Americas region, which saw solid volumes in both the non-residential and residential businesses, and high-teens growth in electronic products. Pricing was favorable in the quarter as the company remains disciplined in taking necessary actions to help mitigate the impact of continued inflationary pressures. Second quarter price realization was strong in our Americas non-residential and EMEIA businesses, but were partially offset by price-related reductions associated with the highly competitive mechanical market segment of our Americas residential retail business. We expect price realization to improve slightly in the back half of 2018 due to the Americas non-residential price increase that went into effect in July. During the quarter, acquisitions contributed 5.4% growth and foreign currency was a tailwind, particularly in the EMEIA region. Please go to slide number 8. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $704.7 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 12.4% versus the prior year, up 5.2% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $150.1 million increased nearly 10% over the same timeframe from last year. Adjusted operating margin of 21.3% decreased 50 basis points, primarily due to the dilutive nature of the recent acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, adjusted operating margins on the base business were flat year-over-year. Inflationary pressures slightly exceeded price plus productivity, less than $1 million, as we are taking other necessary cost containment actions to drive productivity to mitigate the impact of inflationary headwinds. Other headwinds to margin performance were incremental investments, which had a 70-basis-point impact on adjusted operating margins. And while our recent acquisitions were dilutive to Allegion margins, as previously anticipated, they were accretive to adjusted earnings per share. Overall, our recently completed acquisitions from the first half of 2018 are performing well. They are delivering good top line performance with expected margins and, in aggregate, are immediately accretive to adjusted earnings per share. Please go to slide number 9. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter 2017, reported earnings per share was $1.10. Adjusting $0.01 for the prior-year restructuring expenses and integration cost-related acquisitions, the 2017 adjusted earnings per share was $1.11. Operational results increased EPS by $0.13 as favorable price, strong operating leverage and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. Acquisitions contributed $0.03 in the quarter. The combination of interest expense, other income, non-controlling interest, and tax expense increased earnings per share by $0.02, with favorability from interest offset by the prior-year gain on the sale of an equity investment. Moving on, the impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.04 reduction. The incremental investments relate to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel strategies as well as demand creation spending to take advantage of acceleration in the residential electronics market. These incremental investments have continued to enhance growth and are providing solid returns on investment. This results in adjusted first (sic) [second] quarter 2018 EPS of $1.25 per share, an increase of $0.14 or approximately 13% compared to the prior year. Continuing on, we have a $0.06 per share reduction for acquisition-related and restructuring charges. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at the second quarter 2018 reported earnings per share of $1.19. Please go to slide number 10. Second quarter revenues for the Americas region were $526.8 million, up 12.4% on a reported basis and 6.6% organically. The organic growth was driven by solid volume in both non-residential and residential products. The non-residential business grew high-single digits excluding acquisitions. Residential experienced mid-single digit growth. Pricing was strong in non-residential, but was partially offset by pressures in residential retail pricing, particularly on our mechanical portfolio. The TGP and AD Systems acquisitions added 5.6% growth to total revenue. We also experienced another strong quarter for electromechanical products, which grew high-teens. Similar to last year, we announced a price increase to go into effect in early Q3. As a result, the year-over-year impact related to customer-accelerated purchases in advance of the increase are comparable. Americas' adjusted operating income of $155.8 million increased 9.9% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 70 basis points. The decrease in adjusted operating margin was driven by the dilutive nature of Allegion's recent acquisitions, which was expected. Excluding acquisitions, adjusted operating margins on the base business were up slightly year-over-year as favorable product and business mix were able to overcome the impact of high inflation, which exceeded price and productivity in the quarter. The incremental investment headwind was offset with positive volume leverage. Please go to slide number 11. Second quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $147.8 million, up 14.4% and up 1.4% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by solid pricing for the quarter. A tough comparable in the quarter caused the year-over-year volume growth to be a bit muted as markets remained mostly favorable. The reported revenue increase was boosted by currency tailwinds along with contributions from the recently acquired QMI business. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $12.1 million increased 34.4% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 120 basis points, with price and productivity more than offsetting inflation and incremental investments. The EMEIA region also saw adjusted operating margin dilution from its acquisitions. Please go to slide number 12. Second quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $30.1 million, up 3.1% versus the prior year. Organic revenue increased 0.7%. Total revenue was supported by favorable foreign currency impacts. Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $0.8 million, with adjusted operating margins down 520 basis points versus the prior-year period. The Asia Pacific region saw continued inflationary pressures, outweigh price and productivity. Unfavorable product and geographic mix as well as incremental investments further drove reductions in income and margin. As a result, we have commenced planned restructuring actions late in the second quarter, which will drive operational improvements in the second half of the year and align to our overall regional strategy. Please go to slide number 13. Year-to-date, available cash flow for the second quarter 2018 was $97.8 million, which is an increase of $55.2 million compared to the prior year period. The increase is driven by the non-recurring $50 million discretionary pension funding payment that was made in the first quarter of 2017, along with higher net earnings, partially offset by higher working capital acquirements. Working capital as a percent of revenues and the ratio for the cash conversion cycle increased in the second quarter 2018 when compared to the prior year period. The increase is primarily driven by working capital related to recently acquired businesses. We remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to minimize investments and working capital. Lastly, we are affirming our full year available cash flow outlook of $380 million to $400 million. I'll now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2018 outlook. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Thank you, Patrick. Please go to slide 14. As noted on the slide, given performance during the first half and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are raising total and organic revenue growth in the Americas and tightening the range for both total and organic revenue growth in Europe. In addition, we are raising total revenue growth for Asia Pacific, reflecting the recent acquisition of GWA's Door & Access business in Australia, while taking down organic revenue growth in Asia Pacific, reflecting first half performance. This results in the consolidated outlook for total revenue increasing to a range of 12.5% to 13.5% and organic revenue remaining at a range of 4% to 5%. If we look closer at the Americas business, end market fundamentals remain solid. We see positive indicators in non-residential verticals and stable demand in single-family construction, combined with vigorous demand for residential electronic products. As I have mentioned in previous quarters, we continue to experience constraints across the construction supply chain, which causes delays in overall project construction. These delays can have an impact on the timing of our revenue and can cause some choppiness from quarter-to-quarter. European market indicators remain positive and continue to be bolstered by general macroeconomic conditions such as high consumer confidence and low unemployment that remain favorable to markets. The GDP in our key economies are growing, and total revenue growth continues to be assisted by FX tailwinds. In the Asia Pacific region, timing of projects can cause large impacts on growth rates from quarter-to-quarter. Similar to EMEIA, FX tailwinds continue to contribute to overall revenue growth. The large increase in total revenue outlook for Asia Pacific is to account for the acquired GWA Door & Access business. We expect inflationary pressures to continue throughout the year. As stated in the first quarter earnings call, we have taken actions to mitigate the impacts of inflation. The pricing increases announced last quarter for the Americas went into effect earlier in July. We're updating our reported earnings per share outlook of $4.15 to $4.35 and affirm adjusted earnings per share of $4.35 to $4.50. This represents adjusted EPS growth of approximately 10% to 14%. As Patrick just stated, we're also affirming our cash flow outlook of $380 million to $400 million. Along with the revenue impacts of the recently acquired businesses, the EPS outlook also includes the acquisitions. Also included in the outlook is the assumption for investment spend of approximately $0.15 per share, which is an increase of $0.05 per share from our previous outlook. The increased investment spend represents an increase in our new product development and demand creation activities primarily for electronic products in the Americas to further accelerate growth, supported by our high-teens growth year-to-year. The outlook also assumes the full year tax rate to be approximately 15% to 16%, with the second half rate higher than the 14.8% adjusted tax rate experienced in the first half of 2018. Outstanding diluted shares included in the outlook are approximately 96 million. Please go to slide 15. In summary, Allegion total revenue grew more than 12%. Organic revenue grew just over 5%. Adjusted operating margins were down 50 basis points and were flat when excluding the impacts of acquisitions. Adjusted EPS saw nearly 13% growth in the quarter. Full year total revenue growth outlook increased to 12.5% to 13.5%, inclusive of the recent announced acquisitions. Full year organic revenue remains at 4% to 5%. Full year reported EPS outlook updated to $4.15 to $4.35 per share. Full year adjusted EPS held at $4.35 to $4.50. Now, Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And this morning's first question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Maybe my first question out, the Americas organic growth turned out to be a little bit better than we expected this quarter. And I'm just wondering, did you guys get any sense on whether there was any pull-forward demand from your pricing actions that took place in July? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I would say it's comparable from what we saw a year ago. I think you can always expect some pull-through because of pricing actions. But as we ended the quarter and extend into the early weeks of July, demand remains strong. We particularly like the activity in the institutional space and feel good about demand through the balance of the year. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful, Dave. And maybe if I were to kind of shift gears a little bit and just talk about the inflationary pressures that you're feeling. So, obviously, putting through a nice price increase in July. I'm just curious whether you expect both price and productivity to offset inflation in the second half of the year. I may have missed that earlier. And then, I have a follow-on on that just to \u2013 I want to dig into Americas a little bit. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Yeah. So, Joe, as we indicated in the second quarter as well as year-to-date, a little bit underwater, not significantly when you look at that equation in terms of price productivity offsetting inflation. Our expectation given the price increase that goes into full effect this quarter is that pricing will improve sequentially in the second half compared to the first half. We're going to continue to drive productivity-contained costs and those type of actions. And so, we would expect in the second half that we'll be favorable on that equation in terms of price and productivity offsetting inflation. Inflation is expected to be a little bit higher than what we anticipated. So we're going to be driving price and productivity harder to help mitigate that going forward. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then just following on on the Americas side, you mentioned earlier in your comments around resi mechanical being competitive. Can you just give us an update to size that business for us today? And then, any color that you can give us around the competitive pressure you see in that business? That would be helpful. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So think total U.S. res about $400 million. I would say our position in that market is strongly influenced by the retrofit. In new construction, especially the surge in multi-family, it's been led by opening price point. It's an extremely competitive part of the business. Our position is really in the retrofit and the growth in the electronics, and it yields one of the more profitable segments in that residential space compared to competitors. I'll say it another way. We make more margin on the sale of a residential lock than anybody else in the space. We've got excellent share and aren't aggressively looking to go position ourselves on that opening price point, which is an important space. But at the end of the day, we want to maximize the returns, so we play the game a little differently. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Understood. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Josh Chan with Baird. Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning, Dave, Patrick, Mike. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Good morning. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Hey. Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning, all. Thanks for the color on the residential side. I want to switch to the non-res side. So with your price increase in Q3, are you seeing kind of competitors follow and do you expect that increase to be realized to the extent that normally would? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So we've seen our major global competitors fall in line. I think you've heard us talk that this industry is disciplined. I would describe Allegion as \u2013 led the way in terms of our price announcements, I think movement on discounts, and I think it reflected in our results versus the competitors. So, I think there'll be good price discipline and almost required with the amount of inflation this industry has seen over the last year. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : And I would just add that the price realization in the commercial segment has continued to be strong. And you go out with a total list price increase. You don't always get that. There's always going to be some discounts relative to that top line number, but that's just to remain competitive in the marketplace. But so far, we've been getting really good price realization in the commercial segment and would expect that to continue, particularly with the recently announced price increase that went into effect at the beginning of this quarter. Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then on the mix side of things, could you talk about how your premium brands are growing relative to sort of our your mid-price point brands? And if you can throw in anything that you're seeing on the import side that could sort of influence the mix equation, more color on that would be great. Thanks. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Our premium brands performed well in the first half. Remember too that we've got initiatives through things like Pro Express to grow those price sliding brands and I think that's predictable. But the strength of our Von Duprin, Schlage and LCN brands are noteworthy in the first half. We have solid growth across the entire portfolio. You're aware of our channel led discretionary business which has \u2013 we introduced some lower price point products. Those are performing extremely well as well. So, we're getting good growth from those, which will be at the lower end. But no real mix issues within the commercial portfolio of products. Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, the last question from me is nice to see the Americas organic growth move higher. It looks like that in the first half you're already growing at that pace and the comps get easier in the second half if I'm not mistaken. So, is there some possibility that you could maybe do a little bit better than the range given sort of the easier comps? How are you thinking about that in the second half? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : So, you noted that we did increase the organic growth outlook for Americas specifically given the Q2 performance. And if you just kind of work the math, you would expect a little bit higher perhaps organic growth back half of the year relative to the first half. And so as Dave indicated earlier, like the demand that we're seeing in the end markets continues to remain real positive and we'll kind of continue to see how the market evolves in the second half of the year, but like what we've seen so far. Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: All right. Great. Good luck in the second half. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Thank you, Josh. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Good morning, Rich. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, so on the residential price, one of your competitors had some fulfillment issues back in Q1; seem to be a little less willing to push their price. Is that kind of the factor here on the residential side or how much of the \u2013 how would you split that between structural issues with imports and I know you just went through where you play, but just curious on the go forward basis as we think out longer term, the dynamics here in residential. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I think our large competitor reported this morning, looks like that's behind them. Their ERP challenges, you'd have to think there'll be some movement there. It's difficult in the big box space. So I'd drive it at that. Any price realization in that part of the market would be welcome. So think a little bit about that. We play in a unique space. In the residential retail, really like our electronics position. We're going to make some investments in the second half that we think will grow demand, product enhancements that will improve capability with some of the communication protocols that are solid products. And it's a little bit different positioning just in the lower part of the market. So, we think that market will continue to be active, especially around the retrofit, and it will reward us. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah. Rich, I would just add a little bit more color. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : The commentary on some of the price pressure on our residential mechanical portfolio, really, around discounts, not the price to the retailers or new home construction builders but more on the discount. So, a little bit higher than anticipated rebates, returns, promotional discounts, those type of things, which, quite frankly, can vary a lot quarter-to-quarter. There's peaks and troughs. You've heard us mentioned this previously on past quarters. And going forward, we don't \u2013 hopefully, we're not anticipating that type of activity that we saw in quarter two. So, it really depends on activity specific, big box retailers and those type of things. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So, is it fair to say that you feel more insulated from import competition in the residential market, in general? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Restate that again? It broke up. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Is it fair to say that you feel more insulated from import offshore competition in the residential market because you don't play at the very low end? Is that a fair statement or how would you characterize the import competition, not talking about some of the larger guys? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So, I do believe we're better insulated. I think we've got a superior supply chain. As I think about the residential market \u2013 as I think about the commercial institutional markets, opening price point, mid-price point, we got a better engine. And you start throwing in things like tariffs, there's importers that are going to have some challenges. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then a real quick one. Just, Patrick, as we think about second half of the year, I mean your seasonality has bounced around a bit from Q3 to Q4 in terms of full year earnings contribution, is there any color you can provide us on how we should think about the balance of Q3 and Q4 within the EPS guidance? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : So, we don't give quarterly guidance, Rich. I think you're aware of that. But the seasonality itself doesn't really change in terms of top line relative to prior periods, if you look at the percentage of the full year. So, I would look at that. What I will provide is as we think about margins going forward, we indicated base business flat in Q2, still under water on a year-to-date basis, but that side of the business improving in the second half, so that for the full year, you're kind of on a flattish type of organic base business, excluding acquisitions from a margin standpoint. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Just sticking I guess, to the two-question rule. The first one is really on the acquisitions. Those are about a 50 bps drag to adjusted margins in Q2. What are you dialing in for the second half for that margin headwind globally? And related to that, is there any color you could give on the organic growth or base margin profile of the very recent or most recent acquisitions? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : So, I would characterize \u2013 so you're right, 50 basis points headwind on margins, given the acquisitions. And I'll just reiterate that the acquisitions themselves are performing to plan, and just given the profile of the business, lower than our industry leading EBIT and EBITDA margins. And so consequently, they do collectively have an impact on our aggregate margins. Going forward, for the second half of the year, without getting into too much detail, you would expect a similar type of drag on the margins in the second half. And one of the issues going forward \u2013 not issue, but just kind of the tyranny of the math, if you will, on the Gainsborough acquisition, has a lower margin profile than even the acquisitions announced earlier in the year. And so that's going to have a \u2013 weigh a little bit more heavily in terms of the dilution on the overall margin profile. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. And then, my follow-up would be, I think you've talked a lot about the Americas region already, so maybe switching to Asia. Just give us a broader update on what's happening there. You took down the organic sales guide, but you're also doing a restructuring and throwing on a large acquisition. So there's a lot, I guess, to handle for that local management team. Just maybe sort of walk us through how you're thinking about the strategy in Asia right now. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So, there is a transformation led by Jeff Wood who was sent to the region last year. He's put a plan together and he's executing on that plan. His OI was a little weaker in the first half. That was driven by strong project activity in the previous year. We really did well in the Macau region with the casino build outs. Those were good margin projects that can't be replaced. But the broader repositioning in that region is to more effectively position Allegion in the growth of electronics, and we like what we see there. And it's a little bit of a high wire act as we transform the year, but they're going to improve in the second half. And I think with the addition of Gainsborough and the other acquisitions that we've made, we're in a good position to move in coordination with the strategic plan over the next few years. You step back even 24 months ago, got out of \u2013 or got out of... Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Bocom. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : ...Bocom, we've got a clear driver to lower our cost structure and position the company that \u2013 in the end-markets that line up better with our strengths. And they're doing a good job with that. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Hey, Andrew. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hopefully I can count to two, because some people certainly have issues with that. So... David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Well I'm going to leave that up to you, Andrew. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So question one, do you guys \u2013 I'm looking actually \u2013 one of my colleagues pointed out that in homebuilding channel, people have inflationary pressures this quarter. We've seen something similar with Pentair in their retail channel. Do you think, in an inflationary environment there is a structural difference between selling to institutions and selling to individuals, and somehow you have to adjust your pricing strategy to differentiate between these two channels? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I think the channels are different. We're competing on different product attributes and when you take one of our institutional products like a Von Duprin exit device, a LCN closer, the duty cycle that that delivers over its lifecycle is different and commands a higher premium than a residential door handle that needs to operate maybe for the cycle of ownership, which is seven years or less. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Right. And any sort of structural adjustments that you need to make in retail channels to adjust for that in an inflationary environment? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I think we always need to try and position ourselves for the pressures of inflation. We also have to be cognizant of our position. If you go into the retail, you'll typically see our brands are in the premium section. And as competition enters, we've got to be sensitive that we don't price ourselves out of the marketplace. There is a point obtained. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : A follow-up question. You guys were able to sort of beat up on your competition over the past couple of years. The company in Northern Europe has been somewhat distracted. Another company was merging. Do you feel \u2013 as I sort of look at this big box pressure, what's happening in Asia, do you think part of what's happening is just those guys getting their act together and just sort of payback for you beating up on them for so many years? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I think electronics, the growth of the access through electronics brings new entrants and to me the behaviors are predictable. I think we have navigated that pretty well with suspect \u2013 with commentary on the retail. Globally, I would say that we have done a good job executing our strategy with the opportunities that we have and the performance of the business, and our performance says that. I think... Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : You can continue to execute globally, right? You think the strategies, the playbook still works? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I believe it still works. I really like our opportunities around access and electronics. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Terrific. Thanks a lot. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I'll give you a second answer there, Andrew. I really like our opportunities around access and electronics. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Terrific. Operator : Okay. Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeffrey Kessler with Imperial. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : Thank you. At the last tradeshow that we saw you folks, I believe, was ESX, you came out, well, you actually reintroduced an electronic \u2013 I just want to call it a wireless door closer. And it seems to me that that was one of, if not, the real highlights of that entire show. So, the question to you is, given the fact that you do a lot of work with the channel, a lot of work with specifiers, people like that, where is \u2013 if you want to call it, where is the ecosystem in building security at this point with regard to accepting some of these new products that you've come out with over the last six months that seem to have the type of potential that your SMB-level door locks had? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Jeff, I think the product is the RURN (00:45:17). Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : Yes. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : It's a nice innovation. Our acquisition of ISONAS builds along those types of things. Our increased investment in the second half and as we go into 2019, we think the adoption of electronic access control is in its infancy. And we believe that Allegion is in a great position to drive seamless access across our customers. We think we can simplify and improve the user experience. We think we can improve security. And we're going to be aggressive to go out and help our customers, architects and end users, integrators to adopt that. We have continued to develop a very strong value proposition that we think will enhance the customer experience. So, in its infancy with great opportunities. I want to say one more thing. I couldn't be more pleased with our global electronic growth. We characterize that as high teens. In the fastest moving markets, we think that half of that in terms of overall market growth. And it's going to continue to be a priority for our company. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : Okay. Along those lines, my follow-up question, which is question number two is, over in Europe, can you describe the ability \u2013 what you're doing in electronics, particularly through influencers like SimonsVoss to bring, again, greater awareness to the channels in Europe, even though they're a bit different, to start accepting electronics and access control that have electronics in them, and start building up a base in that electronics area that can begin to mirror what you're doing over here? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So, the European market moves a little bit slower, part of it's the complexity of that market from a mechanical standpoint. SimonsVoss continues to be a great capital deployment, really pleased with that advancement. I think something that may not have caught your attention is our investment in Nuki, which is important on the residential side of it. But look at Allegion to focus on some key verticals to bring our electronic, our mechanical capability together, to bring end-to-end solutions that we think will help us grow. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : Okay, great. Thank you very much. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good day, everyone. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Good morning. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hey. Two from me also. There's been a little bit of chatter out there that there's been kind of a pickup in import competition in the commercial stock and flow business. And folks like yourself getting spec'd in on projects, but then budgets get tight and push comes to shove and some of the lower-end stuff is actually sneaking into the jobs. To what degree are you seeing that? Is Falcon your response to that? And just wondering if the pricing actually is getting a little bit messier in the commercial market. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I think any time you've got development projects that are on the margins of returns as a developer, they're going to \u2013 when you see inflationary pressures that we've seen, they'll go back and sharpen their pencils. That typically results in, what we call, value engineering. And we think our Falcon and Dexter brands that we've been working on over the last couple of years give us the ability to stay in the hunt. This is an area of the business, when we created Allegion five years ago, that we would just fold our tent. So, we think we've developed the capability. There's always going to be projects like that. And yes, it's happening in the marketplace. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And then second question, unrelated. The inflationary pressures at one level are quite obvious, but then we're also looking at brass, i.e., copper and zinc kind of falling out of bed here in the last couple of months. Can you just give us some sense of where your key inflationary pressures are now? Is it freight, is it coming through in labor, or is it still really kind of the metals complex? But I think Patrick said things are actually getting sequentially worse. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah. So, if you look at the components of our inflation, a big piece of it is steel-related and that would not only be the raw material component but stampings, castings, those type of things that come through the broader supply chain. If you look at the cost on a per pound basis, it really hasn't changed since when we talked 90 days ago, whereas, as you mentioned, the zinc, brass, aluminum, et cetera, has come down. So hopefully, we get some relief going forward on that part of the equation, but it's really steel. And then as you mentioned, freights, packaging, those type of things, ancillary type of costs in our supply chain has increased higher than what we had originally anticipated. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yes. Good morning, everyone. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Good morning, David. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : And David, congratulations on a good quarter. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Thank you. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Great job. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I think I'm proud of the team and \u2013 it's meeting the challenge of these inflationary headwinds. Pretty formidable. Throwing some chairs on top of that. I think we performed well. And it says a lot about the character of Allegion that we're going to defend the profitability of our business. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yeah. I mean, your performance on managing inflation really stands out versus so many other companies on my coverage list this quarter. So congrats there. I want to just go back because you've made a few different comments today around the commercial business. And Patrick started off by talking about the fact that you're getting price traction there. And another point you mentioned that you're likely to get a little bit of protection from the tariffs against that import flow, although you weren't very specific about that. Now you mentioned a moment ago about Dexter and Falcon. And I guess you're pushing through pricing out the spread between where you're pricing either your high-end or you're tactical brands is opening up versus that import flow. Are you concerned about the second half? And you've managed it so well up to now, but does it kick in and become a more formidable issue in the second half, people mixing down a little more into those tactical brands, or do you get that protection from the tariffs and that gives you a little bit of leeway? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Tariffs really have a little effect on us. In some of the opening price point, mid-price point, it could be opportunistic, but to be determined. But in terms of how I think about the tariffs, it's really \u2013 they're rounding here, number one. Number two, I like the end market fundamentals. I think I'm mindful we're in one of the longest recoveries in history, but as I look out end market fundamentals especially around institutional, which we like, are positive, I think we comment on chop. Labor still concerns me. I just ran a price increase through, what are the effects of that. I think through July it seems like our demand continues to be solid. And I think as we've shown in the first half, we're going to be able to manage through the different variables and continue to operate at a good level here at Allegion. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : What did that commercial business \u2013 what impact did that have on that 5.2% consolidated organic growth in the quarter? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : David, if you look at what we've put in the slides we said that commercial ex-acquisitions or nonres ex-acquisitions was higher than res. We don't give the exact numbers. But we did give some detail on the slide. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : I'm just trying to get the commercial versus the institutional, which is a- Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : We don't disclose that detail. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Sure. Can you \u2013 is there any way you could just size that business for us, your most recent sizing? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah. If you think about nonres, nonres is about 70% of the Americas. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Right. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : And of that, 60% is institutional, 40% is commercial. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Thanks. My second question was just on the K-12 in the college business. It's seasonal business. This is the time of the year that typically favors. How was the growth there this year versus say last year? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : The growth from 2017 to 2018 across the institutional segment was up. And we \u2013 as we look out to 2019, our anticipation is that it will stay at that level. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : For K-12 in college? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Yes. K-12, there's a demand for increased security. And college campuses and K-12 from an infrastructure standpoint are still trying to dig themselves out of the deficit that was created from 2008 to 2012. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : All right. So the growth there over index the broader 5.2% number. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : We're not getting into a detailed vertical growth rates. David. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. All right. Great. Thanks very much and congrats on the progress. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Rizk Maidi with Berenberg. Rizk Maidi - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Yes. Hi, guys. I'll stick to two. Number one, as we're hearing some companies talking about labor shortages happening in some of the European countries, France, Holland, and Germany, your biggest competitor in Europe warned about demand in France, where housing permits, housing starts are down mid to high-single digits year-to-date. Is this something you guys have seen? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I don't think I'm in a position to comment. As we went through the quarter, it was not an issue. Rizk Maidi - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Okay. And then, secondly, on \u2013 you said that you're expecting the price plus productivity in excess of cost inflation to be positive in nature. Can you just remind us if you are still expecting this equation to be positive for the full year? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : So slightly positive, which requires us to be second half relative to first half to be more positive. So I think we mentioned earlier first half slightly underwater, managing the inflationary headwinds fairly well through pricing actions, and that's going to continue. But pricing improvement should \u2013 and productivity exceed inflation at the back half of the year. Rizk Maidi - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Okay. And then finally on the trade tariffs, I appreciate you guys touching on them. But just from a logistic perspective, do you source any components from China, or do you feel you have to change anything from a supply chain perspective if those tariffs gets implemented? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : We do source components in and products from China. It's common in the industry. We have the flexibility in our supply chain to make adjustments globally, and including in-sourcing. So our industrial teams, our designs are set up to be able to have the adaptability to respond. Rizk Maidi - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Thank you. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : We'll see where that proposed legislation ends up. Any partial year impact states that it's not a significant exposure. We do a lot of in-region sourcing. And so, yes, there was an impact. We'll wait and see what the final legislation comes out. But any impact for this year is well-contained within our guidance. No problem there. Rizk Maidi - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Thank you. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. So I'd like to return the floor back to Mike Wagnes for any closing comments. Mike Wagnes - Allegion Plc : I want to thank everyone for participating in the call today. Please reach out to me and contact me for any further questions and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Please go to slide number 4 and I'll turn the call over to Dave. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Thanks, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Allegion delivered another strong quarter in Q3 and I'm pleased with our operational performance, which has positioned us well to deliver a solid 2018. Allegion saw a strong top-line revenue growth in the third quarter with strength across all regions. The Americas saw solid volume in both the non-residential and residential businesses, as end-market fundamentals continue to be positive, particularly in institutional verticals. Price was very strong in the Americas and remain firmed in Europe. Asia-Pacific saw organic growth rebound nicely in the quarter. Acquisitions continue to contribute to total company revenue growth. Electronics growth globally continues to accelerate and was quite substantial during the quarter, led by the Americas region, which saw nearly 30% growth in electronic products during the quarter. We see the electronics growth outlook continuing to be a long-term positive trend, as more and more products become connected for ease of access. We are driving price realization and productivity actions in an effort to mitigate the substantial inflationary pressures we are experiencing. We did experience margin declines in the quarter as acquisitions were diluted. Excluding the 2018 acquisitions, adjusted operating margins were flat year-over-year. I'm very pleased with our ability to manage those inflationary pressures and maintain organic margins through both pricing and cost actions. In the third quarter, we delivered robust EPS growth, seeing more than 20% expansion in adjusted EPS, driven primarily from operations and tax rate benefits. This EPS performance highlights our continued focus on driving increased shareholder value. Last, we are raising our outlook for revenue and EPS. Total revenue growth is projected to be between 13% and 13.5%, raising from our previous range of 12.5% to 13.5%. Organic revenue is being increased to a range of 5% to 5.5%, up from the 4% to 5% provided last quarter. For adjusted EPS, we are raising the range to $4.43 to $4.50 per share, bringing up the low end of our previous outlook, which was $4.35 to $4.50. Please go to slide 5. In Q3, Allegion delivered strong top-line revenue performance. Revenue from the third quarter with $711.5 million, an increase of 16.8%, inclusive of organic growth of 8.5%. Benefits from acquisition also contributed to the top-line revenue expansion, offsetting the slightly unfavorable currency impact. All regions grew organically. America led the way with organic growth of just over 10% in the quarter, supported by robust growth in electronics, strong pricing, and solid volume in both the nonresidential and residential businesses. The EMEIA regions saw organic growth of 3.4% and Asia-Pacific organic growth rebounded nicely, coming in at nearly 6%. Adjusted operating margins decreased by 140 basis points due to the dilution related to our acquisitions made earlier this year. Excluding the impact of those acquisitions, the base operating margins were flat year-over-year as the business did a good job of driving price realization and productivity savings to combat continued inflationary pressures. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.23 increased $0.21 or 20.6% versus the prior year. The increase was driven by our operational performance and a favorable year-over-year tax rate. Year-to-date available cash flow is up more than $90 million nearly 68%. The prior year discretionary pension funding payment, along with increased earnings, are driving the increase. Please go to slide 6. Electronic growth continues to accelerate. Our global brands continue to innovate to develop smart solutions across residential and nonresidential markets. One recent example of such innovation is the SimonsVoss SmartHandle AX, which was launched in the third quarter. The SmartHandle AX is a modular handset that leverages the SimonsVoss AX platform. This means the solution has a flexible design that can adapt to different door variants and global standards, while also offering smart features like Bluetooth phone-to-door communication. We are excited that this technology can be leveraged globally because of its adaptability and open architecture. What's more interesting, the SmartHandle AX has an intrinsic security feature to put users' minds at ease. It fits seamlessly into existing security hardware environments with retrofit features, including door monitoring. At Allegion, innovation in access is an opportunity to put our customers first. Our SimonsVoss SmartHandle AX offers security and compatibility as well as easy installation and extended battery life without compromising design quality. Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2018 outlook. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. If you would, please go to slide number 7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the third quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 8.5% organic growth in the third quarter. This high organic growth rate reflects outstanding performance in the Americas region, which saw very good price, solid volumes in both the nonresidential and residential businesses, and nearly 30% growth in electronic products. The significant growth in electronics occurred in both the residential and nonresidential businesses as Allegion continues to be well-positioned to take advantage of the industry trend of moving toward electronic locks and connected security solutions. Pricing for Allegion, in total, was strong in the quarter and more than offset material inflation, as the company is taking necessary actions to help mitigate the impact of continued inflationary pressures. Third quarter price realization was strong in our Americas and EMEIA businesses, with pricing that was essentially flat in Asia-Pacific. Overall, I was very pleased with the improvement in pricing, both year-over-year and sequentially. The pricing performance demonstrates the strength in our brands, products and channels. Also, during the third quarter, acquisitions contributed 9% and foreign currency was a slight headwind in all three regions. Please go to slide number 8. Reported net revenues for the third quarter were $711.5 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 16.8% versus the prior year, up 8.5% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $149 million increased nearly 10% over the same timeframe last year. Adjusted operating margin of 20.9% decreased 140 basis points with the decrease driven by dilution from acquisitions. Excluding the 2018 acquisitions, adjusted operating margins on the base business were flat year-over-year. Total inflation slightly exceeded price plus productivity, as price realization and necessary cost containment actions, which drive productivity, helped mitigate the impact of inflationary headwinds. Other headwinds to margin performance were incremental investments, which had a 50 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins. And while acquisitions were dilutive to margins, they were accretive to adjusted earnings per share. Please go to slide number 9. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2017, reported EPS was $0.94. Adjusting $0.08 for the prior year restructuring expenses, integration cost-related acquisitions and charges related to debt refinancing, the 2017 adjusted earnings per share was $1.02. Operational results increased EPS by $0.11 as favorable price, operating leverage on incremental volume and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. Favorable year-over-year tax rate drove another $0.10 with the favorability driven primarily by the favorable impact of tax reform, favorable discrete items and changes in the mix of income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions. Acquisitions contributed $0.02 in the quarter. The combination of interest expense, other income and non-controlling interest increased earnings per share by a penny, with favorability from interest offset by the prior-year non-operating gains. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.03 reduction. These incremental investments for new product development, channel strategies and demand creation spending to take advantage of the accelerating electronic products market, continue to drive above-market growth and are providing solid returns on our investment. This results in adjusted third quarter 2018 earnings per share of $1.23, an increase of $0.21 or 20.6% compared to the prior year. Lastly, we have a $0.02 per share reduction for charges related to acquisitions and restructuring as well as adjustments to the provisions related to the enactment of tax reform. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at third quarter 2018 reported earnings per share of $1.21. Please go to slide number 10. Third quarter revenues for the Americas region were $530.1 million, up 16.5% on a reported basis and 10.1% organically. The organic growth was driven by robust growth in electronic products, which came in at nearly 30%. Pricing was also very strong in the quarter, delivering 2.5 points of revenue growth. Both the non-residential and residential businesses saw a solid volume performance. The non-residential business grew low-double digits, excluding acquisitions. Residential experienced high-single digit growth. Acquisitions added 6.6% growth to total revenue. Americas' adjusted operating income of $154.3 million increased 11.4% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 130 basis points. The decrease in adjusted operating margin was driven primarily by the dilutive acquisitions. Excluding these acquisitions, adjusted operating margins on the base business were down slightly year-over-year as price, productivity and volume leverage nearly offset the impact of high inflation and headwinds from incremental investments. Please go to slide number 11. Third quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $134.4 million, up 7.4% and up 3.4% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by solid pricing for the quarter and strength in electronics driven by the SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses. The reported revenue increase was boosted by acquisitions, which more than offset currency headwinds. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $10.2 million increased slightly versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 50 basis points driven by margin dilution from acquisitions. The base business saw margins increase with volume leverage, price and productivity more than offsetting inflation and incremental investments. Please go to slide number 12. Third quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $47 million, up 61.5% versus the prior year. Organic revenue rebounded nicely, growing at 5.9% and was volume-driven. Total revenue growth was driven by the GWA Door and Access Business acquisition. Foreign currency was a headwind for the quarter. Asia-Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $3.2 million, an increase of $1 million, with adjusted operating margins down 80 basis points versus the prior year period. Similar to other regions, dilution from acquisitions drove the margin decline. The base business adjusted operating margins were up slightly, with price and productivity more than offsetting the unfavorable impacts from inflation, incremental investments and mix. Please go to slide number 13. Year-to-date, available cash flow for the third quarter 2018 was $228.6 million, which is an increase of $92.3 million compared to the prior year period. The increase is driven by the non-recurring $50 million discretionary pension funding payment that was made in the first quarter of 2017, along with higher net earnings and favorable working capital changes. Working capital as a percent of revenues and the ratio for the cash conversion cycle increased slightly in the third quarter 2018 when compared to the prior year period. The increase is primarily driven by working capital related to recently acquired businesses. As always, we remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow. Lastly, we are affirming our full year available cash flow outlook of $380 million to $400 million I'd now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2018 outlook. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Thank you, Patrick. Please go to slide number 14. As noted on the slide, we are updating revenue outlooks for all regions and for the company as a whole. We are raising total and organic revenue growth in the Americas and lowering total and organic revenue growth outlooks for both Europe and Asia. This results in the consolidated outlook for total revenue increasing to a range of 13% to 13.5% and organic revenue increasing to a range of 5% to 5.5%. If we look closer at the Americas business, end market fundamentals remain solid as evidenced by our third quarter results and we continue to see positive indicators in the nonresidential markets with particular strength in institutional verticals, which is expected to continue through 2019. We expect a strong demand for electronic products, especially residential electronic locks, to continue as more residential consumers desire connected smart access to their homes. European markets are expected to continue to see modest growth driven by electronic products. General European macroeconomic conditions, like consumer and business confidence, remain positive, but are softening. The GDP in all of our key economies are expanding. In the Asia-Pacific region, we should see solid growth with strength in electronic products. However, the markets in our Australia and New Zealand businesses have slowed. The total revenue growth for Asia-Pacific will continue to be bolstered by the acquired GWA Door and Access businesses. We expect inflationary pressures to continue for the remainder of the year. The Americas price increase put in place during the quarter has gained good traction and will continue to help mitigate the impacts of inflation. We are raising our reported earnings per share outlook to a range of $4.23 to $4.35 up from $4.15 to $4.35. And we're also raising adjusted earnings per share to $4.43 to $4.50, up from the previous range of $4.35 to $4.50. This represents adjusted EPS growth of approximately 12% to 14%. As Patrick stated, we are also affirming our cash flow outlook of $380 million to $400 million. The outlook assumes the full year tax rate to be approximately 14.5% and outstanding diluted shares of approximately 96 million. As noted, there is no change to our assumption for investment spend in the outlook. It remains at $0.15 per share. Please go to slide 15. As a summary of Allegion's Q3 performance, total revenue grew nearly 17%. Organic revenue grew 8.5%. Adjusted operating margins were down 140 basis points and were flat when excluding the impact of acquisitions. Adjusted EPS saw more than 20% growth in the quarter. End market fundamentals in the Americas remain strong. Now, I and Patrick will be happy to take your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Maybe a first question around the margin impact of inflation relative to price and productivity, similar to Q2, it was a slight headwind, I guess, to margins in Q3. How are you thinking about that spread into Q4 and then, particularly, into next year as tariffs continue to rise? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah. So, Julian, as you indicated, Q3 on a dollars basis, we're a little bit underwater, not significantly. So, I think the team, in aggregate, has done a really good job to help mitigate the inflationary headwinds with incremental pricing. And you saw the price realization come in extremely strong, particularly in Americas. So, really good progress there. As you're aware, we're starting to see the inflation, particularly as it relates to inputs on commodities, to be more stable. And with the incremental price realization, we'd anticipate Q4 to be slightly positive. So, we're starting to turn the corner is how I would suggest in Q4. As we look out going forward, the way I would think about it, you really need to look at the components of both price and your assumptions for inflation. As you saw in Q3, outstanding price realization, north of 2%, that provides a very good backdrop and tailwind, if you will, in terms of price improvement, particularly in the first half of next year, which you may recall this year, we only had about a 1% price improvement year-over-year in the first half. So, good tailwind there. In inflation, again, material stabilized. So if you assume there's not a big increase relative to the current spot rates, which if you look, by the way, whether it be steel, brass or zinc, the current spot rates are anywhere from 10% to 20% lower than the peak spot rates in earlier this year. So, I'd expect lower inflation next year. And so, what's the net of all this mean? It means that we should see significant improvement in terms of the price/cost dynamic in 2019 going forward, and that should help us in margin accretion for next year. I think it sets us up well. One other thing I'll note is that, keep in mind, you're seeing margin dilution from this price/cost dynamic because, essentially, we're holding flat, offsetting inflation with price. And the tyranny of the math, if you will, suggests that you're going to have margin dilution, maybe not dollars, but certainly margin dilution if you're not getting more than 20% north of your inflation. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. That's very clear. And then, my second and last question will just be on the Americas region; in particular, noticed the higher investment spend as a headwind in Q3. When you think about the Americas overall as a region, is there anything that in terms of market structure or competition or investment requirements that means that your margins have kind of peaked or do you see a good path still for margin expansion in the medium term in the Americas? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Still see opportunity for margin expansion, just as I've mentioned, getting margin accretion associated with this price inflation dynamic. Also, the incremental margin on volume is still quite strong, 40-plus percent. Don't see any pressure as it relates to pricing that would deteriorate that going forward; and, the market fundamentals, extremely strong, particularly in Americas. So, there's nothing that I could see that would suggest any margin dilution or we're peaked on margin going forward. As you think about investments, we will continue to invest in the business. There's opportunities to drive the business faster, I would say, particularly around electronics in terms of demand creation. And we'll continue to look at those opportunities. And there'll be more color provided on next quarter's conference call. But I think we've got good opportunity to continue margin accretion as well \u2013 not only the base business, but the acquisitions as we continue to accelerate those and fold them into our specification writing capabilities, I think that's going to provide us good opportunities as well as operational excellence improvements. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Yes. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Good morning, Josh. Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just maybe take a step back here for a second. I think at your Analyst Day last year, you reiterated your long-term EPS growth algorithm of 10%. And I know there are a lot of moving pieces, particularly around price/cost, and maybe a bit more macro agita than we had a quarter or two ago. But, Dave, you talked about still having strong visibility in institutional, that that continues into 2019. Is there any reason from what you see today that that shouldn't be still a reliable starting point for people to think about that EPS growth algorithm over the next, call it, year plus? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : We stand behind our long-term outlook in terms of EPS growth. We were strong this morning in our belief in end markets, and especially around the institutional piece. You can look at education, healthcare and areas that we do well in; I like the outlook for 2019. Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. And then, just a follow-up on an electromech, 30%'s a big number and I know not the most \u2013 the largest installed base out there, or the largest base, but anything new either on the product side or new channels that we should think about as maybe that 30% cascades out for a couple more quarters? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I think... Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Something like it. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Especially, in U.S. res, you see acceleration, because of new entrants, because of things like last-mile delivery. But I think the maturity of the keyless world continues to develop globally. We're extremely pleased with our electronic development globally, but a bright line shining on SimonsVoss and Interflex. We think this market has a decade run. And when you start thinking about access as an opportunity, smart devices, the proliferation of cell phone, smart credentials will redefine access in the next decade. And we think Allegion's in a great position, along with the security industry, to be able to take advantage of that. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah. I would just add too, Josh, that if you think about the trend here, this is a, as we've indicated, low penetration on electronic locks and home, we'll call it high-single digits. And so, that provides for a good backdrop for continued growth. And just a reminder that we're not as dependent upon new construction in the resi market, a lot of our sell-through is DIY. And so, I just think there is significant opportunity, as homes become more connected, to accelerate this whole electronics growth. Good secular trend, not as dependent upon new construction going forward. Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Appreciate the color, guys. Operator : The next question comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Walsh - Credit Suisse : Hi. Good morning. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Good morning, John. John Walsh - Credit Suisse : Hey. So, wanted to ask a question about the strong free cash flow generation as we think about the deployment of that and maybe you can give us a little bit of color on how your pipeline looks. Obviously, you've been able to successfully get several deals here done in the year. But how does that look kind of going forward? And do you have the ability to kind of continue to do deals given that you are integrating a few right now, even though they're smaller? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So, number one, pleased with the cash flow generation of the business, especially the core. We challenged our teams in January that we expected better inventory management on the core business, and they've done a good job to optimize that. And it's showing on the bottom line in terms of cash. Expect us to go in and drive improvements in the acquisition side of what we're acquiring as well. I think, two, when you move (32:21) how we'll deploy that cash, the acquisition pipeline continues to be active, robust. We did six acquisitions in the first half. So, we're in the process of digesting those, but our people continue to develop the relationships that complement that pipeline. I think we're more mindful in terms of the access in the future and how electronic, software and systems can help leverage our core business. With that said, assets are expensive in the M&A pipeline. And we've said that if we can't deploy that cash, we will return it in terms of share buybacks and dividends to our shareholders. John Walsh - Credit Suisse : Thank you. And then, maybe just following back on an earlier question around tariffs and the outlook going forward. Clearly, the spot rate today, obviously, if we run the math forward, but how would you contemplate or how would you react if we do see that List 3 kind of increase in \u2013 as we think about next year? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah. So, the first point is that we do not have significant exposure on imports from China. It's predominantly on fighter brands, accessories, those type of things, because we do a lot of region insource and manufacturing. So, I'd say, low exposure from an overall perspective. On the materials that we do import here to the U.S., we have a couple alternatives to mitigate. One is find alternative sources of supply, which we're working on. And two is to mitigate it by a price increase. And with the products that are impacted by the L3, we have already gone out and announced a price increase effective December 1 and to help mitigate that. So when I look at the impact for 2019, I would say the expectation is it will be offset entirely, i.e., no impact; and then for the balance of this year, minimal impact, if any. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I'd reemphasize, our North American supply chain is local, in North America. And it gives us some of the best margins in our industry that we continue to focus on to meet customer requirements and drive productivity. We think it's a good setup. We work to try and emulate that globally, where we can have competitive supply chains that helped us put up industry-leading margins. John Walsh - Credit Suisse : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC : Hi, good morning. Rob Aurand, on for David today. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Good morning. Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC : I guess just looking at mix within the Americas, can you talk about kind of the growth you're seeing in the premium brands versus the fighter brands? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah. I would say, similar across the board, premium may be a little bit stronger, particularly as institutional markets recover. And that, as you know, is a really good trend from an overall market demand, because we got favorable mix there. Strength across all the brands and product categories, maybe the premium brands doing a little bit better than the fighter brands. But we're seeing good growth, particularly as it relates to our channel-led initiative on the discretionary business here in the U.S., which is more of a lower price point type of product. So, overall, strong growth in all the brands and products. Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. And obviously, acquisitions are dilutive right now. Can you give us a sense of when could the current acquisitions become accretive to margins? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : So, the expectation is that we would begin to see some benefits next year as we continue to integrate those businesses and leverage a little bit more on top-line growth. So, I would expect some year-over-year improvement. The margin profile of those acquisitions collectively aren't at the aggregate margins that we see today, but they should begin to show some positive incremental improvement next year, if you're looking at it a year-over-year basis. Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Tim Wojs of Baird. Please go ahead. Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Good morning, Tim. Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, just circling back to the electronics growth. Just that 30%, that's an organic number? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yes. Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, is there a way just to think about how the growth rate kind of compares on the residential side and maybe the commercial side within electronics? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah. So, we're not going to give specific numbers, but resi a little bit higher than the non-resi piece. Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Okay. And then just my follow up, you talked about some pretty strong institutional visibility. How about some of the commercial markets as you go into 2019? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : I think it's no secret that the commercial environment is peaked. We still see opportunities in that market. 800 hotel rooms announced last Sunday here in Indianapolis would be an example of that. We think our product positioning gives us the opportunity to continue the growth along with our channel initiatives. But as you think about 2019, healthcare, education look favorable. Our quotation activity looks favorable and we'll continue to take what the commercial market gives us as we move forward. Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Well, good luck on the rest of the year, I guess. Thanks. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : See you in a couple of weeks. Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Definitely. Operator : The next question comes from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Ron J. Jewsikow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah. Good morning. This is Ron Jewsikow on for Rich. Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Good morning. Ron J. Jewsikow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Just drilling down a bit further on the M&A dilution in the Americas, because it was a pretty sizable step-up versus last quarter's headwind, we're calculating an operating margin on the acquired business a little under 10%. First, is that correct? And second, what's included in that figure such as (39:29) or integration cost or anything like that? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yes. So, that would be fairly close. Keep in mind, there's heavy amortization expense associated with intangibles. So, really, on a cash basis, EBITDA is the mid-teens \u2013 mid to high teens. And so, hey, look, the performance of the business under a little bit of pressure, like we mentioned, associated with the base business in terms of higher inflation, those type of things. And I would expect those businesses, again, as that subsides a little bit more, to improve margins going forward. Ron J. Jewsikow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Appreciate that color. And then, just a follow up. I know you guys have been hesitant to give this in the past, but given where we are right now I think for resi, can you provide new construction versus reno split, or how much of resi sales are direct to the builder channel? Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc : Yeah. Ron, when you look at our residential business, we're more aftermarket than new construction. So definitely, north of 50% is aftermarket, the biggest channel being through big-box retailers. We don't give the exact amount, but as you think of our business, it's not as tied to new build at all. Ron J. Jewsikow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Appreciate that. Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Kessler of Imperial Capital. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : Thank you. At the GSX conference where you folks demonstrated some of your new products and businesses, one of the things that we spent a lot \u2013 a long time on was your Overtur spec-writing system. To the extent that you can talk about it, number one, what is the game plan in terms of integrating existing, want to call it, organic company with new acquisitions into that spec, you want to call it, collaborative spec-writing capability? And number two, what markets do you think that this new system will affect first as we take a look at what seems to be a technology step ahead of the competition? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So, thanks for pointing out our development of Overtur. It's a system that helps our spec writers connect with architects and designers. It's something that we've been developing over the last year here at Allegion. Number one, look for us to expand that into acquisitions integrations as we move forward. Number two, if you think about the world of specification, especially with architects, new architects entering the space expect to be connected digitally. And we think Overtur is a nice step up for that. It provides features that drive efficiencies in terms of the design and project management, and it will help us put, what I would describe, hooks in that design phase and build on the competitive advantage that already exist. Allegion, particularly in the Americas, has one of the strongest spec-writing capabilities and investing in digital tools to advance that's the right step. We like our position there. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : Okay. Also, if I could just ask a question about one of the smaller acquisitions that you made, a company that we've worked with in the past, ISONAS. They're known for essentially having, if you want to call it, their power reader-controllers, basically supplanting one big box that you had to put at the door. What markets are they, or you in conjunction now, working toward to start introducing that product through Allegion? David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So, I don't know that I'd want to show my hand there, but we believe, around the institutional markets advancing our wireless access technologies, that that's a perfect fit for us. And you think about the sets of products that we have in terms of wireless access design, we like how that can advance us in our growth in that segment, Jeff. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : Okay. I don't have a third question to ask, but I will get you guys back on this later. Thank you very much. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Maybe you can appreciate that I just don't want to throw my cards on the table there. Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC : I understand that. Okay. Thank you. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Thank you. Mike Wagnes - Allegion Plc : Andrew, do we have another caller in the queue? Operator : Yes. We do have a question from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. So, just talking about that 30% growth in electronics this quarter, obviously, nice uptick. Maybe \u2013 if you could maybe just provide a little bit more color. What do you think is really driving that growth? Is this kind of like a new normal? Is there any color around whether it's product introductions or different channels that you're selling through would be helpful. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : So, I'd point to a couple areas, (45:42) overall broad awareness. Last mile delivery, smart doorbells, all starts with dialog, does your front door connect as well as my front door. I think second is the advancement of e-commerce. Whether it's Home Depot, Amazon, our e-commerce channels are growing extremely nicely, and this is a click-and-play type product. I think our brand is significant here. There has been some research out in the market that talks about the importance of brand awareness in the market. And we think the Schlage brand, our star ratings, if you look into some of that, the highest star ratings with the most reviews on our products are things that line up nicely for Allegion. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. No, that makes sense, Dave. And maybe since you brought it up, any color you can give on Amazon Key, your product introductions, I think, you're still scheduled for later this year. Any update on that would be helpful. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : We will have a product available imminently that's compatible with Amazon Key. That was our commitment, and we're there. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc : And let me add a little bit to that. We are compatible with a variety of operating systems, and we'll have a release in this quarter that connects with a world that's moving all the time. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mike Wagnes for any closing remarks. Mike Wagnes - Allegion Plc : We'd like to thank everyone for participating in today's call. Please contact me for any further questions, and have a great day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Allegion saw another quarter of strong topline revenue growth with strength across all regions. The Americas saw strong volumes in the nonresidential business as end market fundamentals continue to be positive, particularly in institutional verticals. EMEA and Asia-Pacific saw organic growth rates in the mid-single digits. Acquisitions continued to contribute to total company revenue growth. Electronics growth moderated in the fourth quarter, with the Americas seeing approximately 7% growth. Residential electronics performed well. However, the nonresidential electronics growth decelerated due to the timing of large orders. We had full-year electronics growth of high teens in the Americas, with strength in both parts of the business. We see the electronics outlook continue to be a long-term positive trend as more and more products become connected for ease of access. As I stated earlier, nonresidential US end markets remain healthy, with particular strength in institutional verticals. We do see residential new construction softening, but we expect this to be mitigated by electronics and channel initiatives to drive above-market growth.  The quarter saw continued inflationary pressures which we believe will ease in 2019. Commodities have leveled off and we project to have another solid year in price realization, with particular strength in our Americas nonresidential businesses. In the fourth quarter, we delivered nearly 10% adjusted EPS growth, bringing the full year expansion to approximately 14% as we drove a robust 37% increase in available cash flow which totaled more than $400 million for the year. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the revenue performance in both the quarter and the full year. Additionally, while operating margin could have been better, I'm satisfied with the growth in EPS that we delivered in the quarter and the full year. Please go to slide 5 and I'll walk through the fourth-quarter financial summary. In Q4, Allegion delivered strong topline revenue growth. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $702.4 million, an increase of 12.4%, inclusive of the organic growth of 6.7%.  Acquisitions also contributed to the topline revenue expansion, offsetting the slightly unfavorable currency impact. All regions grew organically. Americas led the way with organic growth of 7.6% in the quarter, driven by strength in our nonresidential business. The EMEA region saw organic growth of 4.3%, driven by performance in the SimonsVoss and the Interflex businesses. Asia-Pacific had a nice quarter of organic growth, coming in at 4.6% against a tough comparable. Adjusted operating margins decreased 130 basis points due to the dilution related to acquisitions made in 2018. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, the base operating margins were up 20 basis points. Inflationary headwinds continued to pressure margin and exceeded price and productivity in the quarter. The company is committed to driving price realization and productivity actions, such that, for 2019, the price-productivity-inflation dynamic is expected to be positive, helping to drive margin expansion across all regions of the business. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.22 increased $0.11 or nearly 10% versus the prior year. The increase was driven by higher operating income along with a favorable year-over-year tax rate.  Available cash flow for the year came in over $408 million, an increase of more than 37% versus prior year. Increased earnings and the non-reoccurring 2017 discretionary pension funding drove the increase. Please go to slide 6. Before I turn the call over to Patrick, I want to talk a little about some of the things we are doing in the connected home space.  In 2015, Schlage was the first smart lock to respond to \"Hey, Siri. Open my lock.\" Now, Schlage Encode is the first lock to work with the Key by Amazon app and ring devices without needing a Wi-Fi hub. It's built right into the lock. With Schlage Encode, we took a different approach to development. Starting first with the connected home platform and developing the lock around the desired user experience, the user-first approach is part of our strategic plan to develop and integrate with leaders in connected home platforms. In addition, we recently announced the Schlage Connect Z-Wave Plus enhancement and its compatibility with ring and Schlage Connect Zigbee certified locks with support home automation systems. Our deep experience in connected home security has made us a go-to partner for a wide variety of platforms and home automation solutions, including Amazon, Ring, Alarm.com, Google and Apple. We will continue to build relationships to benefit consumers and accelerate adoption of Schlage smart products. Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I'll be back to update you on our full-year 2019 outlook. Patrick Shannon : Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. If you would, please go to slide number seven. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the fourth quarter as well as the full year of 2018. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 6.7% organic growth in the fourth quarter. This performance reflects another strong quarter in the Americas region, which delivered 7.6% organic growth led by the nonresidential markets. EMEA and Asia-Pacific saw continued momentum with mid-single-digit organic growth. Pricing for Allegion in the quarter came in at 1.5%. The company will continue to take necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures and any additional tariff impacts. Also during the fourth quarter, acquisitions contributed more than 7% growth and foreign currency was a slight headwind in all three regions. With the fourth quarter performance, you can see where we ended up for the full year on revenue growth. We delivered more than 13% total revenue growth with double-digit topline growth in all three regions. Organic growth came in at 6% led by the Americas at nearly 7%. Please go to slide number eight. Reported net revenues for the fourth quarter were $702.4 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 12.7% versus the prior year, up 6.7% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $145.2 million increased nearly 6% over the same timeframe from last year. Adjusted operating margin of 20.7% decreased 130 basis points, with the decrease driven by dilution from acquisitions. Excluding the 2018 acquisitions, adjusted operating margin on the base business was up 20 basis points year-over-year. Total inflation exceeded price plus productivity by approximately $2.5 million and was dilutive to adjusted operating margins by 70 basis points. We are committed to driving the price-productivity-inflation dynamic positive in 2019 through the following actions. Price realization, improved productivity and operational efficiencies, acquisition integration performance, and softening inflation during the year. Other headwinds to margin performance were incremental investments, which had a 40 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins. As discussed, these incremental investments accelerate topline growth. Please go slide number 9. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2017, reported earnings per share was $0.10. Adjusting $1.01 for the prior-year restructuring expenses, integration costs related to acquisitions, charges related to US tax reform and debt refinancing, the 2017 adjusted earnings per share was $1.11. Operating results increased earnings per share by $0.10 as favorable price, operating leverage on incremental volume and productivity more than offset inflationary impact. Favorable year-over-year tax rate drove another $0.07, with the favorability driven primarily by lower tax rates associated with tax reform along with favorable discrete items. Acquisitions were a $0.01 drag in the quarter, reflecting worse-than-anticipated performance associated with the QMI acquisition in Europe. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.02 reduction. These incremental investments for new product development, channel strategies and demand creation spending continue to drive above-market growth and are providing solid returns on our investment. The combination of interest expense, other income and non-controlling interests decreased earnings per share by $0.03. This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2018 earnings per share of $1.22, an increase of $0.11 or nearly 10% compared to the prior-year period. Lastly, we have a $0.17 per share benefit primarily driven by adjustments to the provisions related to the enactment of tax reform, which more than offset reductions for charges related to acquisitions and restructuring. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at fourth-quarter 2018 reported earnings per share of $1.39. Please go to slide number 10. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $492.7 million, up 13% on a reported basis and 7.6% organically. The organic growth was driven by strong volume in the nonresidential business as well as continued pricing benefits. The electronics growth for the quarter was approximately 7%. Residential electronics in the quarter performed well. However, nonresidential electronics growth decelerated due to timing of large orders. For the full year, growth in electronic products was solid, coming in at high teens, with strength in both residential and nonresidential products.  Price realization in the quarter was 1.5%. Pricing in the nonresidential business was strong, offset by residential promotional activities. The nonresidential business grew low-double digits excluding acquisitions. Residential growth was flat in the quarter with strength in electronics, offset by some cannibalization of the mechanical business. Acquisitions added nearly 6% to total revenue. Americas adjusted operating income of $131.8 million increased 5.3% versus the prior-year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 190 basis points. The 2018 acquisitions continued to be dilutive as expected and had 120 basis point impact. Inflation and incremental investments exceeded price plus productivity in the quarter. Strong volume leverage and positive mix partially offset these impacts. Please go to slide number 11. Fourth quarter revenues for the EMEA region were $157.4 million, up 4.4% and up 4.3% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by solid pricing for the quarter and strength in electronics, led by the SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses. The impact of acquisitions offset currency headwinds. EMEA adjusted operating income of $22.5 million decreased approximately 10% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 230 basis points, driven primarily by dilution from acquisitions. As stated earlier, the poor acquisition performance was driven by our QMI business, which experienced reduced revenues in a challenging market environment, a significant mix shift to lower margin business along with some operational inefficiencies. We have identified areas of opportunity, have commenced plans to get the QMI business back to profitability. Operational performance improvement will gradually occur throughout the course of 2019. In addition, inflation and incremental investments slightly exceeded price plus productivity. Strong volume leverage offset some of these unfavorable impacts. Please go to slide number 12. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $52.3 million, up 44.9% versus the prior year. Organic revenue continued to rebound, growing nicely at 4.6% against a tough comparable. Total revenue growth was driven by the GWA Door and Access business acquisition. Foreign currency was a headwind for the quarter. Asia-Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $6.5 million, an increase of nearly $2 million with adjusted operating margins down 60 basis points versus the prior-year period. Diluted from acquisitions drove the margin decline.  The base business adjusted operating margins were up 120 basis points with price and productivity more than offsetting the favorable impacts from inflation and incremental investments. Good volume leverage was able to offset negative mix. Please go to slide number 13. Available cash flow for 2018 came in at $408.7 million, which is an increase of $110.8 million compared to the prior-year period. The increase was driven by higher net earnings, along with the non-recurring $50 million discretionary pension funding payment that was made in the first quarter of 2017. Available cash flow continues to remain strong and exceeded prior estimates. Working capital as a percent of revenues increased slightly in fourth-quarter 2018 when compared to the prior-year period. The increase is primarily driven by working capital related to recently acquired businesses. And while working capital as a percent of revenue saw a slight increase, we did see a reduction in the cash conversion cycle. As always, we remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital and will continue to evaluate opportunities to minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow. I'll now hand the call back over to Dave for a review on our full-year 2019 outlook. David Petratis : Thank you, Patrick. Please go slide number 14. We continue to see favorable trends on our primary end markets in 2019. And it is our expectation that the organic investments, combined with our ability to execute, will again deliver better than market growth. We also believe the electronic portfolio will continue to outpace mechanical in all regions and we are well-positioned to continue to take advantage of this industry trend. In the Americas, we see continued positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals, led by the institutional markets. We expect the general trend toward electronic products to continue, which helped mitigate the softening that we are expecting in residential new construction. With these expectations, we project organic revenue growth in the Americas of 5% to 6%. We are projecting Americas' total revenue expansion to also be 5% to 6%, with any remaining impact from the 2018 acquisitions to be offset by currency headwinds. For the EMEA region, we expect strength in our electronics business to more than offset weaknesses in Southern Europe and the United Kingdom. For the region, we project organic growth of 2.5% to 4.5%. Currency headwinds are expected to more than offset acquisition benefits, bringing expected total revenue growth in EMEA region to flat to 2%. In Asia-Pacific, we continue to see healthy growth in China, with softening markets in Australia and New Zealand. Organic growth in the region is estimated to be 4% to 6% and total revenue growth is estimated to be 22% to 24%, reflecting the full-year impact of the acquisition of Gainsborough Hardware and API. All in, we are projecting total growth of the company at 5% to 6% and our organic growth also at 5% to 6%. Please go to slide 15. Our 2019 outlook for adjusted earnings per share is $4.75 to $4.90, an increase of approximately 6% to 9%. As indicated, the earnings increase is driven by revenue growth and operational improvements as adjusted operating earnings are expected to increase 10% to 14%. Inflationary pressures will continue to be a headwind in the first half of the year, but we anticipate pricing and productivity actions to help drive margin expansion for 2019. Incremental investments continue to be a headwind as we continue to focus on accelerating new product development and channel initiatives, which we believe enable us to keep delivering above-market growth and allowing us to take advantage of the shifting customer preferences to electronic products. Other expense is expected to be a drag on EPS, primarily driven by pension expense. Our outlook assumes a full-year effective tax rate of approximately 16%, an increase from 13.5% in 2018 and outstanding diluted shares of approximately 95.5 million. The outlook also includes $0.15 per share impact from restructuring charges and acquisition-related costs during the year. As a result, reported EPS is estimated to be $4.60 to $4.75. We are projecting our available cash flow for 2019 to be in the $430 million to $450 million range. Please go to slide 16. We're very pleased with our 2018 topline growth that delivered organic revenue expansion of 6%, driven by electronics which we see as a positive trend for us in the future. While operating margin could have been better, we did deliver full-year adjusted EPS growth of nearly 14% in 2018 and we saw a robust 37% increase in available cash flow to more than $400 million. As we look to 2019, we expect to drive continual organic growth above market. We also expect to deliver solid growth in adjusted EPS and generate substantial available cash flow. We are well-positioned for 2019 and are committed to make the world safer, securing the places where people thrive.  I want to finish by saying that 2018 also marks Allegion's first five years as an independent company From the beginning, we told customers, shareholders and employees we would deliver sustained profitable growth and greater value. We have delivered industry-leading organic growth at a five-year CAGR of 5.6%. We have industry-leading margins. We are focused on the safety of our employees, health of our employees and employee engagement. We invested in the business, especially in electronics, and our positioned nicely for the future. Allegion is a company our shareholders can be proud to own. Now, Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Yes, thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And this morning's first question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Good morning. This is Josh Hanson in for Tim. David Petratis : Good morning, Josh. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to ask about the Americas segment. The pricing versus productivity and inflation comparison seems to be more challenging this quarter. I know you mentioned the residential price dynamic, but just wondering what were some of the important drivers behind that. Did higher raw material costs start to flow through the balance sheet? Just kind of give us some color on that, would be great. Patrick Shannon : Yeah. So, Josh, I would characterize it as follows. We commented really good strength in pricing in the commercial area. Pricing on residential was lower than anticipated, primarily due to promotional activities and some rebates and those type of things. And that ebbs and flows during the course of the year occasionally. So, a little bit lower pricing than anticipated on the residential side. On the productivity, continue to get good productivity, particularly on materials. Inflation was more than anticipated, not so much on the raw materials, but more on the nonmaterial side. So, inefficiencies associated with nonmaterials on manufacturing, those type of things. As we look forward to 2019, we believe we have a very strong pipeline in terms of productivity on both material and productivity projects from a manufacturing perspective. The dynamic will become positive in 2019 and it will continue to get better during the course of the year, particularly on the inflation side where, as you know, the commodities have kind of stabilized today relative to where they were in Q3. It starts to almost become deflation in the second half of the year, so that will benefit us as we progress throughout 2019. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thanks for the color there, Patrick. And for my follow-up, could I ask about the electronics growth? You mentioned a larger order within the commercial side. I guess, is it one large project in the prior year or some distributor dynamics, just some color on what drove that and how to think about electronics growth kind of going into next year? Patrick Shannon : So, really good, continued strong growth in resi, electronics. It was more of a tough comp relative to last year on the non-resi side. But as we look forward again to 2019, don't see any reason why we can't sustain kind of mid-teens electronics growth across our portfolio. Feel really good where we're positioned, particularly when we look at some of our new products that we've introduced earlier this year. Dave talked about Encode. I think that's going to grow well for us this year. We've got some other things in the pipeline going forward. So, I think we're well-positioned to continue to take advantage of this trend. And as you know, it's still low penetration rates overall from a residential adoption and new homes. And so, we think that will continue to drive outperformance going forward. David Petratis : Josh, I would just say, in the institutional/commercial, you can get some relatively large projects where you go in and retrofit an entire building or campus. This is what we saw. We continue to be extremely motivated by the growth that we see in electronics and Allegion's position as we go forward. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thanks for the color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. David Petratis : Good morning, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Maybe my first question just around following up on pricing. I think pricing was a bit less of a gross tailwind in Q4 than Q3. It was up I think 1.5 points. The prior quarter, it was up about just over 2% year-on-year. So, maybe just give a bit more color on why that happened on the extent of those promotional activities that you just mentioned and whether you've seen any change in competitive dynamics in any portion of the market in the Americas. Patrick Shannon : Yeah. So, Q4 pricing was anticipated to be sequentially down relative to Q3. And the reason for that is because, in Q3, we basically had the effect of two price increases in there. Remember, we pulled forward the pricing increase at the beginning of the quarter. And 2017, you had a price increase that went into effect in August, and so you had, in effect, two price increases, if you will, for one of the months in the quarter. So, the expectation was that the pricing was going to come down sequentially. 1.5% is still pretty strong when we look at how the rest of the market is performing. Commercial, we continue to perform extremely well. Very pleased with how the team is pushing price there and remaining competitive on big quote activity. The decline may be a little bit lighter than expected and, again, it relates to the residential business on the promotional activities and the sell-through to the consumer. I don't look at that necessarily a longer term impact. Going into 2019, would expect pricing to remain robust and would expect us to be able to deliver kind of the 1.5% increase year-over-year in 2019 relative to 2018. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. And then, my question would really be about the residential business in the Americas in terms of market landscape. Maybe just clarify how much of your Americas business for 2018 as a whole was residential and what do you expect the residential piece of your business to grow in 2019? David Petratis : So, think about a residential position about 30%. As we look to 2019, the new construction elements of the residential market will be softening. I think that's well understood. We have \u2013 in the retrofit side of it, which was our strongest position with our new electronic products, we believe that will give us good opportunities for growth and is really how we've been positioning the company. In a single-family, multi-family, electronic penetration is low single-digits and we're growing well above that, and we think it sets up nicely. We have also, in our channel initiatives, have some success winning some large contract with top builders. And we think, overall, we're set up for a nice year in a softer residential environment. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning, guys. David Petratis : Good morning, Josh. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Just to follow-up on the resi question there, did you see anything in the fourth quarter in terms of destock around the shifting landscape in that channel? It seems like the market share landscape is shifting a little bit, notably that a competitor has had some success with some of their offering. So, I'm wondering how much of what you're seeing is response to the new market versus some channel fill by some other folks. Just trying to get my hands around how much of this is short-term noise versus something that's more of a market-driven weakness over time. David Petratis : I think in terms of the big box, there was some shifting in terms of the timing of orders as they saw deceleration in the res side of the market. We do see new competitors coming into the electronic space around res. I think if you walk through the Consumer Electronics Show, there's many new entries. I think the number of announcements and enhancements that we made to our product portfolio in terms of connectivity, as well as our channel initiatives, it positions us nicely for 2019. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then, on the 2019 implied margin guidance, Patrick, it looks like relative to the way you guys have framed up operating leverage historically that there's, call it, an extra 10 points in incremental margin or maybe $10 million of EBIT. Should we think about that as kind of the catch up from 4Q? If I were to include that in 4Q and say the price cost or some of the other irritation items wouldn't have happened, you would have had a more normal incremental in 4Q. It looks like you're catching that up in 2019. Is that directionally fair? Patrick Shannon : Yeah. I think that's absolutely fair. And as we've indicated on the guidance for 2019, all of the EPS growth is operational related. And it's the pressure on the blow [ph] items that were getting lower than expected earnings per share growth. So, the idea here is we're going to continue to press price to the extent we can and market remain competitive and we believe we're well-positioned to do that in 2019. The inflation dynamic is subsiding, particularly on the materials side. That will benefit us as well. We've got a strong pipeline of productivity actions that we're going to implement. We've got some areas of opportunity for improvement. I'd call it self-help on the M&A integration that we performed lower than anticipated. And then, we've initiated some restructuring activities that will help reduce our cost base as well. So, collectively, when you add all that together, I think we're well-positioned to execute on margin improvement across all regions of the business. And I feel pretty good relative to the guide. It should help us get back to kind of the 2017 margins that we enjoyed in that year. David Petratis : Josh, I would add to that. I think I put a lot on the business in 2018. Seven acquisitions. We really pressed hard on the digitization. And as we prepare to refresh our strategic plan and went through our budgets to prepare for 2019 and really a heavy emphasis on execution and focus and I think we'll get that leverage back to our 2017 OI operating margins. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got it. Thanks for the color. I'll leave it there. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Securities Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : Yeah. Good morning, guys. David Petratis : Hey, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Hey. Just a question on cash flow. You guys are generating quite a bit of it. And I would imagine, I think, part of the debt leverage has to do with your tax structure. So, maybe you're not going to de-lever. Should we expect more emphasis on M&A because you did raise dividend very nicely, but that's still fairly small. Or how do you think about in 2019, M&A versus buybacks given where the stock price is. Thank you. Patrick Shannon : So, I would start off by saying, from a capital structure perspective, as you guys know, we ended the year in the best position since spin in terms of our leverage ratio, which provides with a lot of optionality and flexibility going forward. I just think we're well positioned there. If you look at our capital allocation strategy, three pillars \u2013 organic investments, M&A, shareholder distribution. On the organic investments, we talk about that. We're going to continue to invest in the business for opportunities that will expand our channel presence, getting more of the wallet from our distribution base, as well as the expanding new products through R&D efforts and those type of things, promotional items, demand creation. That's based in our earnings per share and we'll continue to manage that with nice earnings growth going forward. So, your question on the M&A, as Dave mentioned, we executed a lot of acquisitions in 2018. There's opportunities to continue to drive performance in those and spend maybe a little bit more time continuing to integrate those. And if you look at our history in terms of our acquisition performance, they really start to perform nicely kind of 2 to 3 years out. So, you have to look at these more on a long-term basis. And we'll continue to drive that execution. Having said that, we will continue to remain active and looking at opportunities to expand our business either through new products or geographic expansion. Our pipeline remains robust. But the key is we'll be disciplined. And we'll only do transactions that we believe will provide a good return on invested capital going forward, of course. Shareholder distribution, we're not going to hoard cash. And we've always said, we're going to utilize the capital that we generate to either do M&A or shareholder distributions through the incremental dividend. You mentioned 29% increase this year. And you can probably see it's being more active on share buyback right now. And we're going to execute our capital allocation strategy to provide the best return we can for our shareholders going forward. And that could be either M&A or shareholder distribution or a combination of those. Andrew Obin : I'll leave the question on digital strategy for the analyst day, but just a question on European growth. What would it take for Europe to get to consistent double-digit margins over time? And, I guess, EMEA. Not Europe. Sorry. David Petratis : I think continued expansion in the electronic portfolios. Extremely pleased with the SimonsVoss, Interflex performance. And I think the European market, especially in the res side of things, in its infancy, the slowest growth market. As that picks up acceleration, we think we're in a good position to benefit from that. Andrew Obin : But you don't feel like you need to scale up significantly in your sort of M&A to fill capacity? Or do you think you can get it with existing product lines? Patrick Shannon : So, I would characterize it this way. As David said, continuous improvement to get to kind of our top competitor in that market landscape would require either significant facility rationalization and/or scale, getting more back-office synergies, those type of things would certainly facilitate that. But there's opportunity for continuous improvement and we will continue to drive that. Andrew Obin : Fantastic. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Richard Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Richard Kwas : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Hey, just a clarification with regards to the electronic lock. So, 30% growth in Q3 and 7% this quarter. You referenced some weakness on the non-res side. So, was it really more the project side or the comp time? I'm a little confused because your comps have been pretty steady mid-teens, high teens over the last couple of years. So, it seemed to be more project related. Did you have some come in Q3 and then something fall out of Q4. Is that the right way to think about it? Can you clarify that? Patrick Shannon : You should think about it as project related. Remember, we put up a 30% in Q3 which was pretty impressive. The steam came out of that. I think when you think about our electronics growth, I'd look at it on multiple quarters. We continue to be at the high teens level in a market that we think is converting at maybe 7% to 8%. Richard Kwas : But the way to think about it, Q3 had some projects come in that maybe you didn't expect in Q4 had the opposite. Is that on the non-res side? Patrick Shannon : That's right. Correct. Richard Kwas : Okay. And then, just on the inflation side, so on the raw side, within finished component side, it would seem like you're going to get some tailwind here starting sometime in the first half. Is this really more a labor freight issue? That's what it sounds like. And the productivity initiatives, I imagine you're gearing it towards that. Is there some more color around that? David Petratis : So, on the inflation side, on materials specifically, commodity is kind of a mixed bag. Steel still remains higher than prior year levels. However, zinc and brass, some other major inputs into our products, lower. Collectively, Rich, we're not quite at a point right now where the year-over-year is going to show significant improvement. It's going to be more backend loaded, I would say, on materials. And then, you do have the continued inflation just on the normal operational stuff. So, think about it across the board, whether it be salaries on personnel, freight, packaging, all these type of input costs throughout the supply chain to get our product to customers. We are experiencing increased costs relative to the prior-year. So, we'll continue to manage that through cost-containment and/or driving productivity, whether it be through CapEx spending or other measures to get continued efficiencies in our manufacturing footprint. Richard Kwas : Okay. And then, one last clarification, with regards to the guide, is there a number we can think about in terms of M&A EPS contribution from 2018 into 2019? I assume it's within this $0.62 to $0.77 of operations, but just curious what you expect the 2018 acquisitions to add? Patrick Shannon : So, minimal because most of them have already lapped, okay? So, most of the acquisitions for Americas has now lapped itself. Europe, there is like a one month additional month in there. So, there's not any really incremental benefit in 2019 related to 2018 acquisitions. I think the key point to mention in the guide, it doesn't assume any additional M&A activity which would be accretive to earnings and/or share repurchase. So, it's kind of \u2013 look at it as an organic basis and that could be, if executed appropriately, some additional earnings growth. Richard Kwas : Okay, thanks. I'll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. John Walsh : Hi. Good morning. David Petratis : Good morning. John Walsh : Just wanted to get a little more color around the $0.15 of incremental investments. kind of where they live as we think about the segments. And I know you talked about broadly new product and channel initiatives, but maybe you could also specifically speak about some of those channel initiatives in residential, if that's growing a broader presence in certain retailers or how you think about those strategies? Patrick Shannon : So, the $0.15 on the incremental investment is distributed really basis of the size of the region. So, therefore, you would have a higher emphasis on investment in Americas relative to Europe and Asia. They are specific around driving new product development. So, putting more emphasis on resources and engineering to accelerate new product \u2013 get products out to the market faster. With the channel initiatives -- so think of demand creation, really trying to accelerate electronics growth, whether it be in the resi and/or non-residential segment. So, we will continue to do that. Those would be the key items. As you kind of look at phasing in 2019, little bit more front-end loaded in our plan for 2019 than what you might have historically seen. So, we'll continue to invest in the business. We believe they provide good growth opportunities, good cash on cash payback as well as return on capital. David Petratis : I would say, in terms of specific initiatives to grow in resi, more segmentation in the market. I mentioned earlier that we're picking up some wins with the big builders. We think that's driven by our electronic capabilities. Multi-family will continue to be strong in 2019. And this, again, is where electronic access is a value creator for those residential operators. And then, working with the big box in terms of point of display and inventory stocking to make sure that we've got the products on the shelves that will help pull through sales of our Schlage products. John Walsh : Got you. Thank you. And then, as a follow-up, you've talked about investments kind of being front-end loaded here. When we think about the price, cost, productivity, you mentioned that, in the back half, it kind of actually look like deflation on some of the material costs. How should we think about the quarterly cadence or the first half/second half relative to normal history? I think you normally do about 47% of your OP and EPS in the first half. Given those dynamics, should we think that that deviates a little bit or is that still the normal seasonality, is still the right way to think about the year? Patrick Shannon : Yeah. Maybe a little bit more back-end loaded, I think. It's interesting, on the growth side of things, which we get pretty good operating leverage on growth, coming out of the gate, Q1 is always a little bit lighter relative to our overall growth and then it accelerates in Q2, Q3 kind of relative to the seasonality of our business. And we saw some good acceleration in Q4. So, I would kind of think about it in the same type of pattern, but from a margin contribution perspective, with the inflation kind of subsiding more in the back end of the year, so look at a heavier mix of operational improvement in the second half relative to the first half. David Petratis : I would add to that, we are very intentional in our 2019 budgeting. I think we've got the activities that will drive margin expansion throughout the year, but the nature of it, some of these projects will go over multi quarters and will pick up momentum as the year goes on. John Walsh : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Robert Aurand : Hi. Rob Aurand on for David this morning. Can you talk about the month to month cadence of growth within the quarter? And then, I guess, coming into January, can you talk about the government shutdown? Did you see any impact from that at all? David Petratis : I'd say in terms of the month-to-month growth, we naturally slow down with the construction cycle as we go through the fourth quarter. We saw some of that. I think you also saw, particularly res, our big box partner backing off some orders because of the softness that was projected in the overall res market. Patrick Shannon : The other thing I would add, and then [indiscernible], just across the landscape of various businesses, the cold weather has impacted a little bit. We've had some occasions of factory shutdowns just because of the extreme cold temperatures in certain regions of the US. So, a little impact there as well. David Petratis : I'd say government shutdown, we were more heavily impacted by weather. When mechanical installers can't get on the jobsite, you see that. And there are parts of the country that are having some pretty tough challenges. We'll see that as it develops, but I'd hang that on weather versus the government shutdown. Robert Aurand : Okay. And then, just can you remind us about your tariff exposure and what's going into guidance? Patrick Shannon : So, all tariff exposure is built to the guidance basis of what we know today. We'll see and monitor how that develops going forward. I think you've heard us talk previously that we don't have a lot of exposure because we source, manufacture and sell pretty much in region. For products that we do import from China, to the extent that they are exposed to tariffs beginning in March, that is baked in our guidance. However, as we've indicated, we are mitigating the impact of that, either through price increase that we instituted late last year and/or productivity resourcing, those type of things, to minimize those impacts. So, all of that is baked in. So, a favorable outcome could be some upside going forward. Robert Aurand : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And the next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Hey, thank you. Good morning, everyone. David Petratis : Good morning. Jeffrey Sprague : First maybe just a housekeeping one for Patrick. Patrick, you're guiding the tax rate up year-over-year, but I think down certainly relative to what I was thinking. I'm not sure where the Street was. But the nature of my question is, we've seen a number of non-US domiciled companies here recently signaling that their tripped up on the deductibility of interest expense and are kind of suggesting their tax rates are going to be going up. It doesn't seem like that's caught you here in 2019. But do you have any color on that? And why that may or may not be impacting your situation? Patrick Shannon : Yeah. So, I can't really, obviously, comment on other companies and their particular tax situations. But maybe the general comment is relative to some of these proposed regulations that were issued at the end of the year, they are extremely complex and, as you say, can impact foreign-domiciled companies as well as multinational companies. And so, maybe your commentary is kind of caught up in that. I think there's going to be a lot of commentary and we'll see kind of where that ends up. But relative to Allegion, we've evaluated those extensively with our outside advisors. And we've made some necessary tweaks, necessary to kind of feel pretty good relative to our 16% effective tax rate guide for 2019. And we'll see where it goes going forward, but I think we're okay for 2019. And as it relates to interest deductibility relative to the US tax reform in 2017, that does impact us a little bit from a cash tax perspective and that's baked in our available cash flow numbers. So, our cash taxes, because of some of that limitation, will always be higher than our book provision. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. That's helpful. And then, you mentioned cannibalization as it relates to electronics growth. It sounds fairly obvious, right, the outgrowth you're having there. But is there anything that is starting to impact your manufacturing costs, your footprint, how your plans are lined up as this mix shifts? Anything that's disrupted the margins or is going to require restructuring, anything of size or scope that should be aware of? Patrick Shannon : I don't see that, Jeff. We've got a nice position out of the Baja that we think sets that up nicely. Our res electronics are built there and we think the superior access to market and be able to get those in production quickly really helps us. So, feel good about our position. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Hi, thank you. Good morning, guys. David Petratis : Hi, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Hey. Maybe just touching on the Americas organic guide for a second, is there a way to maybe parse that out a little bit further. So, you guys talked a little bit about softening in new construction, resi new construction. But is the expectation then that resi new is going to be down? And then, just any other color around like the different end markets and the buildup to that guide would be helpful? David Petratis : So, our view on residential new construction is softer in 2019 versus 2018. I think we mitigate that somewhat through our electronic offerings and our strong position in retrofit. As we move to the noninstitutional, we continue to see strength in the educational market, which is K-12 and college campuses. That's one of our strongholds. Two things working there. You've got continued investment in electronic conversion. We think healthcare continues to be a good opportunity for the company, not so much in the big hospitals, but in the trend to go to smaller medical suites, diagnostic center, those types of things that you see happening nationwide. And then, commercial offices continue to be okay. As I travel around the country, and I have extensively in the last 75 days, I feel a good pulse and beat in the commercial and institutional campuses, and that's reflected in how we see our growth in 2019. Joe Ritchie : Okay. That's helpful, Dave. And if I can maybe follow-up on just talking about EMEA for a second, any other additional color you can provide on QMI specifically? And as it relates to the broader margin kind of target in that business for 2019, should we expect, just like this reacceleration or improvement in margins, can we get to double digits in 2019? Just any thoughts there would be helpful. Patrick Shannon : So, obviously, the QMI performance was disappointing in the quarter. Tough market conditions. And that business is a longer-earnings process. So, think of installation work and when jobs get deferred for whatever reason, you're kind of saddled with some fixed costs that hit us in the quarter. We're taking action to mitigate some of those costs going forward and would expect sequential improvement continuous throughout the year to get back to profitability. So, that will start being reported, obviously, in base business beginning this quarter for Europe. So, think of Europe in aggregate along with the rest of the business with continuous margin improvement during the course of the year, either through better performance on this QMI business specifically and/or productivity \u2013 the price-inflation dynamic getting better. And so, you'll see us back close to that double-digit operating profit margin for the full year. Joe Ritchie : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital. Jeffrey Kessler : Thank you. Thank you for taking the question. With regard \u2013 just getting back to the institutional markets in the US and the healthcare markets, realizing that they've been in a lot of people's pipelines for long time, but nothing is really broken out yet. Does it appear to you right now that these business \u2013 that these verticals are about to accelerate in terms of your ability to \u2013 whether you're getting it from the channel or whether you're getting it directly from them, not just educational institutions, but other institutions that maybe have been part of a discussion pipeline for a while, is that pipeline about to be turned really into \"backlog\"? David Petratis : I believe, as I look at our backlog, they remain healthy. More importantly, the spec and quote remain healthy on both of these verticals. I wouldn't characterize it as an acceleration. I just think as we continue to drive portfolio expansion through new products and acquisitions like AV and TGP, as well as superior execution on working these more complex application, we tend to get more than our fair share.  And I look at these market as solid and our execution can be good and it's going to benefit us in the next 12 months. Jeffrey Kessler : A follow-up is just \u2013 against your two major competitors over in Europe, you're somewhat of a newbie with regards to the commercial door manufacturing business. Do you feel that that you've learned something on QMI or is that so much of a one-off that it is not indicative of the dynamics of the door manufacturer market, either in EMEA or in the United States? David Petratis : So, we have been in the hollow metal business since 1970. So, this is something under the Steelcraft brand. We're pretty knowledgeable of the space. I think as we moved into the Middle East and look back on that acquisition, number one, you've got market turbulence with some of the political instability in the Middle East. Number two, there was a pretty good change in the mix of business under the previous ownership that was target on prisons [ph] that moved. And then, third, you've got to be mindful \u2013 I don't care if you look at the wood or hollow metal business, these are tough areas to operate. So, we're mindful of that. We believe that the acquisition of QMI, Republic and what we've done with AV Systems, which is a sliding door capability, complements our strategy. We'll get those integrated and they'll perform to our satisfaction in the future. Jeffrey Kessler : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. So, as there are no more questions, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to return the conference back over to Michael Wagnes for any closing comments. Michael Wagnes : We'd like to thank everyone for participating in today's call. And please contact me if you have any further questions. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Mike Wagnes, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Wagnes : Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for Allegion's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. With me today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we will refer to in today's call are available on our website at allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website. Please go to Slides #2 and 3. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our most recent SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Today's presentation and commentary include non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details. Dave and Patrick will now discuss our first quarter 2019 results, which will be followed by a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]. We will do our best to get to everyone, given the time allotted. Please go to Slide 4, and I'll turn the call over to Dave. David Petratis : Thanks, Mike. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Allegion got out of the starting gate with a good quarter that has positioned us to deliver on our 2019 commitments. We had solid top line revenue growth in the first quarter, which benefited from strength in the Americas and from the Gainsborough acquisition in the Asia Pacific region. The Americas' growth was driven by the nonresidential business as end market fundamentals continue to be positive, particularly in institutional verticals. Pricing was also strong for the company, led by the Americas region. Electronics growth at almost 10% for the quarter, which was lower than the growth rates we experienced in 2018. While growth improved sequentially from the last quarter, our product portfolio and new market partnerships will drive even better growth in the coming quarters. Allegion's combination of brands, expanded product portfolio, technical partnerships and continuously evolving channel relationships give us a great opportunity to take advantage of this market as it develops. For the full year 2019, we expect the Americas electronics growth rate to be similar to historic levels, which is supported by the healthy demand of the recently launched Schlage Encode residential lock that is ramping up in Q2.  Moving down the slide, Allegion was able to drive price realization and productivity actions, which more than offset the substantial inflationary pressures we experienced. I'm pleased with the performance as we saw operating margin increase for the total company and in each of the individual regions. In the first quarter, we delivered a 10% increase of adjusted EPS, driven primarily from operations. This performance highlights our continued focus on accelerating growth, margin improvement and driving increased shareholder value. Last, we are affirming our outlooks for 2019 revenue and EPS. We project total and organic revenue growth between 5% and 6%.  For reported EPS, the range continues to be $4.60 to $4.75 per share and adjusted EPS remains at $4.75 to $4.90. Please go to Slide #5 and I'll walk through the first quarter financial summary. In Q1, Allegion delivered good top line revenue performance. Revenue for the first quarter was $655 million, an increase of 6.8%, inclusive of 5.8% organic growth.  Allegion also contributed to the top line revenue expansion -- excuse me, acquisitions also contributed to the top line revenue expansion offsetting the unfavorable currency impact. Americas led the way with organic growth of nearly 8% in the quarter, a strong pricing and solid volume in the nonresidential business. The EMEIA region saw modest organic growth and Asia Pacific total revenue was boosted by the Gainsborough acquisition completed last year. Adjusted operating margin increased by 10 basis points, aided by price and productivity more than offsetting significant inflation. The businesses continue to focus on driving price realization, productivity savings, to combat the inflationary pressures. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.88, increased $0.08 or 10% versus the prior year.  As mentioned, the increase was driven primarily by operational performance, reduced share count and a slightly lower tax rate with the other income providing the small benefit to EPS growth. Year-to-date, available cash flow is down approximately $6 million, the decrease is related to increased working capital and higher capital expenditures that were offset slightly by increased earnings. Please go to Slide 6. When Allegion was founded, we put together a sound strategy, values and strategic pillars for our company, and they have allowed us to deliver industry-leading results, including industry-leading organic growth and operating margins. As we move into the next five years, we made some nice adjustments to the strategy. In March, we shared our refresh corporate strategy with you. Our vision of seamless access in a safer world is aligned with electronic trends and security and access. It also recognized the enhanced capabilities of technology, edge devices and our unique ownership of the opening to provide layers of authentication and enhanced safety to increase human productivity. We believe the five strategic pillars Allegion has laid out are the foundation for our future. Our pillars include expansion in core markets. We continue to broaden the core business through channel relationships, digital demand creation and leading products. Being the partner of choice, delivering seamless access means we are intent on looking beyond our walls and leveraging our partners and ecosystems to drive growth, which includes using open platforms that integrate well with others. Driving value and access, our innovation will focus on the user experience with access and working with partners to create unique solutions that increase their safety and speed up their productivity. We're also intent on bringing new products to the market faster through modular, global, scalable platforms.  Capital allocation. Allegion will continue to take a disciplined and flexible approach to capital deployment one that expands organic investments, acquisitions and shareholder distributions to optimize shareholder returns. And last, enterprise excellence. As you have seen in our Q1, our ability to drive results through productivity and continuous improvement is a strength of our company. Allegion is committed to create value with excellent customer experience and with a culture of safety, health and employee engagement. Access has been a part of our company's history for over 100 years and seamless access will define our company going forward. Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2019 outlook. Patrick Shannon : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. If you would, please go to Slide #7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the first quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 5.8% organic growth in Q1. This performance reflects another strong quarter in the Americas region, which includes 7.6% organic growth, led by the nonresidential markets and returns on our channel initiatives. Pricing in the quarter was strong at 2.1%. The company will continue to take necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures. Also during the first quarter, acquisitions contributed more than 3% growth, offsetting the substantial currency headwinds we experienced. Please go to Slide #8. Reported net revenues for the first quarter were $655 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 6.8% versus the prior year, up 5.8% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $112.1 million increased nearly 8% over the same time frame from last year. Adjusted operating margin of 17.1% increased 10 basis points. Price realization and productivity actions outpaced inflation, which contributed to the operating incoming increase and solid volume leverage contributed to the margin expansion.  Headwinds to margin performance included incremental investments, which had a 40 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins and regional mix driven by acquisitions. Each of the regions saw expansion in operating margin, which offsets the corporate expense related to deferred compensation plans due to favorable financial markets and accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation for retirement-eligible employees. The incremental cost associated with deferred compensation plans will offset in other income, below operating income such as it had no impact on earnings per share. Please go to Slide #9. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter 2018, reported earnings per share was $0.75. Adjusting $0.05 for the prior year restructuring expenses and cost-related acquisitions, the Q1 2018 adjusted EPS was $0.80. Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.09 as favorable price, operating leverage on incremental volume and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts and unfavorable currency. Favorable year-over-year share count drove another $.0.01 as we executed more than $63 million in share buyback in the quarter. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.02 reduction. These incremental investments are for new product development, channel strategies and demand creation spending. Collectively, these incremental investments enable Allegion to accelerate growth, particularly in electronics. The combination of interest expense, other income, noncontrolling interest and tax rate offset each other to have no impact on year-over-year earnings per share growth. This results in adjusted first quarter 2019 earnings per share of $0.88, an increase of $0.08 or 10% compared to the prior year. Lastly, we have a $0.04 per share reduction for charges related acquisitions of restructuring. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at the first quarter 2019 reported earnings per share of $0.84. Please go to Slide #10. First quarter revenues for the Americas region were $475.3 million, up 8.2% on a reported basis and 7.6% organically. The organic growth was driven by low double-digit increase in the nonresidential business. Pricing was strong in Americas region, coming in at 2.6% in the quarter, while the nonresidential business grew nicely, the residential business was essentially flat in the quarter when compared to Q1 of last year.  Electronics growth still exceeded total growth in the Americas and came in at nearly 10%. Americas adjusted operating income of $123.1 million increased 8.5% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 10 basis points. The increase in adjusted operating margin was driven primarily by volume leverage. Additionally, price and productivity exceeded the significant inflationary pressures observed in the region and contributed to the operating income increase. Incremental investments were a 30 basis point drag on margins. Please go to Slide #11. First quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $142.9 million, down 4.9% and up 1.7% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by pricing and favorable volume in our SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses, offsetting weaknesses in Southern Europe. Total revenue growth was reduced by significant currency headwinds. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $11.7 million increased 30% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 220 basis points, driven by price and productivity exceeding moderate inflation. The region also saw volume leverage and favorable mix, which partially offset currency pressures. Incremental investments were a 30 basis point headwind operating margin. Please go to Slide #12. First quarter revenues for Asia-Pacific region were $36.8 million, up 55% versus the prior year. Organic revenue declined 2.2%, driven by an internal revenue transfer of $1.5 million to the other regions. Total revenue growth was driven by the Gainsborough acquisition, which increased revenues in the region by more than 63%. Foreign currency was a significant headwind for the quarter reducing revenue by nearly 6%. Asia-Pacific adjusted operating loss for the quarter was $0.7 million, an improvement of $0.3 million with adjusted operating margins improving 230 basis points versus the prior year period. Similar to the other regions, the price, productivity, inflation dynamic was positive in the region and the Gainsborough acquisition was accretive to operating margin in the quarter.  Please go to Slide #13. Year-to-date available cash flow for the first quarter 2019 was negative $24.9 million, which is a decrease of $6.1 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease is driven by higher working capital requirements and increased capital spending, partially offset by higher net earnings. Working capital as a percent of revenues increased slightly in the first quarter, while the cash conversion cycle was down. As always, we remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital, and will continue to evaluate opportunities to minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow.  Lastly, we are affirming our full year available cash flow outlook of $430 million to $450 million. I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2019 outlook. David Petratis : Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide #14. As noted on the slide, we are affirming our revenue outlook. The consolidated outlook for total organic revenue remains at a range of 5% to 6%. In the Americas, we see continued positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals led by institutional markets, which we believe will continue to be strong throughout 2019. We expect the general trend toward electronic progress to continue, and we are positioned to take advantage of this trend.  For the EMEIA region, we expect strength in our electronic businesses led by SimonsVoss and Interflex to more than offset weaknesses that we are experiencing in Southern Europe. However, total revenue will be negatively affected by currency headwinds. In Asia-Pacific, we continue to see healthy growth in China with softening markets in Australia and New Zealand. The total revenue growth reflects the full year impact of the Gainsborough acquisition, which has another quarter before we pass the anniversary date. We're also affirming our earnings per share outlook with reported EPS at the range of $4.60 to $4.75 per share and adjusted EPS to be between $4.75 and $4.90. This represents adjusted EPS growth of approximately 6% to 9%.  As Patrick stated, we are also affirming our cash flow outlook of $430 million to $450 million. The outlook assumes no change in the previously provided investment spend of approximately $0.15 per share. The full year adjusted effective tax rate continues to be approximately $0.16 -- 16% with an anticipated higher rate in the first half of the year than in the second half. We're updating our outlook for outstanding diluted shares to approximately $95 million, reflecting the buyback activity completed in Q1.  Please go to Slide 15. As a summary of Allegion's Q1 performance, total revenue grew nearly 7%, organic revenue grew almost 6%, adjusted operating margins were up 10 basis points, and were up in all regions. Adjusted EPS saw 10% growth in the quarter. Access has been an important part of our past and will be more important part of the future, as we connect the world through seamless access and smart devices.  Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And today's first question comes from John Walsh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Walsh : So I guess, maybe a first question here around electronics, the near almost 10% growth. I think you've been talking about sustaining a mid-teens type growth rate on an annual basis. You have another quarter here of a high teens comp. How should we think about the cadence? And maybe a little bit underneath that number between residential and nonresidential would also be helpful as well. David Petratis : I would say, continue your cadence or in terms of mid-teens growth for our electronics businesses. As I said in Investor Day, our industry was going to do well with this transformation over the next decade, feel good about the business with the launch of Encode, our partnership with Ring, the conversion of Lennar who is leading on electronics from the launch. We see that the adoption continues to be strong. We have a strong pipeline of new products and partnerships. When I see the 10% growth in the quarter, there was some work behind the scenes that we conducted in the channel that, I think, took some steam out of our sales, but will help us accelerate as we go forward. John Walsh : And, I guess, maybe can you elaborate on those actions in the channel a little bit? David Petratis : I would describe it as this. With the advent and growth of e-commerce, it can be at times a little bit of the wild west. And we went in and buttoned up some channel partners that will help us to drive price realization and growth in the marketplace. John Walsh : Got you. And then maybe just one quick one here. Nice to see the price and productivity net be a 60 basis point contributor year-on-year. How should we think about that cadence as we go through the year? Does that actually pick up? David Petratis : So as we've commented earlier, well, first of all, was very pleased with the performance in the quarter. It's good to see us turn the quarter on the price productivity inflation dynamic. As you'll recall, last year every quarter, we were a little bit under water. So we turned positive this year, particularly across all regions. So very pleased with the performance as it relates to that. As we look forward during the course of the year, you would see a -- from a margin expansion continued improvement as we progress throughout the year with the margin improvement being more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year, and that's when the comparisons on inflation become a little bit more easier, particularly as we look at input cost on steel and those type of things. So consider continued migration of margin expansion with more heavily back-end loaded in the back half of the year. Operator : And the next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : So I guess, thinking back on 1Q, it seems like every company we've heard from so far has had some mix of inventory and weather discussions. So just wondering as it pertains to residential where the mechanical side looks like it was probably a little bit weaker. Anything that you saw from weather or channel destocking that makes that kind of a less of a trend line and something you can accelerate or at least improve a little bit from here? David Petratis : I would say, first, look at the macro. We see the renovation of retrofit softened in the quarter. I think you see overall starts down or at least softened, not surprising, I think, again. Third, there are some pretty big players in retail, that have year-ends that tends to wind down the inventory. And then it was a pretty tough winter. I don't like to point at that, but especially in res, north of the Mason\u2013Dixon line people generally don't go out and replace their front door locks when it's below 0. So I think there was a lot of things working in that. Overall, I think we performed pretty well in the quarter with some of those stressors. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the price mix in Americas. I think that's the high water marks that we haven't hit in sometime. Just understanding that mix was probably particularly solid given resi versus non-resi and electronics, which probably could have been a little bit better to your earlier point. How should we think about how that paces through the rest of the year? Should that price mix number start to moderate as you lap some of the increases last year? David Petratis : Yes. So you would expect to see kind of a similar type of dynamic maybe for Q2. And then, as you said, the price increase implemented last year beginning of Q2, so that laps beginning -- beginning of Q3, so that laps in Q3. And the price increase that we're going out with this year isn't of the same magnitude. And so therefore, the price increase year-over-year becomes less in the back half of the year. Operator : And the next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just a first question on your residential business. So, as you said, this is the second quarter in a row of sort of no growth really, a lot of issues in the broader market and also weather. Maybe just update us on what you're expecting your residential business to grow in 2019? And what sort of impact do you think we could see from electronics products within that? And whether there has been any evidence of demand destruction from price increases? David Petratis : So we don't split out the overall residential growth. I think, as you look at the macro on new build, I think, we're going to continue for single family in North America around 850, a relatively flat market. I think multifamily continues to be robust, that surprises me, but people are moving into the inner cities. These projects tend to be more price competitive, especially on the traditional mechanical hardware. We do like the trend that these are becoming more electronic. We have, over the last 2 years, had a focused effort around this, and we think it will give us some lift. The strength of our company continues to be on the retrofit fit side of this. So I like our opportunities as we go into res, and it will advance -- our growth will advance beyond what we saw in Q1. Patrick Shannon : Let me just add too on the price perspective, as it relates to residential. It has been a little choppy, not in the sale to price through the distribution channel but more on the rebate side and discounts and those type of things. We actually had positive price realization in Q1 this year as it relates to residential. So there is no deterioration, if you will, in the pricing dynamics and what's going on in the marketplace, and believe we can continue to hold our own particularly as it relates to some of our new electronic products, and I think we'll be, continue to be extremely competitive there. Julian Mitchell : And then my second question just on those Americas margins, it was good to see the slight increase year-on-year in the first quarter. Based on your comments around productivity efforts in the margin bridge and also acquisition impacts, should we see that, that margin expansion accelerates through the year? And what kind of headwinds from M&A on margin do you expect in Americas? Patrick Shannon : So we would continue to see expansion throughout the course of the year, again the back half will be, a wider gap there, more favorable than Q2. M&A, as we've indicated, historically, the businesses we acquired, we like very much. We will continue to drive improvement as they become part of the Allegion business operating system and continue to drive synergies on both the top end and the cost side. Those businesses though, when we acquire, had a lower-margin profile. And therefore, by nature they are dilutive to the Americas margin, but we'll continue to get improvement in those businesses and that will help margin performance year-over-year comparisons going forward. Operator : And the next question comes from Deepa Rahgavan with Wells Fargo Securities. Deepa Raghavan : So my question is on the guide, year 2019. There is not much we can glean from this unchanged full year guide. There seems to be some cross-wind; Europe is softer obviously; North America holding better than we thought; Asia, maybe okay there. But let me ask you this way, does the guide at midpoint, say, $4.82 EPS or organic growth of 5.5% for the full year. Does that feel bolstered now where you stand post Q1? Or is it just stable at this point in time, which is what you were thinking prior? Patrick Shannon : Well, pretty stable, I would say, based on the performance, pretty much in line with what we were expecting. So therefore, you don't really see an uptick relative to the guide. So feel pretty good where we are, and our execution and basis of what Dave indicated the demand, particularly in institutional markets going forward, feel really good about that and feel like we've got good visibility to execute on our guidance for 2019. David Petratis : Deepa, I would add to that. I'd just say confident now of what we see coming out of Q1. I feel that 90, 120 days ago, a lot of uncertainty about what was going to unfold in '19. And my message to the Street is confidence. We see good solid end markets, as I travel really globally, there is opportunity for Allegion. And as I think about the electronic convergence, I like what I see ahead in 2019. Deepa Raghavan : Got it. My follow on is on Q2. Is there any quirkiness either on year-on-year basis or sequentially or comp wise we should be mindful of? Patrick Shannon : Nothing comes to mind out of the ordinary. Other than maybe below-the-line items, you're going to see some pressure as it relates to other income expense and then the tax rate, I believe, was anticipated to be higher. Operator : And the next question is from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Congratulations on the quarter. Just looking at the Americas non-residential business, the low double-digit growth, is there any way you can separate out institutional versus commercial for us there? David Petratis : We don't. I would say, as I look at our execution in those markets, we continue to perform at a high level. I think, that's reflected in the number. We see strength in the institutionals especially around K through 12 and college campuses. But as I look at those segments, I think, we see the electronic trends that are driving us, things like Overtur that we've rolled out help us to better connect with specifiers and contractors to drive that growth. And I think fundamentally, the market is strong and we're executing at a very good level. David MacGregor : Okay. And, I guess, just as a follow-up. Just talk about the electronics business and the profitability there. Any notable change in terms of the profitability of that business, it sounds like maybe there were some investments this quarter in the residential electronics? Just how should we think about the profitability? And then how you're thinking about that as it extends to the balance of the year? Patrick Shannon : So profitability really similar to prior years as we've indicated similar margin profile, but a higher ASP meaning more EBIT dollars. And so this whole trend of electronics growth really positive for Allegion and will continue. There is nothing in the horizon that would suggest any margin deterioration, relative to the new products we've introduced, similar margin profiles, and we believe we can sustain that going forward. David MacGregor : Patrick, as the new product cadence accelerates, does that profitability improve? Or how should we think about that? Patrick Shannon : No. Similar margin profile. David Petratis : As we think about that pipeline of new electronic products, our desire is to use design innovation, standardization of global platforms to be able to maintain that margin profile. Operator : And the next question comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital. Jeffrey Kessler : First question is, this year or over the last 1.5 year, we've seen an acceleration in companies that have been doing, let's call it, enhanced card access, companies like you just mentioned like one, Identiv, but some of them compete with you on card access, some of them have things that are actually outside of what you've been doing. Are you looking at expanding into that business a little bit further? And I'm not just talking about generic card access, I'm talking about card access that actually has permissions on it that gets you in, that has some maybe federal attachments to it. I know you're mostly commercial, but there are other vertical markets that the entire access business gets involved with and brings in -- involves new technologies like audio over IT, things like that. So the question -- the bottom line question is, are there card access areas that interest you to expand the business in that area? David Petratis : I think a couple of ways we think about that. Number 1, with acquisition, ISONAS was part of that. We think we got some nice IP and capabilities. I think second partnerships, I am really excited with our venture group and potential partners and new technologies that walk through. And I think partnership is not a bad place to position. I also think edge devices will also be with layers of authenticity, will be an important part of that equation to be able to drive access through cards and readers. Jeffrey Kessler : Okay. Quickly on Overtur. I'm just wondering if you're thinking about Overtur as a service, the fact that you can now have a collaborative capability that brings in a number of parties, which really does, I think, create some value added to your ability to bring a group of people to design something and help you get that product out faster. Is there a way to make that some type of a service or other parts of Allegion a service subscription -- subscription but, yes a service, I would call recurring revenue subscription-based way to get involved in working with Allegion in some way, shape or form, if something like Overtur becomes ubiquitous? David Petratis : So the answer would be, yes. However, our first priority is to make sure the user satisfaction and adoption is at a high level. So why would my answer would be, yes? I think as you think about institutional campus, a hospital, K-12 schools, the ability to digitally capture access, workflows and keep that updated is attractive to an operator of that hospital or college campus. Think about the system Overtur keeps those things current, it's not easy for a campus administrator to go out and access those multiple documents would be one example. Another is what's installed on that door as the potential is needed for service in a variety of areas. So I'd say, we're trying to stretch our thinking of what the possibilities of digital systems like Overtur can mean to the business, and I think it's -- there is positive opportunity as we go forward, Joe. Jeffrey Kessler : I'm just kind of following up. You have futurists who work with you and who are working beside you, and I think there is a lot of things that they can think about right now with given the base -- the broader base of your products and if something like this were to get a higher -- a very high user rate, you could probably move forward with a recurring revenue type of program. David Petratis : I hope all of our listeners will take a look at our Investor Day presentations and our view on seamless access. There is great opportunities for us to redefine our industry and develop new ecosystems that will benefit Allegion in a variety of ways beyond Overtur, and we are excited about it. Operator : And the next question comes from Josh Chan with Baird. Josh Chan : My first question is on the non-res business in the Americas, growth is obviously very strong. Just wondering, you talked about visibility through the whole year. Just kind of could you give us some color in terms of what you're hearing from the channel or contractor backlogs or anything like that, that kind of lends you that confidence regarding growth for the rest of the year? David Petratis : So contractor backlogs close to 9 months, historically that's extremely healthy. I think, we continue to see -- labor in the construction markets is tight. I think that continues to snowplough as you heard me say. I think the adoption of electronics continues to be an attractive trend. You get into the K-12 opportunity, bond issuance is on the rise. And the other one that a little bit more sobering, the average age of a K-12 school is 40 years old. And the need for upgrade with the opportunity or drive around campus security continue to be good for our business. You move over to healthcare, we see some softening in the big hospitals, but we see uptick around what we call medical offices and specialty clinics. There is a repositioning here, but these medical clinics still drive the same complexity of code and specification, product enhancements that we think drive growth. And for me as well, the commercial market continues to have legs, so we like the overall view, we think things like Overtur, our spec writing capability and then adding electronics bode well for 2019. Patrick Shannon : And then, Josh, just as an add on. Some of our leading indicators, so big code activities, specifications written, those type of things, very strong, trend continues to be up. And normally, there is a lag obviously between the time you get those and when the products are put in place. So feel really good relative to the market demand and the feedback we get from our customer base. Josh Chan : And then my second question is on the buyback. It seems like the pace in Q1 was maybe slightly above what you normally do in Q1. So just wondering if buybacks are -- is this more of a focus this year than in the prior years? Patrick Shannon : Well, we indicated during our Shareholder Day, capital allocation is the key strategic pillar for the company. As you know, we are in a really good financial position. Our balance sheet is the healthiest it's been since then, with a 2x debt-to-EBITDA, cash flow will continue to increase as our business grows and expands. So we have a lot of optionality and the key message is, we're going to deploy capital, put it to use for our shareholders to drive shareholder returns. Last year, as you know, we're extremely busy and adding some really good businesses to the portfolio. We're still integrating those. Our pipeline from an M&A perspective remain active and busy. We'll remain disciplined, but if we're not active in M&A, we've always said, we would provide incremental shareholder distributions either through dividends or share repurchases. You saw the dividend increase executed in Q1. So we're more active now in share repurchase. We have available cash to put it to use, and we'll continue to do so. Operator : And the next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Dave you've became a friend, my friends typically will refer to me by both names. I don't know why, but it's been a trait since I've been in high school. Anyhow, going off on a tangent. The question I have is really regarding trends. So if we think about the first quarter, we've heard like a varying degrees of trends throughout the quarter, because of weather, because of tariffs. And I'm just wondering as you guys progress through the quarter, how did your trends either improve or decelerate as we move through the quarter? David Petratis : I think there was a vulnerable flaw in the year that was called the government shutdown. I think, clearly, as we went through the quarter, things got better. And it's always -- there is a hangover after the New Years, things pick up, but felt good with the momentum. I felt better about our execution on price and productivity. We put up, I thought, an aggressive 2019 plan with margin expansion, and I was very pleased with our ability not only to put up good organic growth, but more pleased by our execution on the price and productivity side. Joseph Ritchie : But I guess, specifically though, Dave, I mean as we kind of progress through March, did things get any better? Did they get worse? Like how did things progress? David Petratis : As we went through March, and it's normal with the thawing of the ground, things get better. That's happened for the last 38 years in my exposure to building products. And in my mind, it's just a part of the spring routine, it gets better. Joseph Ritchie : That's helpful. And if I could just kind of follow on, on your investment spending. I saw that you did $0.02 this quarter, still looking to do about $0.15 for the year. And so how does the -- Patrick, how does the cadence come through for the rest of the year on the investments? And perhaps maybe some color around the investments that you're doing for the rest of the year? Patrick Shannon : So obviously it's going to pick up here, think heavily weighted towards the back half of the year, which kind of matches our improvement and margin expansion. The incremental investments or the same kind of criteria, new product developments or acceleration of products, particularly around electronics, feel like we're getting really good demand from those going forward. Channel development, continued investment in the channel, underserved market opportunities around the globe, we'll continue to do that. And then demand creation as related to trying to accelerate adoption, centered around electronics. Those are kind of the 3 primary categories, all kind of front-end loaded in terms of revenue, driving growth and we'll continue to do that and again it will expand during the course of the year. Operator : And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to return the call to Mike Wagnes for any closing remarks. Michael Wagnes : We would like to thank everyone for participating in today's call. Please contact me for any further questions, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Please go to Slide 4, and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave. Dave Petratis : Thanks, Mike. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We had modest top line revenue growth in the second quarter, and we saw strength in our Americas nonresidential business. Our residential business in the Americas was flat driven by challenging new construction markets. We also experienced currency pressures in our European and Asian businesses. Although our Americas business growth was lower sequentially in the second quarter, overall growth in the first half of the year was strong at 5.7%. As we look to the remainder of the year, we continue to see healthy end markets in our nonresidential business, particularly in institutional verticals. We believe we are positioned well to take advantage of these healthy markets in the second half of 2019. We also expect that residential markets should start to improve versus what we have seen in the first half of the year. Americas electronics growth was approximately 9% for the quarter, which was slightly lower than our historical growth rates. Our electronic growth for the quarter was negatively impacted by a slower-than-expected ramp-up in the new residential construction market and focused channel actions that we started in Q1 to drive more consistency and better alignment with our existing partners. We believe that with these efforts now complete, we are positioned nicely and expect to accelerate electronics growth during the remainder of the year. This is further supported by the healthy demand for the recently launched Schlage Encode residential lock, renewed efforts with existing partners and the benefit of new partners including Lennar. Allegion\u2019s combination of brands, expanded product portfolio, technical partnerships, breadth of channel relationships and a large installed base provide us a great opportunity to take advantage of the electronics market as it continues to evolve and grow. Moving now the Slide, Allegion was able to drive price realization and productivity actions, which more than offset the inflationary pressures we experienced. I\u2019m pleased with the performance as we saw operating margin increase again this quarter. During the quarter, the company closed its production facility in Turkey. Some products formerly produced at this site for brands in the EMEIA region are in the process of being transferred to other manufacturing locations in Europe. We continuously look for ways to improve Allegion\u2019s supply chain. This action will help us to streamline our operational footprint in Europe, which is necessary to maintain sustainable and profitable long-term growth in the region. It\u2019s also a normal part of our enterprise excellence strategy focused on driving cost competitive positions in all elements of our supply chain. In the second quarter, we delivered a slight increase in adjusted EPS driven primarily from operations, which was offset by unfavorable comparables in other income and the tax rate. We\u2019re updating the full year revenue outlook. We are now projecting total and organic revenue growth between 4.5% and 5.5%. I\u2019ll speak to the individual regions later in the presentation. Lastly, we are lowering the outlook for reported EPS to a range of $4.50 to $4.65 per share down from $4.60 to $4.75 reflecting the impact of the exiting of the Turkey operations. We are also tightening the range and raising the midpoint for 2019 adjusted EPS outlook from a range of $4.75 to $4.90 per share to a revised outlook of $4.80 to $4.90 per share. Please go to Slide 5, and I\u2019ll walk you through the second quarter financial summary. Revenue for the second quarter was $731.2 million, an increase of 3.8% inclusive of 3% organic growth. Acquisitions contributed to the top line revenue expansion offsetting the unfavorable currency impact. Americas organic growth came in at 3.3% in the quarter driven by strong price realization. The EMEIA region saw modest organic growth, and Asia-Pacific total revenue was boosted by the Gainsborough acquisition completed last year. Adjusted operating margin increased by 20 basis points, aided by price and productivity, which more than offset inflation. The businesses continue to focus on driving price realization and productivity savings to combat inflationary pressures. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.26, increased by $0.01 versus the prior year. As mentioned, the increase was driven primarily by operational performance offset by unfavorable comparables in other income and the tax rate. Year-to-date available cash flow is down approximately $20 million. The decrease in cash is related to increased capital expenditures and increased working capital to build inventory in advance of the Turkey plant closure. Please go to Slide 6. In March, we shared our refreshed corporate strategy with you, and we touched on it again in our first quarter call. We\u2019ve chosen to include it again this quarter to highlight our belief that the five strategic pillars that Allegion has laid out are the foundation of our future. The pillars that guide Allegion are; expanding core markets, we continue to broaden the core business through existing and new channel relationships, digital demand creation and leading products. To be the partner of choice, delivering seamless access means we\u2019re intent on looking beyond our walls and leveraging our partners and ecosystems to drive growth, which includes using open platforms to integrate well with others. Delivering new value and access, our innovation will focus on the user experience for access as well as working with partners to create unique solutions that increase safety and speed up productivity, we are also intent on bringing new products to market faster. Capital allocation. Allegion will continue to take a disciplined and flexible approach to capital deployment, one that spans organic investments, acquisitions and shareholder distributions to optimize shareholder returns. Last, enterprise excellence. Allegion is committed to creating value through productivity, through excellent customer experience and through a culture of safety, health and employee engagement. Access has been a part of our company\u2019s history from 100 years and seamless access will define our company going forward. Please go to Slide 7. With this continued focus on Allegion\u2019s strategic pillars that support our vision and growth strategy, we are excited about the partnership opportunities for the Connected Home. To us, this means being recognized as experts with innovative products in open standards, ultimately allowing for seamless integration with best-in-class players. You might remember from our Investor Day event that we showcased a variety of our partners for the U.S. residential market, again highlighted on this slide. Our strong presence with retailers, e-commerce and home builders position us well in the Connected Home space. Schlage Encode, our first ever Wi-Fi enabled Deadbolt is providing \u2013 is proving to be an essential part of our portfolio and working with our partners. Schlage Encode was launched in late Q1, works directly with the Key by Amazon app and Ring devices and is a market-leading part of the Schlage home experience. It will also be part of the Lennar standard home automation offering. Our work with these partners through innovations like Schlage Encode is a prime example of how we will increase electronic adoptions in the residential market space. In addition to accelerating electronic adoptions, strategic partnerships will continue to help drive our vision of seamless access in a safer world. Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I\u2019ll be back to discuss the full year 2019 outlook. Patrick Shannon : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call today. Please go to Slide 8. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the second quarter. I\u2019ll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 3% organic growth in the second quarter. Strong price realization of 2.2% drove the organic increase this quarter. The company will continue to take necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of inflationary pressures moving forward. Also during the second quarter, acquisitions contributed more than 2% growth offsetting the substantial currency headwinds we experienced in both the EMEIA and Asia Pacific regions. Please go to Slide number 9. Reported net revenues for the second quarter were $731.2 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 3.8% versus the prior year, up 3% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $157.3 million, increased nearly 5% over the same timeframe last year. Adjusted operating margin of 21.5% increased 20 basis points. Price realization and productivity actions outpaced inflation, which contributed to the operating income increase. Leverage on the incremental volume also contributed to the margin expansion. Headwinds to margin performance included incremental investments, which had a 70 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins and regional mix driven by acquisitions. Please go to Slide number 10. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter of 2018, reported earnings per share was $1.19. Adjusting $0.06 for the prior year restructuring expenses and cost related to acquisitions, the Q2 2018 adjusted earnings per share was $1.25. Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.10 as favorable price, productivity and operating leverage on incremental volume more than offset inflationary impacts and unfavorable currency. Favorable year-over-year share count drove another $0.01 increase as we executed nearly $70 million in share buyback in the quarter. The combination of interest expense, other expense and noncontrolling interest drove a $0.02 reduction, which is mostly impacted by favorable other income in 2018 that did not repeat. The year-over-year increase in the tax rate had a $0.04 unfavorable impact primarily driven by the unfavorable mix of income earned in higher tax rate jurisdictions. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.04 reduction. These incremental investments are for new product development, channel strategies and demand creation spending. This resulted in adjusted second quarter 2019 earnings per share of $1.26, an increase of $0.01 compared to the prior year. Lastly, we had a $0.10 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring and acquisitions. After giving effect to these onetime items, you arrive at the second quarter 2019 reported earnings per share of $1.16. Please go to Slide number 11. Second quarter revenues for the Americas region were $545.1 million, up 3.5% on a reported basis and 3.3% organically. The organic growth was driven by strong price realization of 2.5%. When compared to Q2 of last year, we experienced mid-single digit growth in the nonresidential business and residential was essentially flat. Electronics growth still exceeded total growth in the Americas region coming in at approximately 9%. On a year-to-date basis, the Americas has delivered total growth of 5.7% and organic growth of 5.3%. Americas adjusted operating income of $162.4 million increased 4.2% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 20 basis points. The increase in adjusted operating margin was driven primarily by price and productivity exceeding inflation. Additionally, leverage on the incremental volumes contributed to the increase. Inflationary pressures are expected to ease during the second half of 2019. Combined with our pipeline of the productivity actions, this should position us for increased margin expansion throughout the remainder of the year. Incremental investments were a 60 basis points decrease on operating margins. Please go to Slide number 12. Second quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $142.2 million, down 3.8% and up 1.7% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven primarily by pricing and favorable volume in our portable security, SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses, offsetting weakness in Southern Europe. Total revenue growth was reduced by significant currency headwinds. As Dave mentioned earlier on the call, during the quarter we closed our manufacturing operations in Turkey. There was minimal impact to revenue and adjusted operating income in the quarter. Dave will discuss the full year impacts related to this closure when he discusses the outlook later in the call. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $11.4 million decreased 5.8% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 20 basis points. Excluding currency impacts, the region would have seen a 10 basis point increase in margins driven by price and productivity exceeding inflation. Incremental investments were a 60 basis point headwind to operating margin. Please go to Slide number 13. Second quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $43.9 million, up 45.8% versus the prior year. Organic revenue increased 4.7%. Total revenue growth was driven by the Gainsborough acquisition, which increased revenues in the region by more than 47%. Foreign currency was a significant headwind for the quarter reducing revenue by more than 6%. Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $1.8 million, an increase of $1 million with adjusted operating margins improving 140 basis points versus the prior year period. Similar to the other regions, the price, productivity and inflation dynamic was positive in the region. Incremental investments were a 140 basis point decline on adjusted operating margins. We are pleased with the continued progress in the Asia Pacific region as the strategy and restructuring initiatives begin to drive operational improvements. Please go to Slide number 14. Year-to-date available cash flow for the second quarter 2019 was $77.7 million, which is a decrease of $20.1 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease is driven by increased capital spending and higher working capital requirements to build inventory in advance of the Turkey plant closure. Working capital as a percent of revenues increased slightly in the second quarter and the cash conversion cycle was also slightly higher. We continue to remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital, and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate opportunities to both minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow. Lastly, we are updating our full year available cash flow outlook to a range of $410 million to $430 million. Reduction from the prior outlook is inclusive of the closure of operations in Turkey. I\u2019ll now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2019 outlook. Dave Petratis : Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide 15. As can be seen on the slide and was mentioned earlier, we are updating our revenue outlook. The consolidated outlook for total organic revenue is now at a range of 4.5% to 5.5%. In the Americas, we see continued positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals led by institutional markets, which we believe will remain strong throughout 2019. In residential, we expect markets to improve versus what we experienced in the first half of the year. In addition, we expect the general positive trend for electronic products to continue for the foreseeable future and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this long-term trend. For the European region, we expect continued strength in our electronic business led by SimonsVoss and Interflex. We expect this will more than offset weaknesses we are experiencing in Southern Europe leading to positive organic growth for the region. However, total revenue will be negatively impacted by currency headwinds. In addition, we have reduced our revenue outlook for the EMEIA region to account for the impacts of our decision to exit operations in Turkey. In Asia Pacific, we continue to see healthy growth in China with softening markets in Australia and New Zealand, particularly around residential end markets. The total revenue outlook reflects the full year impact of the Gainsborough acquisition, which passed its one-year anniversary on June 30. We are also updating our earnings per share outlook with reported EPS at a range of $4.50 to $4.65 per share and adjusted EPS to be between $4.80 and $4.90. This represents adjusted EPS growth of approximately 7% to 9%. As Patrick stated, we are updating our cash flow outlook to a range of $410 million to $430 million with the reduction from prior outlook inclusive of our closure of our Turkey operations. The outlook assumes no change in the previous \u2013 in previously provided investment spend of approximately $0.15 per share. The full year adjusted effective tax rate continues to be approximately 16%. We are updating our outlook for outstanding diluted shares to approximately 94 million, reflecting the buyback activity completed during the first half of the year and including expected share repurchases for the back half of 2019. The closure of our Turkey operations is expected to have $0.14 to $0.17 impact on the reported EPS, some of which has been seen in Q2 and a $0.02 impact to adjusted EPS in the third quarter. Please go to Slide 16. A brief summary of Allegion\u2019s Q2 performance. Total revenue grew 3.8% in the quarter and 5.2% year-to-date. Organic revenue growth grew 3% in Q2 and 4.3% year-to-date. Adjusted operating margins were up 20 basis points. Adjusted EPS was up slightly. Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Yes, thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning, guys. Dave Petratis : Hey, Josh. Joshua Pokrzywinski : So Dave, just back on some of the channel strategies or some of the moves that you made in residential to punch up growth a little bit. And I guess, this is the question the follow-up wrapped up in one. What did that cost you in the quarter? How should we think about that as a driver of the acceleration in the back half? And what were those moves specifically? Dave Petratis : So the channel plays that we addressed was really what I\u2019d call maintenance. As we have expanded rapidly especially through e-commerce, there was some clean-up that we needed to go do and \u2013 to protect ourselves on pricing. It clearly was reflected in our electronics growth, particularly residential in Q2. We think that\u2019s behind us. I\u2019d say in an overall backdrop, particularly in resi, we thought the channel would perform better in new construction. I think it\u2019s pretty widely seen that there were some challenges in new construction including we expected acceleration with Lennar. That\u2019s progressing, but those were the factors that we went in and worked, and we think it positions us nicely for the second half. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Any numbers that you can share around what you think that costs and what you think that adds going forward? Dave Petratis : I think the numbers are out there in total. Don\u2019t want to get into the specifics of it. But the work is behind us and you\u2019ll see that performance improve in the second half. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Okay, thanks for the color. Dave Petratis : Thanks Josh. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities. Deepa Raghavan : Good morning, all. Two questions for me. Looks like your second half margin assumptions are a little better than some of us are expecting. Can you provide some color on what the expectations are for price realization in the second half? Is that going to be at a 2% run rate for the full year? Also can you parse that out between resi pricing and the Q1 was positive, but demand continues to be flattish there. So how does that compare resi pricing versus nonresi pricing? And then I have a follow-up. Patrick Shannon : Yes. So on the pricing front, as indicated in our comments, really strong price realization in Q2. And just remember relative to our pricing actions, you may recall last year, we implemented the price increase in beginning of July. This year, we pulled it forward to May. So in effect, you had the impact of two price increases for this quarter year-over-year. So that\u2019s why sequentially and for the quarter year-over-year, you had really strong price realization. As we look forward to the second half, we still anticipate good price realization but sequentially will be down relative to what you saw in Q2. You\u2019re probably looking at an overall impact, we\u2019ll call it around 1.5% kind of going forward. As it relates to the nonresi, resi area in terms of pricing, most of the price realization is coming from nonresidential markets given the strength there and our ability to pass it on to offset inflationary headwinds. So we will continue to see that. You may recall last year, we had some choppiness in the residential segment associated with pricing as related to rebates, promotions, those types of things. A lot of that is subsided, and I\u2019d say as anticipated kind of a flattish pricing environment as it relates to residential and to the extent, we can push, we will, but it\u2019s improvement on a net basis after taking into consideration some of those promos and rebates. Deepa Raghavan : Got it. So it looks like you\u2019re not necessarily concerned about nonresi at all even though some of the recent data points like ABI came in a little anemic. Just can you talk to the momentum there in nonresi here in the U.S., specifically institutional? Is that your backlog visibility to end of the year that gives you the confidence that your organic growth in the second half can actually pick up? Thank you. Dave Petratis : Our backlog visibility is clear, in particular with the commercial institutional backlog. Remember those are long-cycle projects. And we feel very good about the book backlog that\u2019s on the business. I think the other thing that\u2019s important is long-term trends, particularly in the institutional markets, upgrades of schools, college campuses for higher security needs continue. Today, I\u2019ll speak to the Iowa Board of Trustees on campus security. It continues to be a trend. I think we continue to see positives in the hospital segments, and we like our backlog and opportunities going forward. Patrick Shannon : I would just also add Deepa that some of the leading indicators that we look relative to our business is, well, it\u2019s kind of macro items. The order, bid quote activity, specification writing continues to be positive, trending upward. And so that\u2019s always a good indicator in terms of business down the road. Also from a macro perspective and you look at some of the things, for example, the number of on-referendums, particularly in institutional market continues to remain strong. The construction backlog also is at a healthy level. Some of the things, the job openings in the construction markets continue to be very healthy. And so all these things would indicate that market demand continues to remain strong and as Dave indicated particularly in the institutional segment where we have obviously a strong market position and it\u2019s a richer mix of products in our business, which helps us on the margin profile as well. Deepa Raghavan : Great, color. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. Good morning. May be just following up, I was particularly interested in what you\u2019re seeing in the commercial markets in Americas nonres. And maybe just help me understand a little bit more clearly what drove that slowdown in the nonres growth in Q2? Was it something that happened late in the quarter? Does it just go back to some of those labor shortages you talked about? Or have you seen some of your commercial customers may be pushing some orders or projects to the right because of macro factors rather than labor shortages? Dave Petratis : I think if you look at just pure commercial construction, there continues to be a healthy environment. We obviously like the institutional college campuses more, but as I travel around the nations, you see commercial certainly at its maximum development and output. With that said, in the upper parts of the Midwest, it was extremely wet, that the ways construction activity, shortages of labor, I think, are rapid. We see labor tightness as high as it\u2019s ever been since 2008. So we think those factors actually snowplough the length of job. We also see some tightness and extended lead time in door availability, which impact our ability to drive business through. But with that said, overall health of the commercial and institutional part of the market driven by spec, quote and backlog continues to be favorable for Allegion. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. And then just my second question maybe switching to the EMEIA region. Maybe help us understand a little bit of context around the Turkey plant closure. Understood that there were some specific macro and economic issues in that country over the last couple of years, in particular, the extent to which those played into the plant decision versus just an overall look at your EMEIA regional capacity and trying to get that capacity down maybe. And how happy you feel now post the Turkey plant shutdown regarding your EMEIA footprint? Dave Petratis : So never happy with any of our footprints till it\u2019s fully optimized. So globally, we continue to work. I think, second, I\u2019d remind you that a lot of our acquisition activity has been in Europe. As we brought on new capacity, we felt the opportunity to optimize that was there. Turkey also from \u2013 on macro and political standpoint, a lot of pressure there. And at the end of the day, we thought that the best move from \u2013 to Allegion was to consolidate that and we\u2019ve executed that at a very good level. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of our teams to go and make that move. I think overall our view in Europe is to continue to optimize that footprint to continue to improve our profitability and ability to serve the customer in the region. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. John Walsh : Hi. Good morning. Dave Petratis : Good morning. John Walsh : Maybe the follow-up first. Just wanted to better understand the electronics acceleration in the Americas you\u2019re talking about in the back half. Just looking at Q3, you obviously have a very difficult compare. Should we expect that to happen as early as the current quarter? Or is it more of a back half commentary about trends just given how it can be kind of lumpy? Patrick Shannon : So you will see improved electronics growth sequentially relative to where we were in the first half of the year beginning in Q3. But given the tough comp in Q3 last year, more of it perhaps weighted in Q4. And a lot of that growth associated with some of our \u2013 what Dave talked about in terms of the channel activities that we have now completed, that\u2019s behind us. This new arrangement with Lennar will begin to continue to drive traction there and our Encode product continues to sell through extremely well. So we see continued growth in there. So those three activities will boost the electronics growth, particularly in the residential side, and commercial still remains healthy. And we have a good backlog of activities and channel partners that will drive that going forward as well. John Walsh : Great. And then you talked about the channel with e-commerce. How about Big Box? I mean it was a different product category, but we have heard destocking there. Anything to call out there that would have impacted residential in the quarter? Dave Petratis : I would say the Big Box channel was sluggish, and we expect performance improvement in the second half. I think the Schlage Encode and our strength, Allegion through our Schlage brand and Big Box still have the highest-rated products available. Our partnerships with Ring, Apple, Amazon and those integrations, I think, make a great choice for consumers. And we expect to improve performance in the second half. John Walsh : Great. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Tim Wojs : Hey, guys. Good morning. Dave Petratis : Good morning. Tim Wojs : So maybe just on Americas margin in the back half of the year, I think just kind of doing some math here, maybe we are looking at an acceleration in the margin improvement from up of 20 basis points in the first half to may be something like up 100 in the back half. And just kind of wondering how much of that do you expect to be driven by just kind of improving price cost? And how much of that should be driven by just core operating leverage? Patrick Shannon : So those are the two primary components that will drive operating margin accretion in the second half. Feel really good about where we are as we look forward to those opportunities. The price, productivity, inflation dynamic will continue to improve there. So recall relative to the inflation we are getting to easier comps starting here in Q3 as it relates to commodity cost and then pricing and that type of thing. And you may recall our methodology is try to hedge inflation in terms of \u2013 not financial hedges but contracts with suppliers. So we lock into prices on an outward to 12 months. And as inflation subsides, we see that perhaps later than other people might. So we\u2019re going to start reaping the benefits in the second half as it relates to the reduction in commodity costs. That can be a big driver. And then the continued volume leverage and the margin accretion associated with that is a big driver as well. And we had a couple of one-off type of things that are nonrecurring as well. So that collectively will serve to improve the operating margin performance. And I\u2019d just say as a collective company for the full year and we communicated this at the beginning of the year, the objective is to get close to 100 basis points improvement for the full year, which gets us back to kind of like the 2017 levels and still feel like we have good visibility to that relative to the improvement in the price, productivity, inflation dynamic as well as the leverage on the incremental volume. Tim Wojs : Okay. Great. Dave Petratis : I would add Tim that we were pretty clear that we would create a faster dynamic in the second half. I was extremely pleased with how we drove the equation in the first half. And I think we\u2019re set up nicely with identifiable projects that will help us achieve our goal. Tim Wojs : Great. Okay. And just in a more deflationary environment, I just want to make sure I\u2019m thinking about pricing the right way. You should be able to kind of in your \u2013 every year be able to get some modest price realization, but in an environment with lower raw material cost, that traction is probably towards the lower end of your historical range, right? Patrick Shannon : So as you know, we have the ability to pass on price whether in an inflationary period or deflationary environment. We\u2019ve been fairly successful in doing that. And we\u2019ll continue to remain competitive and push that where we can. So this year for example, the gross price increase was lower than last year and last year being the higher inflation period. But on a normalized level, we should always get 1% to 1.5% of price increase across the business. Tim Wojs : Okay. Okay, great. I will hop back. Thanks, guys. Operator : And the next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Thanks, Good morning, everyone. Dave Petratis : Okay, Joe. Joe Ritchie : So just thinking about the growth for the back half of the year again in the Americas. I think this past quarter, you guys did roughly, I think, less than 1% on the volume side and it seems like this needs to pick up, so call it 4%, 4.5% just to get to the low end of the guide. So how \u2013 outside of like what you expect to see as increased penetration on the electronics side, what you do think are the biggest drivers that\u2019s going to get you there and seeing the acceleration in 3Q and 4Q? Dave Petratis : Yes. So let me take it by segments of the market maybe. So on the resi side, it\u2019s really a combination of couple of things, what we talked about previously on the electronics growth and all the activity there relative to the channel, Lennar, new products introduction as well as channel partnership that will help us drive volumes there. Secondly, on the res side, we see a pickup in the builder channel. Collectively that will help us in terms of push-up more volume. On the nonres side, it\u2019s continued strength in the end markets and the healthiness of that and the visibility we have relative to again the order activity specification, backlog, et cetera, I feel fairly positive relative to the volume expectations in the second half. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Okay. Got it. That makes sense. And I guess, maybe my follow-on there is our thinking about like just seasonality. Last year, things were roughly from an earnings standpoint in line 3Q versus 4Q, but seasonally things kind of shift year-to-year. How are you guys thinking about the composition or the cadence for the second half of the year, 3Q versus 4Q? Is there an expectation that one quarter will be much stronger than the other? Patrick Shannon : We don\u2019t normally provide the quarterly guidance, but you should anticipate perhaps maybe a little bit higher Q4 and Q3. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : And the next question comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital. Jeff Kessler : Could you go through some of the new products that you believe are going to \u2013 particularly on the electronics side that you think are going to boost growth in the second half, particularly those that are aimed at the institutional market where you seem to be the most optimistic? Dave Petratis : So Encode on the res side would be what we lead with. Second, maybe not so much in terms of new products, but the partnerships that we\u2019re continuing delivery with Apple and seamless access on college campuses, you\u2019ve seen some of our wins. I think, Mercer college is a clear example. Second, work with Lennar. I think early on, we said that we would be open in our ability to go in and partner is providing wins in the marketplace. We\u2019ve also got our exit devices that are wireless that are driving in the institutional phase. So we think we\u2019re set-up well. I would also go back to some of our earlier generations of products, the ADCO has been out several years, but is positioned to be able to provide that open integration and communication capabilities that customers appreciate. There\u2019s already installed base of that and our ability to be able to leverage that in new electronic applications is why we are winning. Jeff Kessler : Okay. My follow-up question is around Turkey. Could you go a little bit deeper into what are you \u2013 what are your goals in terms of moving production from Turkey to where? And essentially what is \u2013 what are the driving forces that will allow you or makes you think you\u2019re going to become much more efficient in having plants that is not in Turkey? Dave Petratis : So through the acquisition pipeline, we developed a capability out of Poland. In 2017, 2018 we announced a new facility there. We are filling up that facility. Some of that will come with Turkey and it\u2019s really optimizing the supply chain from where we believe is a competitive price market to be able to serve Western Europe. So we think we are nicely positioned. If you look at the history over the last five years of the restructuring that we have driven across Europe, it has significantly improved our profitability, and we think this is the next step in that. Our ultimate goal is to continue to incrementally improve operating income year-over-year and this is another step in that process. Jeff Kessler : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Dave Petratis : All right, Jeff. Operator : And the next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. David Ridley-Lane: This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew. Maybe just following up on that comments on the Turkey operations. Could you quantify sort of a payback period for the \u2013 about $20 million in cash cost relating to that closure? Patrick Shannon : So anytime you close a facility in Europe, it\u2019s going to have an extended payback period, but it\u2019s the right thing to do. It\u2019s more of a, I\u2019d say, a risk mitigation activity than a significant payback on a cash basis. Right thing to do, as Dave mentioned, to serve our customers with expedited supply chain capability. And so there are some benefits throughout the supply chain, not so much from a labor arbitrage, but it\u2019s definitely the right thing to do and we\u2019ll continue to look at opportunities to leverage our footprint going forward. David Ridley-Lane: And then on your comments about optimism for new residential construction. Are those mainly tied to weather? Or are you seeing other reasons why new residential homes in the U.S. would be picking up? Dave Petratis : First, the adoption of electronics, especially Encode 2, we were going through a conversion with Lennar, which will give us top line revenue expansion as we provide them exclusively to their home starts. We continue to have a focused effort on that pro build driven by those electronics. And I think the overall market and it\u2019s no surprise as you look at other companies reporting the new home construction was soft, driven by a variety of factors, we don\u2019t see a big rush to recovery. We think that it runs flat, but we think ourselves will help us both on new construction and retrofit as we move into the second half. David Ridley-Lane: Appreciate the color. Thank you very much. Operator : And the next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Good morning, everyone. One of the things that \u2013 I guess, you\u2019re talking about price productivity versus inflation and price and inflation are always a challenge to forecast. Productivity is presumably is up, and you got a better handle on it. Just help us to better understand what productivity should represent quantitatively if you can quantify for us over the next few quarters? Patrick Shannon : So I would characterize it this way. As you\u2019d expect in any company, it\u2019s all about having a robust pipeline in terms of productivity actions and those would occur either on the sourcing material side and/or at the factory level, labor efficiencies, cost reductions, those types of things. And we got very good visibility in terms of we\u2019ve already executed. That will take place in the back half of the year as well as opportunities for improvement going forward and that\u2019s across all our facilities globally. So feel really good about the healthiness, robustness in terms of our productivity pipeline of both the sourcing material side as well as the throughput in the factory. And then you get the normal leverage of volume overhead leverage equation on the incremental volume that kicks in as well. And as you know, we have very high contribution margins that will contribute to the margin expansion. So it\u2019s a combination of a lot of activities that are going to help us going forward. And on the productivity pipeline visibility, we got very good clarity and expectations on that and good visibility. David MacGregor : Is there any way you can quantify that for us Patrick? Patrick Shannon : I\u2019m sorry, what\u2019s the question? David MacGregor : Is there any way you can quantify that for us? Or at least give us some sense directionally how productivity should compare year-over-year over the next few quarters? Patrick Shannon : Yes. So I\u2019d just say it\u2019s increasing year-over-year, and we\u2019d expect that to continue. The other thing I mentioned here too that we sometimes forget about relative to the productivity, but we are starting to reap benefits from the acquired businesses last year. So the margin profile attached to those will increase, as we get more volume leverage integrating with our sales channel and also integrating some of our enterprise excellence methodology there at those facilities are helping us. And so the acquired businesses is part of the equation and building them in through our company and methodology will help our productivity as well. David MacGregor : Okay. Thanks for that. Second question is, just I guess, on price elasticity and specifically maybe with respect to the non-specified commercial business and maybe mechanical residential as well. But it would seem that with the pricing, you\u2019re seeing a growing gap between opening price point. And I just wonder if you\u2019re seeing people mixing down? Or if that\u2019s creating a little more of a headwind for you from an elasticity standpoint? If you can comment on that? Dave Petratis : I haven\u2019t really seen it in the marketplace. So normally the price movements on the low end and the high end, we look at it by product, but it stays relatively close. So the differential doesn\u2019t move that much between the product categories. And so we\u2019re not seeing a migration at all relative to the low price point. It\u2019s actually, from our perspective, it\u2019s been one of our channel strategies to have a broader breadth of products in that price point that we could sell through the discretionary market. And so that\u2019s been something we continue to drive for the last several years. David MacGregor : Thanks very much. Operator : And the next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Brett Linzey : Hey, good morning guys. It\u2019s Brett, hoping in for Jeff here. Just a question on the Falcon brand. Obviously, we had relatively newer initiative for the company on the value side, but how has the Falcon category grown through the first half of the year relative to some of the traditional mid-to-premium brands? And then as you think about the spec business and some of the bids that are coming in, have you seen a change in the quality preference, specifically for interior doors, but with the Falcon brand where they \u2013 you now might be able to meet some of those requirements? Dave Petratis : So remember, we have positioned with three brands, Dexter, Falcon, and then our premium Schlage, Von Duprin and LCN. We see nice growth in the Falcon brand, maybe a little bit less in Dexter, but what\u2019s happening there when a project gets valued engineered and we need to compete, we\u2019ll pull in those products. You see it a lot in like commercial and you will see Falcon exit devices keyways, Glynn, IVES would be another brand that we would use. I think it depends on where you\u2019re at in the market segmentation. Hospitals, college campuses are going to go for our performance products. And we are going to continue to use our global capability to offer customers choice. Brett Linzey : Okay. Thanks for that. And then just looking at the Americas nonres business up mid-single digits. Is there a way you could separate institutional versus commercial in the quarter, how those performed? And then thinking about the second half, I mean, do you think in commercial can you count some growth or is institutional basically going to carry the day here? Patrick Shannon : I think we will see growth across all verticals. Institutional should be a little bit stronger and again that\u2019s a richer mix product for us holistically. And so \u2013 but strength across all verticals is the way I would be thinking about it. Brett Linzey : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : And as there are no more questions at the present time, I would like to turn the call to Mr. Wagnes for any closing comments. Mike Wagnes : We would like to thank you, everyone, for participating in today\u2019s call. Please contact me for any further questions, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. And I would like to turn the call over to your host today, Mike Wagnes, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Wagnes : Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for Allegion\u2019s third quarter 2019 earnings call. On the call today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we will refer to in today\u2019s call are available on our website at investor.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website. Please go to Slides number 2 and 3. Statements made in today\u2019s call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our most recent SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Today\u2019s presentation and commentary include non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details. Dave and Patrick will now discuss our third quarter 2019 results, which will be followed by Q&A session. For the Q&A, we ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up and then reenter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone, given the time allotted. Please go to Slide #4, and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave. David Petratis : Thanks, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Allegion delivered great results in Q3. I\u2019m extremely pleased with the revenue growth and operational performance, which have positioned us well to deliver on our 2019 commitments. Top-line revenue growth was strong in the third quarter, particularly in the Americas and EMEIA regions. In the Americas, both non-residential and residential businesses saw high-single-digit growth. In EMEIA, we saw solid volume increases across most of the region. The Americas delivered electronics growth of 10% in the quarter, which was a notable performance, considering the challenging comparable from prior year, where we grew nearly 30%. Strong market acceptance of our new highly-rated Schlage Encode residential lock continues to be robust, and help drive the electronics performance in the quarter. We were the first major manufacturer to bring a smart WiFi deadbolt to the market, and it has a lot of momentum in the residential channel. We believe our brands, expanded product portfolio, technical partnerships, breadth of channel relationships and a large installed base provide us with a great opportunity to take advantage of the electronics market, as it continues to evolve and grow. Moving down the slide, Allegion was able to drive price realization and productivity actions, which significantly outpaced inflation. I\u2019m proud of the performance as we saw substantial operating margin expansion, up 220 basis points this quarter. In the third quarter, we delivered robust adjusted EPS growth at nearly 20%, driven primarily by operational performance along with favorable share count and tax rate impact. We are affirming the full-year revenue outlook, in which we continue to project total inorganic revenue growth between 4.5% and 5.5%. I\u2019ll speak to the individual region outlooks later in the presentation. Last, we are tightening the outlook for our reported EPS going from a range of $4.50 to $4.65 per share to a revised outlook of $4.55 to $4.65 per share. The adjusted EPS outlook is also been tightened by rising the low-end of the range and going from $4.80 to $4.90 per share, to a revised outlook of $4.85 to $4.90 per share. Please go to Slide 5. Revenue for the third quarter was $748.3 million, an increase of 5.2%, inclusive of 6.4% organic growth. Currency headwinds offset some of the organic growth. The Americas and EMEIA region were responsible for the organic growth results. Patrick will share more detail on this. Adjusted operating margin increased by 220 basis points, aided by substantial contribution from price and productivity outpacing inflation. Solid leverage on incremental volume also provided benefit to the margin expansion. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.47 increased by nearly 20% versus the prior year. As mentioned, the increase was driven primarily by operational performance, along with favorable share count and a lower tax rate. Year-to-date available cash flow is up slightly. With the increased earnings, we have experienced this year, being mostly offset by increased capital expenditures. Please go to Slide 6. In March, we shared our refreshed corporate strategy with you, which centers on our vision of seamless access. Since that time, momentum and market acceptance continues to build. For instance, smartphones and the connectivity are the norm. This translates to pressure from our customers to meet end-users\u2019 demand for a mobile connected life, while ensuring security. Allegion is well positioned to meet this demand. We see strong uptake with our seamless ID solutions for universities and edge devices, and adoption of Schlage Encode, and in emerging technologies and venturing opportunities. We\u2019re confident in the long-term electronic opportunity and see that seamless access and safety lay a solid foundation for our future. As a reminder, our five strategic pillars that guide Allegion are : Expand in Core Markets, we continue to broaden the core business through existing and new channel relationships, digital demand creation and leading products; Be the Partner of Choice, delivering seamless access means we\u2019re intent on leveraging partners and ecosystems to drive growth, which includes using open platforms that integrate well with others; Deliver New Value in Access, our innovation will focus on the user experience for access, as well as working with partners to create unique solutions that increase safety and speed up productivity, we are also intent on bringing new products to market faster; Capital Allocation, Allegion will continue to take a disciplined and flexible approach to capital deployment, one that spans organic investments, acquisitions and shareholder distributions to optimize shareholder returns; last, Enterprise Excellence, Allegion is committed to creating value through productivity, through excellent customer experience and through a culture of safety, health and employee engagement. Access has been a part of the company\u2019s heritage for 100 years and seamless access will define our company going forward. Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I\u2019ll be back to discuss the 2019 outlook. Patrick Shannon : Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call today. If you would, please go to Slide #7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the third quarter. I\u2019ll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 6.4% organic growth in Q3. We saw strong volumes and solid price realization drive the organic increase this quarter, led by both the Americas and EMEIA regions. Volumes recovered nicely from Q2 levels, as market demand was strong. Also during the third quarter, currency in EMEIA and Asia Pacific continue to be a headwind on total revenue growth. Please go to Slide #8. Reported net revenues for the third quarter were $748.3 million, as stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 5.2% versus the prior year, up 6.4% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $173 million increased more than 16% over the same timeframe last year. Adjusted operating margin of 23.1% increased 220 basis points. It represents our highest quarterly adjusted operating margin since spin. Leverage on incremental volumes, price realization and substantial productivity drove the operating income increased in margin expansion. During the quarter, all regions contributed sizeable margin improvements. Headwinds to margin performance included incremental investments, which had a 30 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins. Please go to Slide #9. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2018, reported earnings per share was a $1.21. Adjusting $0.02 for the prior year restructuring and acquisition charges as well as adjustments to provisions related to the enactment of tax reform. The Q3 2018 adjusted earnings per share was a $1.23. Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.24 as favorable price, productivity and operating leverage on incremental volume more than offset inflationary impacts and unfavorable currency. Favorable year-over-year share count drove another $0.03 increase as we have executed nearly $180 million in share buyback so far this year. A decrease in the year-over-year tax rate improved earnings per share by $0.02. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.02 reduction. The combination of interest expense, other expense and noncontrolling interest had a negative $0.03 impact, which was driven mostly by favorable other income in 2018. This results in adjusted third quarter 2019 earnings per share of $1.47, an increase of $0.24 or nearly 20% compared to the prior year period. Lastly, we had a $0.07 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring, acquisitions and debt refinancing. After giving effect to these onetime items, you arrive at the third quarter 2019 reported earnings per share of $1.40. Please go to Slide #10. This quarter revenues for the Americas region were $567.8 million, up 7.1% on a reported basis and 7.2% organically. Organic growth was driven by strong volume along with continued price realization. When compared to Q3 of last year, we experienced high-single-digit growth in both nonresidential and residential, as nonresidential market demand remain strong and residential rebounded nicely from a sluggishness, we experienced in the first half of the year. Electronics growth for the quarter came in at 10%. As Dave mentioned earlier, we are pleased with this electronics performance given that the quarter was going up against a nearly 30% growth rate compared to last year. Americas adjusted operating income of $175.6 million increased 13.8% versus the prior year period, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 180 basis points. The increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by leverage on incremental volume along with price and productivity significantly exceeding inflation. Incremental investments were a 50 basis point decrease on operating margins. Please go to Slide #11. Third quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $137.8 million, up 2.5% and up 6.9% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by increased volume across most products along with solid price realization. Total revenue growth continues to be reduced by significant currency headwinds. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $12 million increased 17.6% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 110 basis points with price and leverage on incremental volume contributing to the increase. Timing of year-over-year investments benefitted operating margins by 80 basis points, as start-up costs incurred in 2018 related to our new Poland facility did not repeat this year. Please go to Slide #12. Third quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $42.7 million, down 9.1% versus the prior year. Organic revenue decreased 4.8%. The organic revenue decline was driven by softer residential markets in Australia along with internal revenue transfer of $1.5 million to the other regions. Foreign currency was again a significant headwind for the quarter reducing revenue by more than 4%. Asia-Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $4.4 million, an increase of 37.5% with adjusted operating margins improving 350 basis points versus the prior year period. The regions saw strong productivity, the results of restructuring actions taken last year and acquisition integration, which offset the 70 basis point headwind from incremental investments. Of note, 2019 Q3 operating income includes a $1.1 million favorable recovery of previously remitted non-income tax, which had a 260 basis point favorable impact on Asia-Pacific margins in the quarter. Please go to Slide #13. Year-to-date available cash flow for the third quarter 2019 was $230 million, which is an increase of $1.4 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by increased net earnings mostly offset by increased capital spending. Working capital as a percent of revenues increased in the third quarter and the cash conversion cycle was also slightly higher. We continue to remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to both minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow. Lastly, we are affirming our full year available cash flow outlook range of $410 million to $430 million. I\u2019ll now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2019 outlook. David Petratis : Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide #14. As you can see on the slide, and was mentioned earlier we are affirming our revenue outlook for the total company. The consolidated outlook for total and organic revenue remains at a range of 4.5% to 5.5%, although we\u2019re adjusting within the regions. In the Americas, we continue to see positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals led by institutional markets, which we believe, will continue to remain solid for the near-term future. In residential, we saw Q3 rebound from the sluggishness we experienced during the first half of the year. In addition, we expect the general positive trend for electronic products to continue for the foreseeable future, and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this long-term trend. Therefore, we are slightly increasing the revenue outlook for Americas. For the EMEIA region, we expect continued currency pressures for the remainder of the year and have taken down our outlook for total revenue. However, organic revenue remains unchanged. In Asia-Pacific, we expect the softness in the Australian markets to continue, particularly around residential end markets. We also expect unfavorable currency impacts to continue. As such, we are lowering the outlook for both reported and organic growth in the region. We are also updating the earnings per share outlook, raising the low-end of both our reported and adjusted EPS ranges. Our reported EPS outlook is now at a range of $4.55 to $4.65 per share, with adjusted EPS at a range of $4.85 to $4.90. This represents adjusted EPS growth of approximately 8% to 9%. As Patrick stated, we are affirming our cash flow outlook range of $410 million to $430 million. The outlook updates the expected investment spend to a range of $0.11 to $0.13 per share. The full year adjusted effective tax rate is being updated to approximately 15.5% with a favorability experienced in Q3 mostly offset in Q4. We are updating our outlook for outstanding diluted shares for the full year to approximately $94.3 million, reflecting the buyback activity completed so far this year, and including expected share repurchases for Q4. Please go to Slide 15. As a brief summary of Allegion\u2019s Q3 performance total revenue grew 5.2%, organic revenue grew 6.4%, adjusted operating margins were up 220 basis points, adjusted EPS was up nearly 20%. In Q3, we delivered our highest quarterly revenue, operating margins and earnings per share. Allegion has an operating system of operations that continue to strengthen the foundational elements of both safety and innovation. The system combined with strong brands and channel relationships has been a hallmark of our performance since spin and certainly helped us deliver the third quarter results. Thank you to every member of the Allegion team. Your commitment to excellence strengthens our future. Now, Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Yes, thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] And the first question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : Yes. Good morning. David Petratis : Good morning, Andrew. Patrick Shannon : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a question, we got a lot of questions I think regarding the fourth quarter guide and given the organic performance in the quarter. Was there any pull-forward of revenue from fourth quarter into third quarter? And I apologize. I joined a little bit late. But just conservatism about organic growth, specifically in Americas in Q4, given the performance in the third quarter? David Petratis : So, I would characterize Q3 extremely strong growth, as indicated 7% organic growth. Really good performance, both in the non-res and residential segments. No real pull-forward of activity. I would say, business improved a little bit kind of as we progressed throughout the quarter, which was good to see. But just as a reminder, we did increase our full-year guide on organic revenue growth, given the Q3 performance. And so, that\u2019s baked in there. Our year-to-date organic growth, Americas is at 6%, and our full-year guidance is kind of within that range. And so, still expect a good Q4 going forward and we\u2019ll finish the year strong relative to top-line performance. Andrew Obin : And then, just a follow-up question. One of your competitors highlighted on their conference calls that they are starting to see sort of signs of markets slowing. I wonder if they were referring to your census data. But you guys are \u2013 I think are quite a bit more upbeat. What kind of visibility do you have over the next 12 to 18 months? Thank you. David Petratis : So we are solid, positive, upbeat on the economy. As I look at the positive factors, consumer confidence, low unemployment, state and local tax revenues which are a key for our business, low interest rates and tightness in the housing market. I don\u2019t know why you could not be positive about the view going forward. I was looking at future activity for bond issues. In the State of Texas there is 84 bond issues on the ballot. I just see a trend and need in the economy for investments on both residential and non-residential and feel positive about the outlook. Andrew Obin : Got you. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Just wanted to ask about the residential business, you did have a good acceleration there in the third quarter. Whether you see that growth rate as sort of a blip, because you were starting a bunch of initiatives or whether you think that because of all your sort of self-help measures in resi, you can drive a good mid-single-digit-plus growth rate in the quarters and years ahead? David Petratis : I think if you compare our first-half residential performance, which I believe was plus 4, was respectable in a soft patch in the market. We also had some self-help there or correction that we were doing in the channel. The market improved in Q3, that\u2019s reflective. I think the best opportunities going forward in res will be multifamily, that continues strong. I think single family, which is important to us is going to continue to plot along. It\u2019s not getting significantly better. You add electronics on top of that with some of our leading products, our high star ratings, our connectivity and the first WiFi embedded lock. I think it sets us up for continued solid performance in that segment. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And then, just my second quick one would be around the implied sort of operating margins in Q4. We\u2019ve had some questions this morning around, it looks as if that implies a softer margin performance than what you saw in the third quarter, just based on the full-year guide. Just maybe any comments you could provide on that fourth quarter margin trend year-on-year, any big headwinds or tailwinds you\u2019d call out? David Petratis : Yeah. Well, let me first maybe comment on a little bit more specifics on Q3 operating margin performance. So as indicated, really strong across the board. All regions showing fairly significant margin improvement. We did benefit, if you kind of look at the price, productivity, inflation dynamic, extremely favorable. Inflation, you may recall last year was at a peak in Q3. And so, the comparisons were easier, if you will, and that gap was extremely favorable in the reported results in Q3 this year. We won\u2019t see that favorability as much reflected in Q4. And therefore, the margin profile expansion won\u2019t be as strong in Q3. However, I would say, just given the anticipated continued strength in the overall markets, revenue growth, et cetera, we will have good operating margin improvement year-over-year with margins continuing to expand. And our full-year expectation, again, is like an 80 to 100 basis point margin improvement full year. So still anticipate strong operational performance in Q4 to finish out the year. Patrick Shannon : Hey, just one point of clarification. Julian. The number Dave quoted for residential, that was year-to-date for the resi growth. Julian Mitchell : Understood. Thanks very much for the help. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead, Deepa. Your line is open. Is your phone on mute perhaps? Very well, we\u2019ll move on. The next question is from Josh Chan with Baird. Josh Chan : Hi, good morning, and congrats on a strong quarter. David Petratis : Thank you. Josh Chan : I wanted to ask about sort of the \u2013 your confidence in terms of the Americas outlook. I wonder if you have kind of internally tried to reconcile some of the softer kind of data points versus what you are kind of seeing in your business in terms of non-res overall growth. And just kind of curious, what kind of conclusion you might have come across? And then also, what kind of verticals, in particular, are you seeing that strength into the rest of the year and 2020, I guess? David Petratis : So a lot packed into that. I think you\u2019ve got to look at the macro noise and take heed of that. Again as I look at the macro, I see a lot of positive out there, including, again I\u2019ll emphasize state and local tax revenues. Then you\u2019ve got to square that with what\u2019s the level of our backlog, code activities. I\u2019d remind you, Josh, that construction backlogs still remain at over 8 months, that\u2019s healthy. Residential inventories, historic low from my perspective at 4 months. And then, look at our activities for quotes, we like what we see going forward, that continued solid progression of the business. You have to temper that with electronics, which we think positively influences. So we\u2019re confident in what we see over the next 9 to 12 months. Josh Chan : All right. That\u2019s good to hear. And my follow-up is on the investment spending. I noticed that you kind of took the investment spend down a little bit for the year. I wonder, if that\u2019s a little bit of a shift in terms of thinking? Or just \u2013 is that more timing or anything to read into there? David Petratis : Nothing really to read into that, more of a timing item. When we look at the end markets, there are still many opportunities to continue to invest in our business, particularly around channels, demand creation, new product development, this Internet of Things platform connectivity seamless access, there is a host of activities that we can continue to invest and that we believe will continue to accelerate our top-line performance. And so we\u2019ll continue to look at those opportunities and give you more kind of specifics relative to 2020 going forward. But there is a lot of activity and things we can continue to invest and continue to drive our business forward. Josh Chan : Okay, great. Thank you for your time. David Petratis : Thanks, Josh. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. John Walsh : Hi, good morning. David Petratis : Good morning, John. John Walsh : Hey, congrats on a strong operational quarter as well. I guess, two questions. One, thinking about pricing, obviously, we knew it was going to step down given the comparison of what we saw in the first half of this year, but it was better than I thought. So one, I was curious if that\u2019s kind of mix related or if you\u2019re actually realizing better capture on price than maybe you would have anticipated? David Petratis : Nothing out of the ordinary, I mean, you hit it right in terms of \u2013 sequentially, the pricing was down, but pretty much in line with our expectations. The teams across the board, I would say, particularly in Americas and Europe continue to execute extremely well on price realization and capturing what they can. Particularly in the nonresidential segment, as you know, resi a little bit harder to get price, particularly in the big box arena, but performance has been good and we\u2019ll continue to drive it going forward and capture what we can given the strong markets. John Walsh : Got you. And then, obviously, good cash performance, cash built quarter-over-quarter kind of what are your expectations or visibility into capital allocation decisions, whether it be M&A or share repurchase or others? David Petratis : I would say, we continue with our strategy. We think, there is opportunities are to wring some cash out on inventories. We invested in 2019 with some of the moves that we made globally. And I\u2019m extremely pleased on how we executed on that moves. Our move from Turkey to Poland that some ERP consolidations that never hit the press that we\u2019re executing in a high level, we put some additional inventory in place that will wring out of the system. As we think about capital deployment, the M&A pipeline continues to be robust, prices are high. We remain disciplined and we continue to be active in terms of some stock repurchases. John Walsh : Thank you. And If I can just sneak one more in here if you don\u2019t mind. Just thinking about the electronics growth rate, I mean, you have \u2013 you did have a very difficult compare, you have an easier compare in Q4. You had been doing 20% to 30% growth-on-growth and it really ticked up this quarter. Anything to call out there? Or how we should think about that growth rate going forward, just given the very strong growth-on-growth? David Petratis : Our growth in electronics has been robust over the last several years. It\u2019s hard to put up 30% growth a year-ago and top that, so the numbers are getting bigger. The opportunities are also remaining, I think, compelling. If you remember at Investor Day, 40 billion openings in the world, connected devices, technologies, our approach to open protocols with connected capabilities continues to open up opportunities. We think, we understand the growth of these markets on a global basis and it will continue to be a positive driver for Allegion. Patrick Shannon : Yeah. But you characterized it right. If I can add that the comparisons get a little bit easier, particularly in Q4, but kind of low-double-digit is kind of how you should think about it going forward. John Walsh : Great. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeff Kessler from Imperial Capital. Jeffrey Kessler : Thank you. At the recent GSX conference. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time with Brad, going through the way the company has \u2013 is essentially changing its sale, it\u2019s go-to-market with customers, trying to get a more holistic [Technical Difficulty] selling product by product. If you could \u2013 I\u2019m wondering, if that has played into the efficiency and the margin improvement that you\u2019ve seen in the last couple of quarters? David Petratis : So you\u2019re breaking up a little bit there, but I\u2019ll try and hit that. The conversations you had with Brad. I think, number one, partnerships is one of our strategic objectives here. Working with people, the big integrators whether it\u2019s CBORD, whether it\u2019s Bosch, Siemens, we think we bring a unique approach to that. I think, second is a heavy focus on customer satisfaction and quality through the value stream. I\u2019d like to think that from when we first work with an architect to when we install, we can be the best provider through that stream. And it\u2019s \u2013 any time you\u2019ve got an industry like ours that\u2019s got a mechanical heritage and we\u2019re introducing electronics and connectivity the high role. There is opportunity to differentiate ourselves. And I\u2019m confident Brad talked about this, but it\u2019s really around customer satisfaction and partnering with tools like Overtur, making sure our connected devices install seamlessly on the customer campus or activity with the best products. This is our strategy. Jeffrey Kessler : Okay. And as far \u2013 I know, I\u2019m breaking up a little bit, because I have problems with this phone. I apologize for that. And just as a follow \u2013 a specific follow-up to that. In going to market, how have you been able to use your open market stance compared to \u2013 eventually compared to your major competitor and being able to develop the partnerships you were talking about? And indeed, being able to convince people, more and more people to use Overtur, because you do have an open system. Are you finding that there is any resistance to that? Or is that open system \u2013 does that open system allow you to be able to talk to the \u2013 your channel a little bit easier? David Petratis : I believe with our position and strategy to be open gives us an advantage. It\u2019s also a key that we\u2019re flexible there. We\u2019ll have customers that want control, they want closed systems. And it\u2019s really having that flexibility with our customers that were not going drive one connected strategy that we leave that to the customer and we adapt to that. I think this is important around things like identity and we\u2019re intentional in creating differentiation there. Jeffrey Kessler : Okay. Thank you for that. Identity, I think, is probably going to be a step, one of your next steps going forward down the line. I mean, it would be just a natural evolution for you. David Petratis : [indiscernible]. Jeffrey Kessler : Just a comment on my part. Okay. Thank you very much and congrats on the quarter. David Petratis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Robert Aurand : Hi. Rob Aurand on for David this morning. Last quarter, you had discussed taking actions to remove bad actors in the e-commerce channel. You\u2019re protecting pricing for residential locks. I guess can you talk about the success of that? Is that channel cleaned up now? Is there more actions to take? Or did your more bad actors just take the place of who you cleaned up last quarter? How is that playing out? David Petratis : I\u2019d say our work in terms of just some good maintenance in the channel is behind us. The introduction of e-commerce over the last few years creates a little bit of a situation like the Wild West. You can have things appear on eBay or storefronts can pop up. It\u2019s part of the natural evolution. But, yes, we think that\u2019s behind us. And I think reflective of some of the growth we saw in the quarter. Robert Aurand : Perfect. And then just on pricing, I mean, you\u2019re still saying strong price realization in the third quarter. I guess with raw material prices coming down, how do you see that playing out going forward? David Petratis : I would say, and you know this relative to our industry, we\u2019ll continue to push price. Even a couple of years ago in a deflationary environment, which were, in that today to the extent of input cost being a little bit lower year-over-year, we can still probably push price a little bit, given the strong market demand. And we will do that and remain competitive. And so, you wouldn\u2019t see necessarily the full year-over-year price increase that you will see for the full year 2019 going forward. But nonetheless, you should expect continued price realization in the broader market. Robert Aurand : All right. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. And next we have another question from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities. Deepa Raghavan : Hey, good morning. I apologize if this question was asked already. But, so can you talk about the progression of the quarter by months? If you can talk if it was progressively better, worse, or you think it was as expected? That\u2019s my first question. David Petratis : I think a normal third quarter, we\u2019ve got operating systems here that we try and track how we move through it. It\u2019s the peak of the summer construction season. And I think things behave normally. Deepa Raghavan : Okay. Was there any pull-forward of demand in Q3 from Q4? I mean, you\u2019ve kept your guide basically, even though Q3 kind of outperformed. So just curious, what are some of the puts and takes we should be thinking about as we think through Q4? Or is there \u2013 you just want to bake-in some conservatism, because there\u2019s still a lot out there in macros that you probably can\u2019t forecast precisely. David Petratis : I would characterize it as not any specific pull-forward of activity, i.e., specific actions. I would say Q3 came in better than originally anticipated when we were together 90 days ago, but again, still anticipating a relatively strong performance in Q4 going forward. Deepa Raghavan : Got it. Okay. So just, is there a tax give back in Q4? Sorry, that\u2019s... Patrick Shannon : Yeah. So that\u2019s a good point. And Dave mentioned it a little bit relative to the full-year guide. So as indicated, our effective tax rate for Q3 came in better than anticipated. That turns negative on us in Q4, so that you have a much higher tax rate in Q4 relative to the year-to-date tax rate, which today stands a little bit south of 15%. So with the full year of 15.5% you can kind of work the math. And so that\u2019s going to be a pretty big headwind for year-over-year comparability in Q4. Deepa Raghavan : Got it. My final one, sorry. So what is the normalized price\u2026 Mike Wagnes : And, Deepa\u2026 Deepa Raghavan : Yes. Mike Wagnes : Deepa, we\u2019re going to ask you to get back in queue. We have to get to other callers. Deepa Raghavan : No worries. Thank you. Yeah, thanks so much. Yeah. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, I would like to return the floor to Mike Wagnes for any closing comments. Mike Wagnes : Sorry. Why don\u2019t we let Deepa, since she is the last question? Launch it far away, Deepa. Operator : Okay. Just one moment, let me reactivate her line. One minute, please. Deepa Raghavan : Hi. Can you hear me? Hey, hi, can you hear me now? Mike Wagnes : Sorry about that. Deepa Raghavan : Yeah. No, no, no worries. Just one on pricing here, I mean, pretty strong pricing trends. I think this got asked a couple of different ways already. But what\u2019s the normalized price range? Do I start \u2013 do we start to bake in like more 1% to 2% price range going forward? Or \u2013 it just seems like pricing is at this point in time a little peakish. You may have the commodity tailwinds and everything. But just given, how do we think about it in a normalized range? And that\u2019s my final question. Thank you so much. Patrick Shannon : Yeah. I think about around 1%, maybe a little bit north of that. But that would be kind of a normalized type of level. David Petratis : I would also say, we\u2019ll continue to push Allegion to be disciplined in pricing. We\u2019re seeing wage inflation. I think it\u2019s important that our team think about those pressures and make sure that we\u2019re responsible in going out there and winning our business, driving strong productivity equations and continuing to make sure that we\u2019re compensated for the value that we create I think with our customer relationships. Deepa Raghavan : Got it. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, I would like to return the floor to Mike Wagnes for any closing comments, please. Mike Wagnes : We want to thank everyone for participating in today\u2019s call. Please contact me for any further questions and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Please go to slide number 4, and I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave Petratis : Thanks Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Allegion experienced modest top line revenue growth in the fourth quarter with strength in the Americas offset by weakness in Europe and Asia Pacific. The Americas region had reported an organic growth of 6.8% in the quarter driven by both the non-residential and residential businesses. The EMEIA region saw market soften and the complexity of moving our operations from Turkey to Poland negatively impacted the top line as well as operating income. The level of effort in executing a move like this cannot be underestimated. While we did experience some impact from the transition, we are better positioned after leaving Turkey. Asia Pacific continued to experience weak markets in Australia and saw deteriorating markets in China. Electronics growth in the Americas came in just over 12% in the quarter and increased over 10% for the full year. We continue to see electronics as a long-term positive trend, as more and more products become connected for ease of access As I look to our end markets, U.S. nonresidential remains healthy and U.S. residential has improved. As I mentioned EMEIA and Asia Pacific are experiencing weaknesses in the markets they serve and we see that continuing in the near-term. Adjusted operating margins were up 30 basis points in the quarter and 70 basis points for the full year. Margin expansion was led by the Americas region, which saw a full year adjusted margins, up 120 basis points. Volume leverage was good during the year, and the price productivity inflation dynamic was positive. In the fourth quarter, adjusted EPS growth came in at nearly 5%, bringing the full year increase to approximately 9%. Available cash flow was up nearly $14 million to $422.6 million for the year. Overall, I'm pleased with our full year 2019 results. We saw good revenue performance, expanded adjusted operating margins, delivered solid adjusted EPS growth and generated substantial available cash flow. Please go to slide 5, and I'll walk you through the fourth quarter financial summary. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $719.5 million, an increase of 2.4%, inclusive of 3.5% organic growth. Currency headwinds and the impact of the divestiture of our business in Turkey offset some of the organic growth. Americas led the way on revenue growth, offsetting the weakness we experienced in EMEIA and Asia Pacific. Patrick will share more detail on the regions in a moment. Adjusted operating margin increased by 30 basis points in the fourth quarter as we saw significant margin expansion in the Americas with declines in Europe and Asia. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.28 increased $0.06 or nearly 5% versus the prior year. The increase was driven primarily by higher operating income. Favorable share count and interest expense offset the unfavorable year-over-year tax rate increase. Available cash flow for the year came at $422.6 million, an increase of nearly $14 million versus prior year. Increased adjusted earnings and improvement in net working capital were the driving factors for the increase. Please go to slide 6. This year, we're recognizing Schlage for its past, present and future innovation. 2020 marks the 100th anniversary of the brand, and we're proud to celebrate this milestone in various ways that support the business and engage the customer, non-residential and residential audiences. As a legacy brand with a rich history there is no doubt that Schlage is an important part of the Allegion story. Schlage has been providing security, style and peace of mind for the last 100 years. From the first push-button lock pioneered by Walter Schlage in 1920 to the high-tech mobile solutions of today, our trusted brand's passion for door hardware is rooted in security and steeped in innovation. As you may recall, we saw a strong market acceptance of the Schlage Encode residential lock after it was introduced in 2019, especially because we were the first major manufacturer to bring a smart WiFi deadbolt to the market. By year's end, the Schlage Encode was recognized as the best-in-class product by consumer tech influencers at CNET, Digital Trends and Consumer Reports among others. Just last month, it was named the best smart door lock to keep intruders out, highlighting the peace of mind Schlage is known to bring to homeowners across the globe. And it's not only -- and it's not the only one driving recognition of the Schlage suite of products, our Schlage Sense and Schlage Connect also continue to receive accolades in the smart home market as the best smart locks you can buy and the best tech gifts. Collectively, these smart locks along with Schlage Encode, has been recognized by tech experts as the best to work with Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit and Google Home. As a powerful brand, we expect Schlage will continue to set the bar for customer experience in our industry and redefine what's possible with security solutions for seamless access. Please go to slide 7. Last March, we announced our business strategy, centered on seamless access and a safer world. Allegion has a strong internal innovation engines, creating award-winning products like the one you just saw as well as overture for specification work flow and next-generation products like the SimonsVoss, SmartHandle AX. As we looked at the future, we see the opportunity for technology to drive progress in seamless access. What I'd like to highlight today is edge computing. We made a leap forward in edge devices with the acquisition of ISONAS. It was a good technology move. And through Allegion Ventures, we're investing in companies that approach authentication and people flow in new ways companies like Pindrop, Robin and Openpath. I'm excited to see the ways we can create new value and access by current Schlage products and the data and analytical capabilities of a company like Openpath. You'll see us continue to look for opportunities to invest, partner and drive progress through internal and external innovation that aligns with our strategic pillars : Be the partner of choice, deliver new value and access, smart capital allocation, expanding our core markets and focus on enterprise excellence. Access has been a part of the company heritage for more than 100 years and seamless access will define our company going forward. Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2020 outlook. Patrick Shannon : Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to Slide number 8. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the fourth quarter as well as the full year of 2019. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 3.5% organic growth in the fourth quarter. Overall, we saw solid volume and price realization led by the Americas region. Price continued to remain strong, particularly in the Americas nonresidential business. The impact of the divestiture of our business in Turkey, along with continued currency pressure in EMEIA and Asia Pacific were a headwind to total growth. With the fourth quarter performance, you can see where we ended up for the full year on revenue growth. Total top line revenue saw an increase of 4.5% for the year and organic growth came in at 4.6% led by Americas at more than 6%. As indicated, Americas organic growth in the fourth quarter was higher than the full year results, while EMEIA and Asia Pacific were weaker. Please go to Slide number 9. Reported net revenues for the fourth quarter were $719.5 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 2.4% versus the prior year, up 3.5% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $151 million increased 4% over the same time frame from last year. Adjusted operating margin of 21% increased 30 basis points. The margin expansion was primarily driven by solid operating leverage on incremental volumes in the Americas along with pricing and productivity outpacing inflation. Headwinds to margin performance include incremental investments which had a 30 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins. For the full year, the company experienced adjusted operating margin expansion of 70 basis points. Please go to Slide number 10. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2018, reported earnings per share was $1.39. Adjusting $0.17 for the prior year restructuring expenses, integration cost related to acquisitions and benefits related to U.S. tax reform, the 2018 adjusted earnings per share was $1.22. Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.08 as favorable price. Operating leverage on incremental volume and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts and unfavorable currency. Favorable year-over-year share count drove another $0.03 increase, reflective of the $226 million of share buyback that occurred during 2019. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.02 reduction and unfavorable year-over-year tax rate drove another negative $0.03 per share impact. This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2019 earnings per share of $1.28, an increase of $0.06 or nearly 5% compared to the prior year. Lastly, we have a $0.42 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring, trade name impairments, as well as loss on divestitures in Turkey and Colombia. The loss on divestitures was predominantly associated with non-cash currency translation adjustments, previously deferred in equity and reclassified into earnings upon the sale of the divested businesses. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at fourth quarter 2019 reported earnings per share of $0.86. Please go to Slide number 11. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $526.3 million, up 6.8% on both a reported and organic basis. The growth was driven by strong price realization and volume. Both the nonresidential and residential businesses grew nicely and at similar levels to each other. The residential business had strong growth in the quarter attributed to new products and increased sales in the builder channel. Electronics growth for the quarter was just over 12% and was sequentially higher than the prior quarter. As Dave mentioned earlier, the full year electronics growth in the Americas was solid at just over 10%. Electronics products continue to be a long-term growth driver as consumers and end users migrate to electronics from solely mechanical products as a value connectivity and convenience. Americas adjusted operating income of $153.9 million increased 16.8% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 240 basis points. Strong volume leverage, along with price and productivity significantly exceeding inflation, drove substantial margin expansion. Incremental investments were a 40 basis point decrease to margins. With the outstanding Q4 performance, full year adjusted operating margins in Americas were up 120 basis points. Please go to slide number 12. Fourth quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $149.6 million, down 5% and down 1.5% on an organic basis. The lower volume was driven by weakening end markets across the region. The impact of the divestiture of the business in Turkey and currency headwinds also contributed to the revenue decline. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $16.7 million, decreased 25.8% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter, decreased by a disappointing 310 basis points. During the quarter, inflation exceeded price, plus productivity and currency headwinds continued to be a drag on margins. In addition, revenue declines also had a negative impact on operating margins. The plant relocation from Turkey related to the divestiture of that business, drove additional costs in the quarter. The magnitude of the move while anticipated resulted in some operational inefficiencies that are likely to continue in the near-term future but are also expected to be resolved as we progress in 2020. These types of moves are extremely complex. And though we did experience increased costs, we are better positioned being out of Turkey in the long run. With the drag of the Q4 performance, full year adjusted operating margins were down 10 basis points in the region. Please go to slide number 13. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $43.6 million, down 16.6% versus the prior year. Organic revenue was down 13.4%. The decline was driven by continued weakness in Australian end markets, particularly on the residential side, as well as declines experienced in China, attributable to weaker end markets. Total revenue continued to be affected by currency headwinds. Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $1.9 million, a decrease of $4.6 million with adjusted operating margins down 800 basis points versus the prior year period. Approximately $1 million of the income decline was attributable to inflation exceeding price plus productivity. Significant volume declines and unfavorable mix had a large impact on the reduced income and margin. We have initiated restructuring actions to lower the cost base and accelerate integration of the GWA business. These actions will better position us to address the market challenges in the region. Full year adjusted operating margins for Asia Pacific were down 180 basis points in 2019. Please go to slide number 14. Available cash flow for 2019 came in at $422.6 million, which is an increase of $13.9 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by higher adjusted net earnings and improvements in net working capital, partially offset by increases in restructuring spend and capital expenditures. Looking at the chart at the bottom of the slide, it shows working capital as a percent of revenues increased based on a four-point quarter average. However, the year-end working capital as a percent of revenue was lower at the end of 2019, compared to the same point in time last year. As always, we remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to increase available cash flow and minimize investments in working capital, increasing the velocity of asset turnover. I will now hand it back over to Dave for a view on our full year 2020 outlook. Dave Petratis : Thank you, Patrick. Please go to slide 15. We continue to see favorable trends in our primary end markets in 2020. We also believe growth in the electronics portfolio will continue to outpace mechanical in all regions and we are well positioned to continue to take advantage of this industry trend. In the Americas, we see continued positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals. The residential end markets have rebounded and improved. We expect the general trend towards electronic products in both residential and nonresidential businesses to continue. With these expectations, we project organic revenue growth in the Americas of 4.5% to 5.5%. We are projecting Americas total revenue expansion to be 4% to 5% with a slight impact from divesting our business in Colombia. In Europe, markets have softened in Germany and Southern Europe and remained weak in the U.K. For the region, we project total and organic growth to be 1.5% to 2.5% led by our SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses. In Asia Pacific, we expect weakness in the Australian markets to continue particularly in residential. The market in China has also softened. With that backdrop, we expect growth in the region to be flat both on a reported and organic basis with declines expected in the first half of the year and modest recovery in the second half on easier comparisons. All-in, we are projecting total revenue growth for the company at a range of 3% to 4% with organic growth between 3.5% and 4.5%. Please go to slide 16. Our 2020 outlook for adjusted earnings per share is $5.10 to $5.20, an increase of approximately 4% to 6%. As indicated the earnings increase is driven by revenue growth and operational improvements as adjusted operating earnings are expected to increase 6% to 8%. Our outlook anticipated -- anticipates continued volume leverage and a positive equation for price, productivity and inflation. We also expect margin accretion in all regions for the full year, but continued pressure in the first half for EMEIA and Asia Pacific. Incremental investments continue to be a headwind as we remain focused on accelerating new product development and channel initiatives, which we believe enable us to keep delivering above-market growth and allows us to take advantage of the shifting customer preferences for electronic products. The combination of interest and other expense is expected to be a slight positive to earnings per share. Our outlook assumes a full year adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 16.5% to 17%, an increase from 14.3% in 2019. It also assumes outstanding weighted average diluted shares of approximately 93 million. The outlook additionally includes a $0.10 per share impact from restructuring charges during the year. As a result, reported EPS is estimated at $5 to $5.10. We are projecting our available cash flow for 2020 to be in the $450 million to $470 million range. Please go to slide 17. We are pleased with our 2019 performance, which saw top line growth that delivered organic revenue expansion of 4.6%, adjusted operating margins up 70 basis points, adjusted EPS growth of nearly 9% and strong available cash flow. And while it's not highlighted on this slide, we strengthened the foundational elements of Allegion's culture that will help drive our success as a company into this new decade. Safety and sustainability and engagement, in 2019 we were safer reducing workplace accidents and their cost, which were already below the industry average. We were cleaner, reducing energy inputs and waste outputs and we were significantly more engaged, meaning our global employees are more committed to our vision and our work than ever before. As we look to 2020 and renew our commitment to safety, sustainability and engagement we are well-positioned to drive continued growth in revenue and earnings. We also expect to deliver solid growth in adjusted earnings per share and generate substantial available cash flow. Before we take questions, I'd like to take a moment to share some news with regard to the organization changes here at Allegion. Mike Wagnes, will be assuming a general management role, within the Americas business. Mike has been Treasurer. And Head of Investor Relations since the summer of 2016. Since that time, Mike has served as a valuable voice for the shareholder community, among the leadership team. As we move forward, Tom Martineau, Vice President Finance, for the EMEIA region will assume the Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations role. Many of you are familiar with Tom. And know that he brings a wealth of financial experience and knowledge that will position him well as Allegion's primary representative, to the investment community. I'd like to congratulate both Mike and Tom, on their new opportunities. This transition has been completed. And you can begin contacting Tom, for any investor-related questions, on a go-forward basis. Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions. Question-and: Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today will come from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. And thanks, Mike for all the help, in the last few years. Just wanted to follow-up on the comments around the first half softness, particularly in the international regions, just wondered, if you could put a finer point on what that means for the earnings cadence through the year. Although, you don't guide quarterly, but I guess in recent years the first half has been around 45%, 46%, for the full year earnings. Do you expect a similar ratio this year, or is it more back-end loaded? Patrick Shannon : I would see a similar ratio, but just as we kind of highlighted some continued pressure, particularly as it relates to the international regions with the softness in the markets, trying to recover some of the margin deterioration, we experienced in Q4. Americas business will continue to, caught up with the same seasonality of the business from a revenue perspective, as you guys know stronger Q2, Q3, but overall, similar type of profile, but weakness in the international areas. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. Then on the point you just made, you mentioned in APAC the restructuring initiatives, something we can understand what's happening there. Maybe just within the EMEIA region, help us understand, how much of a surprise it was that inflation exceeded price plus productivity in Q4. And maybe what are the measures, if any beyond the Turkey plant relocation that you're implementing in the EMEIA region to turn that business around. Patrick Shannon : Yeah. So if we look at the European business from a margin perspective, in Q4, I'd say, disappointing operational performance. Really driven from weakness in the end markets, particularly in Germany, U.K., we saw some softness. And Germany as you know is a real strong point for our business, particularly in the electronics side, with higher margin profile. So we had somewhat of an unfavorable mix as well, that negatively affected us. And then you throw on top of that, some of the inefficiencies with moving the plant, from Turkey to Poland and just trying to work through that, both from an operational perspective as well as supply chain, third-party providers. We will work through that. And it's going to take sometime. But there's going to be some kind of continued pressure on that. So we'll continue to work through that. Going forward, your question relative to actions, yeah, we will continue to evaluate our business. And size it accordingly to market demand. But that's just the kind of a continuation of what we're going to do to operate the business. So there will be some activity there to recover margins, particularly in the back half of the year. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Chan with Baird. Please go ahead. Josh Chan : Hi, good morning and congrats Mike on the new role. Mike Wagnes : Thanks Josh. Josh Chan : My first question is on the Americas just on your organic guidance for 2020. It looks like the growth is slightly lower than the 2019 growth. But is that mainly due to the price maybe not being up as much and a pretty steady volume type of growth outlook? Just wondering how you're feeling about the cadence of growth in the Americas. Patrick Shannon : So, I feel really good particularly on the performance and in Q4, they put up another strong growth -- organic growth 6.8%. So, I think we're entering 2020 in good shape. All the indicators as Dave highlighted end markets continue to remain strong, particularly in the institutional segment which you know favors our business well. As we look into 2020, it's I think more kind of what you highlighted not as strong of a price profile for 2020 outlook. We'll continue to drive it. But from a material input cost kind of in a deflationary environment, probably won't get as much price in 2020 as what you saw in 2019, but we'll continue to work that. But I would say hey 5% organic growth midpoint of guidance is still strong. It's just -- you also have tougher comps in the back half of the year and so maybe a little conservatism there. But feel good about where we're entering 2020 basis of the markets and how we're performing. Josh Chan : Yes. That's definitely a solid growth there. And my follow-up is on the EMEIA region. You mentioned that the transition from Turkey kind of impacted you in Q4. Just wondering how much of the demand weakness was because of some of that transition. And how much of that would you say was the end markets in the quarter? Dave Petratis : So, good morning Josh. I would -- number one European end markets definitely softened. I think if you look at industrials and automotives which we're particularly strong with that still -- that softened our electronics businesses. And then I'd say general decline in our mechanical side because of regional weakness U.K., Italy, and others. So, clear market weakness. Second is the move from Turkey to Poland a good productivity play for us over the long-term, but we moved a lot of jobs, a lot of tools, change of the supply base and that certainly impacted our ability to serve our customers and drove inefficiencies. I think as you think about 2020, we'll get better every month. But we're talking almost 140 new roles in Poland. Good productivity inside that. But as an old manufacturing guy, we'll get better week-to-week, month-to-month and I think have this operation in pretty good order by midyear. Josh Chan : All right. Thanks Dave, thanks Patrick, and good luck on 2020. Dave Petratis : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Good morning, gentlemen. Mike Wagnes : Hey Andrew. Andrew Obin : Hey Mike. Congrats and Tom are you sure you want back? So, Mike thanks for all the help and Tom looking forward to working with you again. So, a couple of questions. First, in terms of your -- on the electronics side, do you guys have -- we've heard some concerns about second and third-tier suppliers. How comfortable are you guys with your supply chain for the electronic components for the lock business going into first and second quarter given what's happening in China? Dave Petratis : So, we have an outstanding supply chain team here. They've been working with the events in China and the coronavirus. I would say this Andrew. Every week that China stays shut down it will put pressure on our supply chain. Remember we typically produce in region, but we still draw a lot of sourcing out of China. Probably more concerned about second-tier suppliers, providers that could supply subcomponents to final assemblers. So, we're well out in front of us. I think the timing helped us a little bit with the Chinese New Year. We would typically stock up. But again, I looked at some reports yesterday out of China, only about 30% of the industrial workforce is back to work. It's really a function of how quickly this comes back up. Andrew Obin : Got you. So limited... Patrick Shannon : And Andrew, I would just add to that that kind of looking at is, we're not heavily exposed in region obviously, there will be a impact. But globally, you're probably looking at minor disruption in Q1. I think it's more of a Q2 and then the longevity how long does this thing last. And \u2013 but right now for a full year basis the expectation is that there wouldn't be any impact relative to the guide that we've provided here. Andrew Obin : Yeah. I just want to make sure that there's not like one chip that will shut down production line for electronics. Just a question on the electronics, you guys have been doing great. How should I think about business mix for North America given the strength in electronics relative to mechanical, because I would imagine there is margin difference? Thank you. Patrick Shannon : So the margin profile on electronic products both commercial, residential are similar to mechanical, but what you have is a higher average selling price. So there's more EBIT dollars, if you will with that migration and it is a favorable mix for us to the extent we can continue to drive that. And that's some of our incremental investments that we make to drive demand, particularly in electronics to put new products out to the market faster. It's centered around that, because that is a favorable trend in both the industry and for Allegion. Andrew Obin : That's fantastic. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Deepa Raghavan : Hey, good morning. I echo my congrats to Mike and Tom as well. Two questions from me. First is Americas. Resi versus non-resi expectation within Americas organic growth guide, do we assume they both grow at the same rate, or is there perhaps a delta driven by resi having to do some catch-up in the first half? Patrick Shannon : So I would characterize it as \u2013 as you know, we historically don't give specifics around outlooks relative to the residential non-residential businesses. So just take it in aggregate. There will be differences between the businesses as we progress. I would say this. If you kind of look at the residential business the backdrop is more favorable from industry perspective than what we were talking about three to six months ago. So we would expect that to be positive. And then new products like Encode are performing extremely well, and higher electronics growth in resi than the non-resi. So just think about it in those terms. And \u2013 but overall, Americas is performing well from an organic perspective. Deepa Raghavan : Got it. That's helpful. My follow-up is on the incremental investment spend that's $0.15 that you provided. Is that spread \u2013 how is that spread out over the year the $0.15? And also is this all going into the APAC region, or is that more spread out across geographies? Patrick Shannon : No. The majority similar to prior years would be Americas focused. We believe we have a lot of opportunities to continue to invest in the business. Again, it's centered around new product development and channel-specific initiatives where we have underserved markets that we believe we can continue to drive through our channel. So predominantly Americas, and the cadence of that, I would say fairly evenly split as we progress throughout the year is how you should be thinking about it. But overall, $0.15 pretty much in line with what we've experienced in the last couple of years. Deepa Raghavan : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. David MacGregor : Yes. Good morning, everyone. Good luck, Mike. Tom, nice to have you back. I guess David is there anyway of talking about just what you're assuming for growth of the broader markets where you compete in 2020 just some sense of what you've got in your guidance? Dave Petratis : I'd say strong institutional. We continue -- as you think of 2019 to 2020, we actually see that market continue to get stronger, our spec position, our backlogs. So like that with a focus on education those bond issues that we look at across the country are going into security and we like that trend. I think the other significantly more favorable risk and then complemented by electronics the residential market was in the bit of a doldrums in 2019. I think there are some things that step up nicely for Allegion in the Americas as we go into 2020 and which would include new products the full year of Lennar and continued to grab this -- on our team to go out and grow that part of the market. David MacGregor : Encouraging. And I guess is there any way to quantify this Turkey to Poland? There's been a lot of discussion. We've been kind of talking around the point, but is there any way to put some numbers on what that meant to the quarter? And how you're thinking about the potential headwind here in the first half of 2020? Patrick Shannon : So the answer to the latter part of your question, yes, it will continue to be a headwind for the first half of the year and I would expect by Q3, we're at a full run rate perspective in getting the realization of the benefits that we anticipated when we set forth in the move. So i.e. production should be smooth, no disruption in supply chain et cetera. It was a drag on margin in the quarter as well as unfavorable mix and the deleverage associated with the reduction in organic growth. David MacGregor : Thanks. Good luck. Patrick Shannon : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital. Please go ahead. Jeff Kessler : Hi. And again congratulations to Mike and to Tom. Tom, good to have you back again on this side. The -- on the electronics business in the U.S. or in the Americas I should say, can you parse out what areas seem to be providing you with some of the better growth that you're seeing? Is it in NFC? Is it you're beginning to use power over Ethernet? Is it beginning to use other areas of access control or other new products that you have recently developed for doors and entryways or for that matter the use of overture in driving business too? Do you -- can you kind of parse out, what it is on the electronics side that is really -- that's really driving this better-than-expected growth here? Dave Petratis : I think number one a great lineup of capabilities. I think two, you mentioned our spec writing capabilities, but it's really that installed base with technical mastery working with clients could be the University of Michigan, could be Iowa Western Community College, it could be the University of Tennessee. Those products and capabilities come together in a trusted relationships that help us grow. I would say things like ISONAS, our investment in multifamily, which can position itself in college dormitories. It's that trusted position in a market that wants to move keyless that is driving the growth. Jeff Kessler : All right. Dave Petratis : Let me give you one other one too. Encode the first WiFi lock, the battery sustainability there our ability to get through some technical issues. And I think growth on our parts in terms of our mastery to be able to connect into the web of complexity that can appear in the a residential home or a commercial institutional site, it's how things connect our teams have put a lot of work on. And I think as we unload out of the box and connect, we're doing a better job that builds customer loyalty. Jeff Kessler : Okay. Sticking in the same area. When you're talking about your -- more or less the -- on the commercial side of electronics, is it just institutional, or when you look at -- are there areas other -- obviously smaller from -- business from the get-go but perhaps fast-growing healthcare or if you want to call it a strategic or specific new types of logistics, are there areas in those markets where you have particular focus in putting investments and actually getting return on those investments over the next two to three years? Dave Petratis : I think our priority will continue to be heavily institutional focused because of that installed base and our spec writing capability. Our things like the master key system the ID, edge devices are already there. So ability to upgrade that puts us in an A position. I'd say second, really doing I think a nice job on multi-family and mixed-use. You see a lot of movement into the intercity our ability to solve multiple problems for a developer including keyless access has given us some nice growth across the country. Jeff Kessler : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Walsh : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Dave Petratis : Good morning. John Walsh : And thank you to Mike for all the help over the years. I guess first question just looking at the cash balance, obviously you've been growing nicely. You had announced that new share repurchase program. Just wondering if you could talk about the priorities for your uses of cash as we think about 2020 and beyond? Dave Petratis : I would say, our uses of cash has been pretty clear. We like the organic growth especially around the opportunity to seamless access in electronics. Second is M&A. We continue to work extremely hard on deals in what I call the mid-major area. And think about the future of how we can position Allegion stronger for electronics and capabilities that will help us realize this vision of seamless access. And yes, you did see our announcement authorized by the Board to increase the dividend as well as a reload of the stock buyback. Our message is that, we want to make sure that our capital is put to work efficiently. And if that means returning it to shareholders we pull that lever as well. John Walsh : Great. Thank you for that. And then maybe just a question around you mentioned some channel investments there just don't know if you can be any more specific if that's on kind of the specification side of the channel, e-commerce, big box kind of what we should be thinking around kind of the channel investments you highlighted earlier? Dave Petratis : You hit one of them. We continue our specification is one of the strength. Overture would be an investment to help -- give new tools to customers and our spec writer. And then relationship's important there, feet on the street that can help us grow and optimize that tool. Second multi-family, we continue to see a strong market there that we've historically been underpenetrated. And like our electronic offering to be able to grow in that market we put some investments back in res because we see that market responding would be examples of how we're segmenting the market and investing. John Walsh : Great. Thank you. Appreciate the color. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mike Wagnes for any closing remarks. Mike Wagnes : We'd like to thank everyone for participating in today's call and have a great day. Operator : This conference has now concluded.",

Please go to slide 4 and I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave Petratis : Thanks Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Like all responsible global companies, Allegion is closely monitoring and assessing the COVID-19 outbreak, which continues to evolve. We are focused on doing what's right for our employees, customers and communities. We're also maintaining our business health and supporting a central critical infrastructure around the world. Allegion operates within several different critical infrastructure sectors, making our work essential to our customers, and in many cases, their customers. Our people create the security and life safety devices so many others depend on, whether for private homes, government buildings, or medical facilities. We are regularly called on to provide our products and solutions for hospitals and health care facilities, most recently new construction for laboratories that will support the fight against COVID-19. This work gives us clear purpose, especially in these unprecedented times. With the exception of Italy and Mexico, where government health decrees have temporarily paused production, our manufacturing sites may operate. We monitor for demand and material shortages related to COVID-19, taking necessary short-term actions such as adjustments to production to protect the long-term future of Allegion. Such majors are being implemented in a way that minimizes disruption to customers and the overall business. In the case of Italy, we are shipping orders for finished goods with government approval and continue to engage in dialogue with Mexican authorities to open prior to the lifting of its general decree. In the meantime, we are working with our supply chain, existing inventory, and channel partners to fulfill customer requirements for goods normally coming out of Mexico. It remains our intention to continue to serve our customers to the best of our abilities. You've heard me say before, but it bears repeating. We have one of the safest workforces in the world. I could not be prouder of our company of experts who have leveraged our strength and safety to adapt to the current reality. We have faced COVID-19 since mid-January in China and developed operational practices that keep our people safe. We're modeling best practice safe hygiene guidelines based on standards from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We're conducting deep cleaning of our facilities on a regular basis. We're social distancing where we were and we're limiting crowds. We've increased our personal protective equipment and supplies. There's additional cleaning solution, wipes, hand sanitizers throughout our facilities. Employees can ask for PPE supplies like gloves and who're requiring face masks in manufacturing and distribution facilities. We paused all nonessential meetings and visitors, as well as air travel early in the crisis. Essential meetings are encouraged in virtual ways. We're adhering to government decrees and orders and monitoring health conditions, and wherever possible and where necessary, employees are working from home. The strength of Allegion's global supply chain is a major asset and allows us to continue servicing our customers. We have many levers to pull from utilizing safety stocks and inventories to leveraging dual and alternate supply to sharing components across our own facilities and regions. Without doubt, these options that our team have in place are increasing Allegion's credibility and customer loyalty in the marketplace. Of course, our business must be healthy to continue to support our employees, customers, and communities. We have proactively taken actions to mitigate financial implications associated with COVID-19. These actions include reductions in discretionary spending, elimination of nonessential investments, a hiring freeze and reprioritization of all capital expenditures, including a temporary suspension of share repurchases. Importantly, we believe Allegion has an extremely strong balance sheet and liquidity that provides flexibility and positions us well throughout this time. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.6 times at December 31, 2019. We have an undrawn credit facility of up to $500 million if needed and no principal payments due on an outstanding debt until September 22. Our business generates significant cash flow due to industry-leading EBITDA margins and low capital intensity. Allegion's available cash flow conversion to earnings ratio has averaged over 100% as a stand-alone company. Yet there will be challenges ahead. The start of 2020 has made that clear. Allegion can take on great challenges with an engaged, safe, and healthy workforce, financial strength, legacy brands that have stood the test of time, and a steady focus. Allegion will remain true to our values and strong business fundamentals. Please go to Slide 5. Let's turn to the results for the first quarter. We have a strong disciplined supply chain, and our team did an outstanding job navigating the early challenges posed by COVID-19 pandemic as evidenced by the revenue growth we experienced in the quarter. In particular, the Americas had a stellar quarter offset by weakness in Europe and Asia Pacific. The Americas region had reported growth of 7.7% and organic growth of 8.2% in the quarter, driven by both nonresidential and residential businesses. EMEIA markets continue to be soft through the quarter, and our business was further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic impact beginning in March. For Asia-Pacific, Asian markets remained weak, and the region as a whole experienced the COVID-19 impacts as well. Electronics growth in the Americas came in at 12% in the quarter. We continue to see electronics as a long-term positive trend as more and more products become connected for ease of access. The underlying fundamentals of the business are strong and will serve us well as the global pandemic subsides. Adjusted operating margin were up a 190 basis points in the quarter. Margin expansion led by the Americas region, which saw adjusted margins up 270 basis points. EMEIA and Asia-Pacific margins were down due to volume declines in both regions. EMEIA margins were further pressured by continued operational inefficiencies from the move of our operations from Turkey to Poland. We highlighted last quarter our expectation that the impact would carry over in the first half of this year. In the first quarter, adjusted EPS growth came in at a robust 18% and available cash flow was up nearly $44 million versus the prior quarter \u2013 prior year. Overall, I'm very pleased with our Q1 2020 results. That said, the near-term future will be more difficult as we continue to navigate the uncertainty brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, and I expect financial headwinds. Beyond the expense and cash management actions previously discussed, we are implementing cost reduction actions to optimize and simplify the European and Asia-Pacific regions. These actions are intended to address weaker end market fundamentals, enable enhanced customer focus, and will help position these regions for future success. And there's one accounting item to mention. We recognized a $96.3 million non-cash charge related to goodwill and indefinite-lived trade name impairments for our non-U.S. operations predominantly related to the COVID-19 and the expected future impacts. Please go to Slide 6, and I'll take you through the first quarter financial summary. Revenue for the first quarter was $674.7 million, an increase of 3%, inclusive of 4.3% organic growth. Currency headwinds and the impact of the divestitures of our business in Colombia and Turkey offset some of the organic growth. Americas led the way on revenue growth, offsetting the weakness we experienced in EMEIA and Asia Pacific. Patrick will share more detail on the regions in a moment. Adjusted operating margin increased by 190 basis points in the first quarter. As I stated earlier, we saw a significant margin expansion in the Americas with declines in Europe and Asia. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 increased $0.16 or just over 18% versus the prior year. The increase was driven primarily by higher operating income, favorable share count and tax rate offset the increase in other expense. Available cash flow came in at $19 million, an increase of nearly $44 million versus the prior year. Increased adjusted earnings and improvement in net working capital were the driving factors for the increase. Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to wrap-up. Patrick Shannon : Thanks, Dave and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to slide number 7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the first quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 4.3% organic growth in the first quarter led by the Americas region with strong growth in both the non-residential and residential businesses. Price realization was again solid in the quarter more than offsetting material inflation. The impact of the divestiture of our businesses in Colombia and Turkey along with continued currency pressure in EMEIA and Asia-Pacific were headwinds of total growth. Please go to slide number 8. Reported net revenues for the first quarter were $674.7 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 3% versus the prior year up 4.3% on an organic basis. We delivered good price realization and saw a solid volume driven by the Americas region. We experienced an estimated $10 million revenue loss related to COVID-19 during the quarter primarily in our international regions as a result of business closures. Adjusted operating income of $128.2 million increased more than 14% over the same timeframe from last year. Adjusted operating margin of 19% increased 190 basis points. The margin expansion was primarily driven by solid operating leverage on incremental volumes in the Americas along with pricing and productivity outpacing inflation. Headwinds of margin performance include incremental investments which had a 30 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins and an estimated $4 million impact to adjusted operating income related to COVID-19. Please go to slide number 9. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter of 2019 reported earnings per share was $0.84. Adjusting $0.04 for the prior year restructuring expenses and integration costs related to acquisitions, the 2019 adjusted earnings per share was $0.88. Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.16 as favorable price. Operating leverage on incremental volume and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts and unfavorable currency. A year-over-year decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate drove another $0.04 increase. Favorable year-over-year share count increased adjusted earnings per share by another $0.02. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.02 reduction and an increase in other expense drove another negative $0.04 per share impact. This results in adjusted first quarter 2020 earnings per share of $1.04 an increase of $0.16 or 18.2% compared to the prior year. Lastly, we had a $1.04 per share reduction for charges primarily related to goodwill and indefinite-live trade name impairments. These charges were related to COVID-19 and its impact on expected future results. After giving effect to these onetime items you arrive at first quarter 2020 reported earnings per share of $0. Please go to slide number 10. First quarter revenues for the Americas region were $502.1 million up 7.7% on a reported basis and up 8.2% organically. The growth was driven by solid price realization and strong volume. Both the non-residential and residential businesses grew high single-digits. The business saw a growth across all product segments and verticals particularly in institutional end markets. The electronics growth for the quarter was 12%. Electronic products continue to be a long-term growth driver as consumers and end users value the connectivity and convenience they offer over their mechanical counterparts. The overall growth in the Americas reflects the company's strong position in the market as well as the returns associated with incremental investments in new product development and channel strategies. Americas adjusted operating income of $146.6 million increased 19.1% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 270 basis points. Volume leverage on the revenue increase along with price and productivity significantly exceeding inflation drove the substantial margin expansion. The team continues to deliver solid cost leverage and productivity to further improve operating performance in our competitive position. Lastly, incremental investments were a 40 basis point decrease on margins. Please go to slide number 11. First quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $129.9 million down 9.1% and down 6.2% on an organic basis. The lower volume was driven by continued weakening in end markets across the region and COVID-19 impacts, primarily, in the southern region. The impact of the divestiture of the business in Turkey and currency headwinds also contributed to the reported revenue decline. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $3.3 million decreased 71.8% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased by 570 basis points. Also, during the quarter inflation exceeded price plus productivity. Revenue declines had a negative impact on operating margin, and we continue to experience cost pressure associated with the plant relocation from Turkey to Poland. Earlier in April, we announced cost reduction initiatives aimed at optimizing and simplifying our operations, improving our customer service, as well as addressing the cost structure in our non-U.S. locations. These are not specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, but part of our long-range business planning process. Please go to slide number 12. First quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $32.7 million, down 11.1% versus the prior year. Organic revenue was down 4.9%. The decline was driven by continued weakness in Australian end markets, primarily residential as well as impacts related to COVID 19. Total revenue continued to be affected by currency headwinds. Asia-Pacific adjusted operating loss for the quarter was $1.6 million, a decrease of $0.9 million with adjusted operating margins down 300 basis points versus the prior year period. Significant volume declines and unfavorable mix had a large impact on the reduced income and margin. Of note, we did have approximately $95 million in impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite live trade names. These charges were related to COVID-19 and its impact to expected future results. As with the EMEIA region, the cost reduction actions announced earlier in April will have a favorable impact on operations in Asia-Pacific. These actions are also the result of our long-range business planning and not specific to COVID-19 impacts. Please go to slide number 13. Year-to-date available cash flow for the first quarter of 2020 came in at $19 million, which is an increase of nearly $44 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by higher adjusted net earnings and improvements in net working capital. Looking at the chart at the bottom of the slide, it shows working capital as a percent of revenues decreased based on a four point quarter average. On a year-over-year point in time basis, working capital as a percent of revenue is down 220 basis points. This was driven by accelerated turnover in both inventory and receivables. As always, we remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to minimize investments in working capital in order to continue to drive substantial cash flow conversion. Please go to slide number 14. This slide provides an update on our capital structure. As you can see, our leverage has dropped steadily over the past five years and we ended 2019 at 2.1 times gross leverage and 1.6 times net leverage to adjusted EBITDA. In looking at our debt maturity profile, we do not have any loans maturing until September 2022. We also have a $500 million untapped credit facility should we need additional liquidity. Our balance sheet is in a strong position and our high level cash flow conversion provides us flexibility and optionality to run the business going forward. These same strengths have led Allegion to six consecutive years of annual increase in dividends and our most recent dividend increase of nearly 19% announced in February remains intact. During the first quarter, the company repurchased approximately $94 million of stock. Due to the uncertainties related to the pandemic, we have placed repurchase plans on hold and we will review further as the year progresses. I will now hand it back over to Dave to wrap-up. Dave Petratis : Thank you, Patrick. Please go to slide number 15. We recently announced that we were withdrawing our outlook for 2020 based on the magnitude and uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. We respect the need for financial guidance for the analyst community and shareholders. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing. Health care experts are still learning about the virus and there is tremendous speculation on the economic recovery and the path it will take. The many unknowns include the scope and effect of further government regulatory, fiscal monetary and public health responses. Our update will come when we release Q2 2020 results. The fundamentals of Allegion are strong. And as the world adapts to the new normal, we should have more clarity on the rest of 2020 at that time. We do expect that COVID-19 will have a near-term negative financial impact on the business, including the reduction in year-over-year revenues, operating profit and cash flow due to government decrees and softening demand. With that said, Allegion's sound fundamental business strength provides some resiliency in times of economic downturn, and our long-term investment thesis remains unchanged. For the past several years, we have delivered above-market organic growth, the strength of our channel relationships, new product development, large installed base brand and market positions have helped us continually drive higher organic growth than the market. Since spin, Allegion has delivered a 5.4% organic revenue CAGR. In the first quarter, the company grew organically at 4.3% with the Americas at 8.2%. Our strategy of seamless access takes full advantage of the keyless and connected technologies increasingly demanded in our industry. The electronic products needed to facilitate these demands continue to be a long-term growth driver for the company. The Americas business experienced 12% growth in electronics in Q1. Even with the growth we have seen in these products, since we became a stand-alone company, adoption is still in the early stages. Therefore, the industry conversion opportunity remains robust. Although, Allegion has industry-leading EBIT margins, our focus on price realization productivity and cost management allows us to expand margins when volumes are up like the 170 basis point increase we produced in Q1, but also facilitates the margin profile to be resilient through economic cycles. Our strong balance sheet, low capital requirements in tandem with a high level of cash flow conversion our business generates allows us to have capital allocation optionality. We are well within our debt covenants and have no near-term debt repayments. For the six full years, that Allegion has been a stand-alone company, the conversion of net income to available cash flow has on average exceeded 100%. The COVID pandemic has caused worldwide disruption in economic markets, whether haltering growing economies or furthering softening ones that were in decline. Nonetheless, we feel that our company is set up well to weather the storm and our strong fundamentals will serve us well when the pandemic subsides. Allegion has the right people in place to help ensure this. Our employees have shown a great deal of adaptability during these uncertain times. I could not be prouder of our people. Our management acted early to mitigate the economic impact. Our supply chain has proven itself to be flexible, proficient and dependable and we are positioned to continue leveraging as a strength moving forward. And of course, our legacy brands have stood the test of time and delivered incredible value. Allegion is strong, its people are resilient and we remain focused and disciplined. I do want to thank every member of the Allegion team on a successful Q1 2020. Everyone stay safe and healthy. And now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Tim Wojs from Baird. Please go ahead. Tim Wojs : Hey, gentlemen, good morning. Hope everybody is well. Dave Petratis : Good morning. Patrick Shannon : Good morning. Tim Wojs : Maybe if -- just my first question. Maybe if we can just add a little bit color particularly in Americas of how the demand trajectory you saw kind of trended through the quarter? And maybe, if you could give us just some flavor of how April has trended here, just to give us an idea what Q2 and kind of the near-term may look like? Dave Petratis : Glad to do that. I would say first, the company got on to COVID-19 response early with a focus on our supply chain and protecting our people with a strategy for us to gain market share in Q1. So, we went extremely strong through the first quarter. I think that's reflected in our Americas results, and the strength, our ability to keep our supply chain strong. As we got into March, we saw a slight decline in the last two weeks. But again, we had our foot on the gas, and we communicated that. As we moved into April, we're 17 days into this. I think the things that we're seeing are rather predictable. We see some softness in the overall residential. I would say we have a view into point-of-sale in the bid box, and I'd say it's off low-teens. And as I look at that, I'd say, yes, that probably makes sense. Second, I think from a positive standpoint, our -- we see softness in bookings in the commercial and institutional. Our backlog is strong. We see the continuation of construction projects and we think if ground's broken, if permits are issued, these projects are going to roll in. As I came into work this morning, I see construction continue to move forward. The last thing I'd add Tim is our specs and quotes continue to be very positive. I know you can spec yourself and quote yourself right off a cliff, but it's a positive indicator. That work continues to roll. Tim Wojs : Okay. Okay. Is that -- as you guys look into maybe the back half of this year and into 2021, is that really the part of your leading indicator or what might give you confidence that COVID is really more of kind of a temporary issue as opposed to something maybe more cyclical for non-residential construction in general? Dave Petratis : I think you've got to be more critical than people would call it a V. I think the construction pipeline that we have today again, projects that are approved and are in progress will roll. I've got uncertainty about 2021 commercial and institutional. Commercial is going to be soft. I think that's where the strength of our spec writing, our wholesale channels, whatever the market gives us at Allegion, we expect to do better than the market. Patrick Shannon : Thanks, Tim. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Hope everyone is well. Thanks for that color and also just trying to now kind of think about -- since we're all going to make our assumptions here, could you give us a little additional thought on decrementals and how linear or not linear the relationship is in other words, if revenues are down 10, what do you think the decrementals might be? And if they're down 20, what they might be and frame it however you like, but we've all got to kind of take a shot here at what's coming at us and try to put a stake in the ground in terms of an earnings estimate. Patrick Shannon : Yes. So, the big question mark, I think Jeff relates to what's on the demand horizon. And as we've highlighted, very difficult to predict just kind of given the government decrees, and as we've highlighted we have a couple of plant closures today that will inhibit us a little bit on the top side and also will provide some cost pressure just from an under absorption perspective near term. As I think about it, and you try to run some correlations to prior cycles that type of thing, I mean, everyone knows a way it was pretty drastic, I think it's too early to make some comparisons to that. Right now, we're still -- as everyone else is collecting data from economists and a lot of people have different opinions, but as I think about it related to Allegion, some couple of points I'd like to highlight why I think we're better positioned than perhaps we were at the last downturn for several reasons. Number one, we have a much stronger business franchise, a lot better stronger portfolio of businesses. As you know, we've divested poor-performing businesses. We added businesses to our portfolio that I think are more resilient in a downturn and less susceptible to market downturns. This whole convergence of electronics is a -- you kind of look back 10 years ago, it wasn't a big driver in the business and whereas today it is a driver, it's growing at 1.5 times to 2 times the market today, and as you know we continue to put up really good numbers related to that. So, I think that's an item that needs to -- or will continue to grow and will be a continued focus for us going forward. And as you know, it's a higher average selling price similar margin, which means more EBIT dollars. The channel investments we've made, particularly in the repair retrofit market discretionary markets, we have a much broader product portfolio to serve our customers in that segment. And I think we're better positioned to participate in that market segment, whereas at time of spin we weren't, I think that will be good for us going forward. And then to your question on the margin profile, we would say historically, we've been able to adjust our cost profile. We can react pretty quickly. We historically have shown some margin decrements related to the last cycles, if you kind of go back to 2008, small margin deterioration. We adjusted our cost position fairly aggressively. Pricing we will continue to push that lever. It was a good driver for us in the quarter. So, I would say maybe some margin pressure, but not substantial relative to where we are. And if you think about where we are today, we're at a high watermark. Again, we had another record Q1 performance, up 190 basis points. And so, we're coming from peak margin performance, and we'll continue to take the actions necessary to address our cost base. We talked about those eliminating the discretionary spend, hiring freeze kind of re-prioritization of essential investments, you will see a reduction in some of the incremental investment, but we'll be focused on long-term areas. And so I just -- we'll see how things kind of pan out here, but I think it's going to be more demand-driven and we'll adjust our cost profile to meet future demand both at the factory and SG&A level. Jeff Sprague : Thanks. And as an unrelated second question. Just on the good will, it's awful early in the COVID. It sounds like you're kind of using that as a kind of a justification for knocking out that goodwill. It sounds like -- but you've really beyond kind of COVID made a clear judgment that those acquisitions just have not lived up the snuff. And I just wonder if any of the other acquisitions in Europe or anything as you've gone through this goodwill testing are kind of close to being on the bubble here? Dave Petratis : So Asia-Pacific as we indicated a write-down there goodwill and indefinite-live assets which pretty much releases the entire balance there. I think there's a de-minimis amount that remains. As we kind of talked about in Q4 the pressure there really given from the Australian market and just weak end-market fundamentals. And so we re-looked at that particularly given the COVID-19 which really accelerated the market decline, kind of as we look at it going forward and so put us in a position to kind of do that analysis which is kind of a discounted cash flow et cetera. When we look at Europe there is some cushion left there. We didn't need to take an impairment. I think hopefully, we took a conservative view on the discounted cash flow and hopefully, we're okay. But time will tell and we'll see where this pans out going forward. But again end markets continued weakness particularly in Southern Europe. But I feel really good about our electronics business there in the Germanic area. You mentioned acquisitions. SimonsVoss has been a home run for us. And I think there's some good growth opportunity there going forward. So again we'll kind of reevaluate as the year progresses and we'll see what happens when the fog lifts. Patrick Shannon : I'd add one other comment. If you think about the Asia-Pacific, our acquisition profile has been Australia and one acquisition in Korea. All of those markets were in free fall in the second half of 2019 through the COVID-19 and it's hard to retain that goodwill on the books. Jeff Sprague : Okay. Thanks for the color. Thanks a lot. Patrick Shannon : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Obin Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Hi, good morning. Patrick Shannon : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : I'm just wondering so the first question I have, how should I think about your ability to release working capital in this environment because a lot of companies are telling us that they're going to run-off inventories run for cash. But my understanding also is that a lot of your product in the U.S. is highly customized. So how should I think about your ability to release working capital in second and third quarter as the COVID-19 sort of sweeps through the U.S. as well I guess? Patrick Shannon : Yes. Most companies with downturns would show a higher cash conversion net earnings because of the runoff in working capital. I think we'll be no different in that situation. However, I just remind everyone our working capital as a percent of revenue is fairly low; 4-point average, we're at like 6% of revenue. So there's not a lot of room there for significant cash flow conversion on further reductions in working capital. And actually, Q1 we made substantial progress in both inventory turns and receivable DSO. So there's probably a little improvement there, but I wouldn't look at it as a significant opportunity and further cash flow generation for us, just kind of given where we are relative to maybe other industrial companies. Dave Petratis : I'd add to that too. That one of our objectives coming through the first quarter was to have the right inventory. And we made some investments there. As we go through the summer here, we'll probably run a little stronger on finished good inventories as an opportunity. The strength of our supply chain and the ability to get the component parts into the right products where we need them, I think gives us an advantage. And then I'll use that advantage in some inventories to try and get orders to help the business. Andrew Obin : And the second question, I have sort of unrelated. But given that a lot of municipalities are shut down, how do you deal with the whole -- how does the industry deal with the whole permitting process? And what does it mean for the construction activity in the summer both in residential and institutional space? Thank you. Dave Petratis : I think you've got to keep an eye on permits. You've got to assume that that will -- the permitting processes that run through government will slow down. I think though two -- when -- whether it's institutional or commercial housing when people want to commit capital, they'll force that process to move forward. But as you well know permits is a key indicator for us, we'll keep an eye on it. And see where that trend goes. I think today Andrew, from a -- you could think about, if we in fact do go into recovery, the permit process the ability to do that will loosen up. It's been how is, capital deployed to be able to go out and drive this industry. Andrew Obin : So, you think its economic activity driving permitting process. And if economy improves permitting logjam will improve as well. Dave Petratis : Yeah. Andrew Obin : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Please go ahead. David MacGregor : Hey, good morning, everyone. Just -- hope you're well. Just wanted to ask about the strength of the North American volume here in the first quarter and there's been various observations for different people in the industry about, pull forward particularly in the case of education, but maybe in some healthcare applications as well. And I'm just wondering if you're able to characterize the degree to which you may have pulled forward revenue from the summer quarters here in 1Q? Dave Petratis : We announced a price increase. So we would get some natural pull through, as a result of that. But I'd say, generally if you look could across North America a rather mild winter, I think and we executed, at a high level. And we picked up opportunities, in the quarter that others could not serve. So I'd say a robust market, really in Q4 and Q1, you've got the electronics driver. And I think the strength of Allegion is shown hard. And the price increase pulled forward slight demand which I like, as we go through Q2 to be able to serve the local markets. David MacGregor : Okay. I guess, just as a follow-up, you're undertaking restructuring in Europe. I know you've been working on Turkey for a while now. We talked about that last quarter, again this quarter. And those things never happen quickly, I understand. But when you think about sort of the disparate nature of -- from scale and a profitability and a growth standpoint between the North American business, and what you're doing now or what you have been doing recently, in Europe and in Asia, I guess, the question at a high level is do you need to be in Asia and Europe? Or would this be a stronger business if you were just solely in North American business? And as a part of that, maybe if you could talk about the extent to which North American results may benefit to some degree from being in Europe and Asia? Thank you. Dave Petratis : I would say, it again the adjustments that we made in the quarter with the restructuring announcement will strengthen those franchises. I think, both regions -- I'd also emphasize I've been very clear that we lack scale outside of North America. I think the moves that we're making allow us to focus, where we can win rip out cost that we think will simplify the business. And continue to sharpen our focus on, what we call seamless access. There is some complementary nature to the Australia/New Zealand business, especially along residential which is still developing. And I think our, SimonsVoss, Interflex business, which we've been extremely pleased with gives us a looking glass into a seamless access. And again, I think we look to Allegion to have more focus on where this business is going deploy more human and financial capital into that seamless access experienced as we compete wherever, we're at in the world. David MacGregor : Great, thanks very much gentlemen. Stay well. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning, guys. Dave Petratis : Good morning. Josh Pokrzywinski : Dave, just on the pipeline of spec writing that you mentioned was fairly strong. Did folks use this opportunity, or if you look back at other points in time where we've had kind of pauses in activity? Is there kind of a natural lag where, everyone says, okay, here's something I was working on. But I'm going to rethink it and maybe that adds, three or six months to kind of the recovery time frame where there is just an air pocket. Is that the way you guys have experienced it in the past? And how should we think about kind of like a natural delay as folks kind of get back to work. And the economy reopens, or does activity continue throughout on the spec writing side? Dave Petratis : So Josh, this is my seventh little disruption in the economy, since I began my career in 1980. So I think the experiences give you some strength as you go through this. There will be an air pocket. And that's what we're trying to understand. Our bids our quote activity specs we track that in terms of the dollar level of activity. But you can actually have specs kick back and say, \"Hey let's revalue engineer this.\" You can't look at this current situation and say, \"Hey there's going to be an air pocket of demand activity because of all supply chain factors, spec writing quotation, wholesale activity, construction, other supply challenges on the construction side. So, it's a part of our thinking. But I think as a lead indicator that spec writing is a clear strength of Allegion and it will help us as we navigate through this. Josh Pokrzywinski : That's helpful. And then unrelated and kind of back to the Jeff's question on decrementals. If I look back to the same business or at least most of it under Ingersoll ownership back in 2009, the margin expansion during that timeframe on a pretty significant revenue decline was pretty phenomenal hundreds of basis points. Obviously, a higher starting point today. So, not all those levers are available. Can -- but Dave or Patrick, can you just remind us some of what happened since then? And maybe what if those actions can be revisited or reexamined today versus stuff that was maybe more of kind of a one-time realignment of the cost base? Patrick Shannon : I would characterize it this way entering the 2008 financial crisis there was probably more options to reduce the cost profile particularly on manufacturing footprint. I think IR at the time was fairly aggressive in closing certain factories related to the security technologies business at that time that helped protect the margin profile. Pricing was another lever I think was pushed pretty hard. You kind of have to look at it over the 2008-2010 timeframe. And if I remember correctly, it showed a slight margin decrement over that time period. I would characterize today relative to going into the situation where a better franchise stronger portfolio of businesses that you can maybe protect ourselves more on the topline side. And again we are taking the appropriate actions to reduce our cost structure. Dave talked about actions we're taking in international arena. Yes, we're doing things here to tighten the belt. Obviously, in Americas, we'll continue to do that and adjust to future demand. I would say quite frankly we don't maybe have as many levers to pull. But having said that, I wouldn't expect a significant margin degradation relative to where we are today. So, dollars will come down basis of demand, i.e. topline, but margin percent we'll do what we can to try to maintain that. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Appreciate the color and best of luck guys. Patrick Shannon : And let me -- so one other quick thing is probably worth noting is that short-term again given the governmental decrees and the fact that some of our facilities are closed, I mean you're going to have it's going to be a lot more choppy right? I mean you kind of have to -- if you're talking about margin profile; you need to really look at it over a 12-month period. You're always going to get hit initially. Immediately you make adjustments and then you start to kind of level out. And so just kind of keep that in mind as you're thinking through this. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Will do. Appreciate that. Operator : The next question comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Dave Petratis : Good morning John. John Walsh : Hi, good morning and glad to hear everyone is well. Wanted to follow-up on to that question. Clearly, you're getting ahead on the cost action. Is there a way to quantify how much is kind of structural? You did make the comment that some of it would have been done regardless of COVID-19 and then kind of those variable cost actions. Just wondering what might come back if -- as volume returns paying employees et cetera things like that? Patrick Shannon : So, there are variable components relative to our cost structure as you would expect in any business and it could be anything from the way that we have our pricing structure kind of volume rebates, for example, you can look at things like salesmen commissions those type of things naturally will come down and correspond with the volume decrease. The things that we're adjusting now some of the discretionary spend really relooking at some of our things relative to investments. And making sure that we went through a re-prioritization of those that's really focused on things that matter so that we're coming out of this stronger particularly on revenue growth opportunities associated with electronics. So, we're taking that into consideration. But collectively these variable costs I mean it's tens of millions is how I would -- if you're looking for a type of a magnitude. We will give you more color as in Q2 as Dave mentioned when we have a better kind of outlook on revenue but it's fairly significant. Dave Petratis : I would add the announced restructuring we saw significant softening in Asia Pacific and in areas of Europe as we exited the second half of 2019. We were not pleased with our position and we took actions regardless of the COVID-19 and a pandemic does not. The other thing I would say, when you're in the construction-related industries you do have variation in demand and Allegion's ability to adjust our cost structure, I think can be seen over the last 20 years and we'll be making the moves that help keep this business strong. John Walsh : Great. And then maybe one about end markets. So I guess the Cares Act fixed somewhat of a bonus depreciation glitch that wasn't part of the tax plan. Wondering if you're hearing from folks that with the QIP adjustment that they're more willing to do interior improvements or if that's something that's nice, but just given the severity of what's happening right now it's not enough to kind of offset some of the demand? Dave Petratis : I'm not aware of that feature of the Cares Act. I'm sure that the people here at Allegion if we feel that's an opportunity we'll go after it. So I can't give you a good response to that one. John Walsh : Okay. Thanks for the color. I appreciate it. Dave Petratis : Okay, John. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Patrick Shannon : Good morning. Joe Ritchie : Yeah. Just -- maybe just starting off I know a lot of the questions so far have been on the forward. But maybe just going back to 1Q for a second, clearly the margins in Americas I mean this is your best 1Q margins by a long shot. I'm just wondering was there anything either like one-time-ish that came through in the quarter, or maybe you can elaborate a little bit more on like pricing this quarter? And how you expect that to hold up as the year progresses? Patrick Shannon : Yeah. So nothing unusual in the quarter that accelerated the margin improvement. It's the old blocking and tackling and execution. The team did a great job. We went into the year, I'd say with a really healthy pipeline of productivity activity around both material and the factory. We got great volume leverage on the incremental volume. And then you add on top of that price was good particularly in the commercial segment we're going to continue to drive that. And so everything played out, and again no real big surprises, but the team really kind of continued to drive good execution all around. Dave Petratis : I'd go back even farther Joe. As we exited 2018 as a leadership team, we felt we left margin on the table. We put a pipeline of activities and in 2019 that we worked on throughout the year and we picked up strength as we went into the second half of 2019 and 2020 that strengthened the business. Patrick Shannon : The other comment I just mentioned too on the input costs. So think about commodity prices, they've come down. So year-over-year there was some benefit there where we didn't have any inflation on the material side. Joe Ritchie : Got it. No, that makes sense. But Patrick is that something that's going to continue as the year progresses as well? I mean it can -- and how sticky you think the pricing will be? Patrick Shannon : Yeah. Basis of the current cost for steel, zinc, copper, brass et cetera that will continue throughout the course of the year, yes. Joe Ritchie : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe my one follow-up. Going back into several years, several quarters, the level of outgrowth you saw this quarter relative to your biggest competitor based in Europe in the Americas was I think like higher than any other quarter that we've seen. I guess, I'm curious if maybe you can elaborate what you're doing or the effect of the share gains that you're seeing specifically this quarter? And if -- I know we're all trying to figure out what the demand environment is going to be like, but should you continue to outpace your peers in this downturn? Dave Petratis : So, I think number one, I'll give you a sports analogy. Why did the Patriots roll up six championship, six rooms same head coach, great quarterback, good offensive strategy. If you look at our competitors over the last 24 months, quite a bit of turnover at the top. A lot of management change. One of the strengths of Allegion is our experience. We have a system of management here that we're pretty disciplined to. It doesn't mean it's perfect. But I think the strength of the leadership team the knowledge that cascades through our business and some favorable markets regionally in the country helped us to continue to put up growth that we have built on over the last six years. So a combination of things there. I think the electronics as well is another -- this is an industry trend and we continue to prioritize our investments to take advantage of that opportunity. And I think it will continue to reward us Joe. Patrick Shannon : And I'll add Joe too, to be fair on the analysis. So we did have a little bit easier comparison on residential. You may recall, we had some channel difficulties in Q1 last year. Those obviously have been worked through. We continue to get really good electronics growth. And we added a substantial customer on the new construction Lennar that helped our year-over-year comparisons as well. Joe Ritchie : Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks guys. Patrick Shannon : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just wanted to double check again the mix of business. So within the Americas, if you could just remind us in terms of 2019 split, let's say how much -- within the resi and non-resi pieces of the business, how much of each of those was related to new build versus aftermarket or replacement activity for Allegion? Dave Petratis : So we would say, it's around 50-50 collectively across the entire portfolio. Julian Mitchell : I see. Patrick Shannon : Hey, Julian, you'd want to think that the non-residential is a little heavier I think on the new construction versus the aftermarket and then it's flipped on the residential, but then it nets out to about 50-50. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. And how much related to that of your resi sales are going via the big box channel nowadays? Patrick Shannon : So it's a about a third 40% of the business 50% maybe up to 50%. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. And then my second question would following up on that question from Joe around pricing and productivity. So those items were I think almost a 200-point tailwind to margins in the first quarter year-on-year. Based on your comments, should we assume that that remains a very strong tailwind for the next nine months, perhaps not quite at the level of Q1, but should be a material contributor? Patrick Shannon : Yes. I think we'll have -- we'll continue to have a tailwind there. But again, some of the issues associated with the closure reduced demand et cetera we'll put some pressure on those comparisons. Julian Mitchell : Understood. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Jeffrey Kessler from Imperial Capital. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Kessler : Thank you. Hope you guys are doing well. Patrick Shannon : And you too. Jeffrey Kessler : A quick question on the -- looking at the channel, the integration and the installation channel, we've been seeing that there is continuation of big projects going on. There are some problems in getting people on to sites at some of the midsized projects. And obviously when they get on, they have to be wearing the types of PPE and things like that that are mandated by the local ordinances. And in some places, the smaller SMB market seems to be shut down completely. Can you make some comments on how your -- what you're getting back from your installers and integrators with regard to their ability to do work on projects what's continuing where -- what's out there where there's some restriction on their ability to get to the site and what's out there which is completely closed down? Dave Petratis : I think it's clearly a step back in terms of being able to go in service install. Here at Allegion, we have a policy. Visitors are highly controlled. We don't want infection. With that said, it depends on where you're at. The Dallas market continues to be very active. We are moving around college campuses, but it's not going to happen in New York City. It certainly could happen in Denver. So again, it depends on where you're at and it puts an air pocket into the work. So I actually think if things straighten themselves out, there'll be a pickup in intensity short term. And over time, it schedules itself out. I do think the normal project activity that we have typically that goes on college campuses will roll to schedule, which is really May through August. It's an important driver for us. Could be moved up a little early, if access is there, but it depends on where you're at geographically Jeff. Jeffrey Kessler : Okay. Dave Petratis : Higher infection rates, more difficult access. Jeffrey Kessler : I see. We'll see what happens at West over the next few weeks. Second thing is, do you -- what investments have you made? And I know you've made some in the past with regard to obviously collaborative spec writing, if you want to call that in the cloud, touchless access NFC things like that. Are you in a position to take market share because of number one touchless access. Number two, some of the \u2013 let's just call it, some of the newer investments that you've made in trying to \u2013 in trying to just make the process easier for your customers. Is that something that that can continue a market share gain in the \u2013 at least in the Americas for the moment because it seems to have been \u2013 have worked at least over the last year or so? Dave Petratis : I believe if you look at our overall growth, the investments that we're making in collaborative tools Overture, which we'll continue to invest and develop. Overture has been rolled out in the bulk of the world as a collaborative working tool and it's been extremely well received by our partners, spec writers architects and they have been collaborative in the creation of Overture. So I really give Tim Eckersley credit to creating that. We continue to invest in the electronics side of this. I think you may have seen Jeff our investment in open path as a partnership and investment that we think will help expand the world of seamless access. Schlage Sense [ph] would be another and our continued investment in electronics and new products. We also brought together SimonsVoss and Interflex under one leadership team, because we believe that that's a looking glass into seamless access. And our growth there in electronics in the DAC region is gaining share. So I think you've got the right sense in that collaborative tools, electronics and seamless access is going to help us as we go through this crisis and come out the other end. Jeffrey Kessler : Is that at the margin, or is that something that can actually really move the needle as we come out of this recession? Dave Petratis : I think the drivers of seamless access keyless activity simplifying the world that our customers live in eliminating master keys and intelligence that goes with seamless access is going to be a driver for the next two decades. Jeffrey Kessler : Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Dave Petratis : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Deepa Raghavan from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Deepa Raghavan : Hey, good morning. Dave you touched a little bit on the restrictions on construction site actually impacting project activity, especially you mentioned institutional. Now institutionally we've always considered it long tail in nature and more defensive as we go into a down cycle. Now, does that dynamic now make it less defensive this down cycle? And the other \u2013 extending that question, if site access continue to be restricted through this construction selling season, does it mean you can \u2013 you're able to recover beyond fall or in winter season, or you think that's been now pushed to the next construction season which is next summer? Dave Petratis : So I like our position in institutional. I was looking last night. 22 of the states have \u2013 are generally in pretty good financial shape. Infrastructure has aged. We still have the driver of security in public settings. So you got to like that. And then our spec activity would also suggest that that this whole market continued to develop. With that said, an earlier question described an air pocket, we're going to have to have our eyes wide open and understand that air pocket. Part of it is you get some immediate shock. Second is it's that snowplow effect that we've talked about in the past, projects will get pushed out but we may see that air pocket again as we moved into 2021 because budgets are a little bit tighter. So to be seen, I like our institutional position. It's been \u2013 in my 40 years, the institutional markets have always been a good place to operate and we'll try and get more than our share out of whatever market is there. Deepa Raghavan : Got it. So can you talk about your Mexico and the Italy plant closures, I mean what percent of sales is coming from those two regions? And when you talk about working with your channel partners to ensure demand is wholesale, does it entail higher costs? Patrick Shannon : So, I'll take a stab at the revenue base. I mean just to kind of put it into perspective on Mexico. That's predominantly the supplier for our residential business. Here in Americas, which we've characterized it's about a third of the overall Americas portfolio. Keep in mind, the decree was extended through the end of May. However, we are -- we've got inventory on hand. We're working with our distribution partners to ensure customers can be served. When that comes back online there will be a restocking in the channels for the depletion of the inventory. So we're kind of working that. But I think that the message is near term you're going to see a decline and obviously in revenue for some piece of that certainly in Q2. Italy, again, the data I think on that is May three is the current decree. We will see that is subject to change based on what the government dictates. That might be kind of call it 20% of our portfolio in Europe. We are shipping finished goods inventory out of the warehouse there in Italy today. So that activity is taking place. It's just the production, manufacturing, et cetera right now that were inhibited from producing anything. However, it doesn't necessarily mean we're losing business. I think it just means delays deferrals that type of thing because the reality is the customers are closed also. And so they don't have the ability to be able to receive inventory. And so this is just going to be a deferral, and we'll see how quickly that may or may not pick up in the back half of this year. Dave Petratis : Pete, I have to give a shout out to our Italian teams. We operated safely longer there than many manufacturers. Same in Mexico. We got a few extra days until that decree came down working hard to petition the government now to consider it's essential. I believe in Mexico we can keep our people safer than they are on the streets. And so we're pushing that. Again, we've got a good supply of residential inventory on the shelf. And if we can cut through this, we're going to be in good shape. Patrick Shannon : All right, Jason? Operator : Yeah. There are no more questions in the queue. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Martineau for any closing remarks. Thomas Martineau : I appreciate it. So we'd like to thank everyone for participating in today's call. And today more than ever please have a safe day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Dave and Patrick will now discuss our second quarter 2020 results, which will be followed by a Q&A session. We have a very tight meeting today. Please for the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and short follow-up and then reenter the queue. We will like to give everyone an opportunity given the time allotted. Please go to slide 4 and I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave Petratis : Thanks Tom. Good morning thank you for joining us today. 2020 will go down as a year of dramatic change. The health and economic impact of COVID-19 will take the head one along side the social concerns related to inclusion and diversity. With these challenges comes needed reflection. Before I turn to business results, I'd like to address these events and Allegion's response to them. The tragedy of George Floyd's death has been on my mind, as well as the deaths of many who have preceded him. Black lives matter, black lives matter and we must level the playing field, understand bias and work for equality. Prejudice and racism are intolerable and we can and must do better. My executive leadership team has joined me in a journey of listening, learning and reflection and will continue building the right roadmap for Allegion. With our employees, we must also help build a better world with our voices, our minds, our hands and our hearts. I expect the people of the Allegion in our businesses to be involved to create positive change in our community and our company. And you can expect the same of me. This is the spirit and culture of Allegion. And determining how we respond to social concerns our value and code of conduct has been our lighthouse since the creation of Allegion. And they will help us to improve inclusion and diversity at the company. In a similar way, our values and corporate business strategy has provided the foundation to respond to COVID-19 pandemic, which will be with us for some time to come Please go to Slide 5. You can equip with a culture of safety and resilient supply chain and operational discipline, Allegion was in a position of strength facing the pandemic. Keeping our employees safe and healthy continues to be top of mind, and we're effectively leveraging safety and health as our true number throughout these uncertain times. My leadership team led the COVID-19 effort to ensure our company was responding in real time to considerable global complexity. And to meet the needs of our employees, customers, communities and other stakeholders, as well as requests from public health officials. Cross-functional teams guided our health and safety efforts, production and operational decisions, work from home infrastructure and best practices. We also created an Allegion safety net program giving production workers an extra day of pay per month to cover unexpected illnesses or family needs. I'm proud of the collaboration and communication between functions which has been key to working productively and safely wherever we are. At the same time, Allegion has turned his attention to giving back to communities across the world while ensuring our employees had mask, we've also been able to donate thousands of mask to healthcare workers across the U.S, Mexico and Italy, knowing that people have a safe place to live is perhaps more important than ever. We've also continued our substantial commitment to habitat for humanity in 2020. There is no doubt our team members across the world are dedicated to serving others and doing the right thing. And taking care of our team members' means they can in turn take care of their communities. Please go to Slide 6. Our enterprise excellence and discipline capital allocation strategies have served us well to weather the COVID-19 storm. We are delivering new value in access and safety as people deal with the realities of daily life in a pandemic. Our vision of seamless access and a safer world has never been more important. As an expert in security, Allegion customers look for us to support specific guidance when faced with new challenges. In the age of COVID-19 for example new attention was brought to their need for a healthy environment in a variety of ways. First, proper cleaning and disinfecting procedures for door hardware. Second, surface technologies like silver ion antimicrobial coatings and new technologies with antibacterial and antiviral properties. Third, our touchless solutions are at the forefront of helping prevent the spread of viruses and reducing common physical touch points. From automatic door opening solutions and contactless readers to innovative door poles, our products can help avoid hand to surface contact. Further by integrating our wave to open and other innovations with identity management partners, we're able to enable seamless access through our partners of choice strategy. Fourth, our keyless solutions around the world are often are offering mobile and remote capabilities for access control and workforce management. In brief, customers around the world are looking for new practical and convenient solutions that help promote healthy environments and provide peace of mind. Our leading brands like Schlage, LCN, VON Duprin, interflex and Simons Voss paired with the strength of our supply chain and integration partners are meeting those needs. As we continue to navigate COVID-19 and other challenges, we will focus on our customers, our strategy and the health and safety of our people. Our business has strong fundamentals and has proven the ability to execute. We will continue to monitor, evaluate and adapt to market dynamics. Please go to Slide 7. And I'll walk you through the second quarter financial summary. Revenues for the second quarter were $589.5 million, a decrease of 19.4% or 18.5% organically. The organic revenue decrease was driven by the economic challenges that arose as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, currency headwinds and the impact of divestitures of our businesses in Colombia and Turkey also contributed to the total revenue weakening. All regions experience substantial revenue declines. Patrick will share more detail on the regions at a moment. Adjusted operating margins decreased by 260 basis points in the second quarter. The significant vol e declines drove the margin reduction. We did see positive price, productivity, inflation dynamic, which helped -- which was help by reductions in variable and share based compensation, non-US government incentives, plus the impact of cost actions including reductions in discretionary spending, a freeze on non-essential investments and hiring, restructuring and re-prioritization of capital expenditures. Due to these actions, we saw sequential improvement during the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.92 decreased $0.34 or 27% versus the prior year. The decrease was driven primarily by lowering operating income as a result of reduced revenue. Favorable share count and other income offset some of the operational decline. Year-to-date available cash flow came in at $103.6 million, an increase of approximately $26 million versus the prior year. Improvement in networking capital and reduced capital expenditures more than offset the lower net earnings. Patrick will now walk you through the financial results. And I'll be back later to discuss our 2020 outlook and a wrap-up. Patrick Shannon : Thanks Dave. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. If you would please go to Slide 8. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter 2019 reported earnings per share was a $1.16, adjusting $0.10 for prior year restructuring expenses and integration cost related acquisitions, the 2019 adjusted earnings per share was a $1.26. Operational results decreased earnings per share by $0.42 driven by vol e deleverage that was offset slightly by favorable price and productivity exceeding inflationary impacts and unfavorable currency. The impact of decreased investments in the quarter was a $0.01 increase and an increase in other income drove another positive $0.05 per share impact. Favorable year-over-year share count increased adjusted earnings per share by $0.02. These results in adjusted second quarter 2020 earnings per share of $0.92, a decrease of $0.34 or approximately 27% compared to the prior year. Lastly, we have $0.12 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring costs. After giving effect to these items you arrive at second quarter 2020 reported earnings per share of $0.80. Please go to Slide 9. This slide depicts the components of our revenue performance for the second quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we experienced an 18.5% organic revenue decline in the second quarter. All three regions saw substantial revenue declines. The COVID-19 pandemic drove the decreases across the globe as there were many government mandated shutdowns across all industries where our products are sold. We did see modest price realization which slightly offsets some of the precipitous vol e declines. The impact of the divestiture of our businesses in Colombia and Turkey along with continued currency pressure was headwinds of total growth. Please go to Slide 10. Second quarter revenues for the Americas region were $444.3 million down 18.5% on a reported basis and down 18.1% organically. The decline was driven by vol e challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic; both the non-residential and residential businesses were down significantly. Early in the quarter, our factories in the Baja region of Mexico were shutdown by a broad government decree related to COVID-19 which had a significant impact on shipments. The Americas electronics revenue declined more than 20% in the quarter as that segment was adversely affected due to its discretionary nature. We see electronics continuing to be a long-term growth driver and expect growth to res e when market conditions normalize. On the positive side, the region generated modest price realization and experienced sequential month-over-month improvements in revenue as COVID restrictions began to ease. Through the Mexico plant closures early in the quarter and improving residential markets, we enter the third quarter with a healthy backlog for a residential business. Although the non-residential business orders are below the prior year activity has begun to stabilize.  Americas' adjusted operating income of $124.1 million decreased 23.6% versus the prior year period. And adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 190 basis points. Vol e deleverage drove the decline and was offset slightly by price and productivity exceeding inflation. The region has implemented necessary cost control measures in the quarter including headcount reductions, investment delays and cancellations and reductions in discretionary spending. In addition, manufacturing expenses have been adjusted to reduce impacts on lower volumes. Please go to Slide 11. Second quarter revenues for the EMEA region were $111 million, down 21.9% and down 20.4% on an organic basis. The lower vol e was driven by COVID-19 and the widespread government mandated closures throughout the continent. The impact of the divestiture of the business in Turkey and currency headwinds also contributed to the reported revenue decline and was partially offset by modest price realization. EMEA adjusted operating income of $1.5 million decreased 87% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased by 660 basis points. The margin degradation was driven by the significant vol e declines associated with government mandated closures in several countries where the company operates. Price and productivity exceeding inflation helped mitigate some of the margin decline. Similar to the Americas, reductions in variable compensation and other discretionary spending helped the productivity performance as did assistance received through government incentives. As previously announced in Q1, restructuring programs are underway in the region and we expect benefits to accelerate in the second half of the year. Please go to Slide 12. Second quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $34.2 million, down 22.1% versus the prior year. Organic revenue was down 18%. The decline was driven by COVID-19 related impacts and continued weakness in China residential, in Australian end markets. Total revenue continued to be affected by currency headwinds. Asia-Pacific adjusted operating loss for the quarter was $1.2 million, a decrease of $3 million with adjusted operating margins down 760 basis points versus the prior year period. The operating loss includes a $1.8 million charge related to a specific product quality dispute in China. Significant vol e declines and unfavorable mix also had a large impact on the reduced income and margin. As with the other regions, the price, productivity inflation dynamic was positive and was aided by reductions in variable compensation, other discretionary spending. As with the EMEA, Asia-Pacific also benefited from government incentives related to COVID-19. And as previously announced in Q1, restructuring programs are underway in the region and we expect benefits to accelerate in the second half of the year. Please go to Slide 13. Year-to-date available cash flow for the second quarter came in at $103.6 million which is an increase of approximately $26 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by improvements in networking capital and reduced capital expenditures which more than offset lower adjusted net earnings. Our ability for cash flow generation has been strength of the company that was evident in the second quarter and will continue to serve us well during the current market environment. Looking at the chart to the right, it shows working capital as a percent of revenues decreased based on a 4 point quarter average. This was driven by reduced working capital needs, lower vol e as well as better turnover on accounts receivable. The business continues to generate strong cash flow and we remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital. We will continue to evaluate opportunities, optimize working capital to continue driving substantial cash flow conversion. Our financial and liquidity position remains extremely solid. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio is 1.8 based on the last 12-months performance, we have close to $500 million available under a revolving credit facility. We also remain committed to a flexible and balanced capital allocation strategy. Although, we've communicated a pause in share buybacks in order to focus on liquidity during this time of market volatility, we intend to put excess cash to use as we continue to see market improvement and stabilization. I will now hand it back over to Dave review on our full year 2020 outlook. Dave Petratis : Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide 14. As you know, we previously withdrew our outlook for 2020. This morning we reissued an outlook. The n beers we provided ass e there is no additional COVID-19 impacts including government decrees, supply chain disruptions and safety and health issues. The pandemic has already driven much change in the market dynamic across the world for 2020.  With that said, Allegion's sound fundamental business strength provides some resiliency in times of economic downturn and our long-term investment thesis remains unchanged. In the Americas, we expect to see continued year-over-year organic revenue declines in the second half. Residential markets are expected to rebound more quickly than the non-residential. We have seen sequential increases in home builder demand and point-of-sale metrics have improved in the big box and e-commerce channels. We expect commercial markets to be tough as the pandemic had forced many to work from home. In institutional markets, projects already started will continue and finish. With these expectations, we project organic revenue in the Americas to be down 7.5% to 8.5% for the full year. We're projecting Americas total revenue decline to be 8% to 9% with a slight impact from the divestiture of the business in Colombia. In Europe, markets have softened prior to the COVID-19 outbreak and revenue declines are expected to continue in the second half. However, we are projecting sequential improvement as we go through the back half. For the region, we project our organic growth to be down 9% to 10%. Total revenue includes the impact of currency pressure in the first half, as well as the divestiture of the business in Turkey and is projected to be down 10 % to 11% for the full year. In Asia- Pacific, markets were weak before COVID-19 and we expect that to continue especially in the China residential and Australian markets. With that backdrop, we expect an organic revenue decline in 2020 of 10.5% to 12.5% and total revenue will be down 14% to 16% as currency pressures continue. We are projecting total organic revenues for the company to be down 8% to 9% and total revenues to decline 9% to 10%. Please go to slide 15. Our new 2020 outlook for adjusted earnings per share is $4.15 to $4.30. As indicated, the earnings decline is driven by lower volumes related to COVID-1. We have made significant cost reduction in the business and our work will continue to streamline our structure as needed, while prioritizing critical investments as we remain focused on driving our strategy of seamless access. The combination of interest and other expense is expected to be a positive to earnings per share. Our outlook ass es full adjusted effective tax rates of approximately 13.5% to 14.5%, as well as outstanding weighted average diluted shares of approximately 93 million. The outlook additionally includes approximately $1.35 to $1.45 per share impact from impairment and restructuring charges during the year, most of which has already occurred. As a result, reported EPS is estimated to be at $2.70 to $2.95. Our revised available cash flow outlook for 2020 is now projected to be in the $350 million to $370 million range. Please go to Slide 16. Allegion has strong fundamentals and has proven the ability to execute and adjust to market dynamics as demonstrated during the first half of 2020. We had strong moment in the first quarter particularly in the Americas, while the pandemic was unforeseen and its effects were immediate, we managed the business extremely well to restructure and manage costs. We also move quickly to address new customer needs for touchless solutions and remote management. As we go into the second half of the year, we start from our core strengths in health and safety, supply chain and financial discipline. We will take the necessary and often difficult actions needed to adjust quickly to evolving market dynamics. The strategy of adding value through seamless access in a safer world drives the right focus for the long term. And it puts us on solid footing for the post pandemic world. Thank you. Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Ryan Merkel of William Blair. Please go ahead. RyanMerkel: Thanks and good morning, everyone. So two questions, First off, in Americas the year-over-year decline in electronics was a little more than I thought. Just looking forward do you expect electronics mix to continue to mix down? And then second question are you seeing more interest in touchless access and mobile keys in this environment? DavePetratis: I would say we do not expect a mix down. I think our key growth has been stronger in the residential and I think last mile delivery, the growth of e-commerce, people's connectivity that trend will continue. We've got one of the best locks on the market with our encode lock, the favorability ratings I looked this morning 37,000 comments on Amazon at about a 4.8, so feel extremely good about that. I think the weakness in the quarter really driven by the overall lockdowns but in terms of integrators ability to enter college campuses, none of us wanted people coming on site and that work to see, so we like the long-term trends and I believe it's a key factor going forward. I think two, when you think about some of the capabilities that we're putting together, the ability to seamlessly travel without touch whether there's the wave at hand, your edge device, these things will continue to be drivers. Add things like our investment in the need to be able to understand how many people are in a room, in an area, in a building; these are things that will continue to expand as we go forward. Operator : The next question comes from John Walsh of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. JohnWalsh: Hi, good morning. I wondered if we could just touch a little bit on investments and tax I guess maybe first on the investments, obviously, you put a hard number around it not surprising it's lower than the initial expectations given the way demands played out, tax this is kind of the second year in a row. We'll have this lower rate, how should we think about the investment spending going forward in the sustainability of the tax rate from here? PatrickShannon: So as we indicated in our full year guide, we're looking at some incremental investments although it's lower than what we'd originally anticipated, but nonetheless higher than last year. And that's predominantly around this whole movement in electronics and trying to drive that market for faster adoption. Some specific initiatives around the IoT platform and those types of things that will help us, in particular as we begin to kind of come out of this pandemic. So feel good about those investments and the ability to be able to drive incremental revenue and as we've indicated historically those investments have enabled us to drive revenue faster than the overall market. And I think we get good return on those in terms of invested capital. So going forward will kind of continue to monitor the markets and the needs in our business, and we'll continue to invest for the long-term future in our business. As it relates to the tax rate, we are anticipating a lower rate again than what was originally provided at the beginning of the year. Some of that is due to some favorable items that kind of came through FIN48 reserves those type of things. Some of it is quite frankly we've been able to implement some new tax planning strategies that will take effect and feel good about the work that the team is implemented there. As we go forward beyond 2020, we had historically given some guidance that the tax rate would migrate upwards to kind of like the high teens area, more guidance to come when we come out with the 2021 information, but I feel fairly confident it will be better than that maybe mid-teens type of thing at least in the near term and that's all because of where we find ourselves today and some of the great tax planning strategy work that's been going on. JohnWalsh: Great. Thank you for that color. And then maybe just a follow-up here. You talked about in the Americas exiting with some strength and resi and stabilization and non-resi. Can you put any numbers around that either what the exit rate was in June or what you're seeing here in July? DavePetratis: So, first, I'd go to the backlogs, we've got effectively record backlogs between commercial institutional and res, the res demand extremely strong as we look at point of sale. If you look May, June and July the 12% increase in dollars, 7% in units really like that trend this morning's Wall Street Journal about strength in housing I think the other thing as you think about our res performance especially in the first half, there was a mandate in the country of Mexico to shutdown that's about 25% of our workforce and a big supplier of our res supply chain. We deleted inventories in a situation where demand was accelerating that point of sale that I referred to. Record backlogs in residential I think we've got a great set of product capabilities and I think our supply chain is stronger than the people that we're competing against. So I like our opportunities as we go through the next -- the second half and early in the next year. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please go ahead. JeffSprague: Thank you. Good morning. Two from me also, David, I'd be interested in just your kind of forward opinion here now on the non-res cycle overall. You introduced on the Q1 call the very logical possibility that 2021 could be down given the later cycle nature for some of these end markets. Based on what you're seeing in the channels now and just pipeline work and other folks on the ground what's your thought around that large question on everyone's mind? DavePetratis: So I think when you think about the institution of commercial verticals, everybody caution, right. I think clearly there's shifts going on there I think we saw the ABI come out it, doesn't drive optimism I think as I look at Allegion healthy backlogs, our commercial institutional backlogs as we exited June high but I think the other thing that we look at specs written, we saw some disruption and spec writing and demand from architectural firms that's to be expected. I think we'll have a better call on specs written which is an early demand level as we exit Q3. If I looked at spec written today it's improved every week as we've gone through the crisis, but this is more of a long-term trend but as I would look at educational, healthcare, total commercial we anticipate softer markets. We will put our foot on to drive seamless access and we believe we can outperform in a weaker position because of our installed base. The strength of our spec writing and the capability of the Allegion. JeffSprague: Thanks and then second question perhaps for Patrick, just around kind of the cost reduction actions Patrick can you just provide a little bit more granularity on kind of what's kind of been done structurally from a cost-saving standpoint and what perhaps is temporary and I'm sure you like a lot of companies also some of these temporary actions are feeling like maybe they're at least semi-permanent as folks think about travel budgets and the like. But if you could kind of frame that up for us it would be helpful. PatrickShannon: Yes. sure. So good question. Let me try to provide a framework around that. First of all, we've identified and we are executing on a plan of about $80 million of cost reduction year-over-year reduction. And I would bucket that into three categories. The first of which would be the structural, more fixed cost predominantly headcount reduction that for this year is about 30% of the $80 million. Then you've got another bucket what I call the discretionary type of expenditures i.e. T&E, contractor spent, consulting those type of things, the things that you control in a down market, that's another probably 30% of the $80 million for this year and then the variable type of items, the things that are compensation related that a large portion of which will probably boomerang back next year is the balance of the $80 million or 40% of the total that I think the key point here is that offsetting the variable stuff i.e. the things that are expected to come back next year. We do have and we'll have carryforward benefit associated with some of the permanent cost reductions that will carry into next year. We won't be in a full year run rate level on some of those identified costs until Q4. So we have that as Dave mentioned in a script we will continue to work on further cost reductions to help mitigate that as well. So TBD onfurther actions that will be identified for the second half of the year. DavePetratis: I'd just add a little color as well. I think we got after this early even before Covid-19 you could see that in our in-flight restructuring plans and I think it's important that we continue to accelerate investments around electronics and seamless access, while transforming the company into a leaner structure. Operator : The next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Please go ahead. ColtonWest: HI. Good morning. It's Colton West on for David MacGregor. I guess you pointed out sequential improvement on a month-to-month basis in the Americas in the quarter. Are you seeing those trends continue into July now? DavePetratis: Absolutely. As you can feel the pulse of the economy coming back and I put cautions around that because in some cases they've gone too fast, but we feel it I think if you're in the wholesale retail channel on shelf inventories are down and we're seeing that in terms of specs quotes, point of sale and our own shipment. ColtonWest: Okay and then I guess as follow-up non-res came in better than res, sounds like for the quarter. How much of that was volumes versus price mix? If I recall correctly you guys implemented 3% pricing on commercial hardware back in April? PatrickShannon: Yes, majority volume related but as we kind of saw in Q1 pricing relative to non-res better than the residential performance. We will continue to push that dynamic to the extent we can and so far here year-to-date have been fairly successful in getting solid price realization in the non-residential segment. Operator : Next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. JoeRitchie: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, Dave, my first question maybe just trying to unpack the impact that you had from the Mexico decree. I know last quarter you guys had talked about having inventory on hand, but it sounds like you kind of depleted that inventory fairly quickly as the quarter went out. I'm just trying to understand, one, kind of like the impact that you had in the first quarter from maybe running out of inventory. And then secondly like how we should be potentially thinking about a restock as you get back online in Mexico. DavePetratis: So we deep dive this in terms of the performance second quarter, there was a decree from Mexico that mandated a 30-day shutdown. We were open well ahead of that and it was our ability to point out that we were essential, but more importantly our ability to keep our people safe. If you dig into it the governor of the Baja highlighted Allegion in a press conference in our safe practices and the confidence that we could do that, so that was important. I think if you look at the whole region we got restarted quicker. Second, the government mandated that anybody over the age of 55 immune compromised, pregnant could not work for us that was about 300 to 400 employees. We had this and some of our most experienced, we have reloaded on that and are producing at a higher -- we're producing out of the Baja today at the highest level since I've been at Allegion or we created the company. So if you think about that we've got 42 discrete manufacturing lines in Enemata if you have ever visited, there the ability to bring on that number of employees, pull that lever and replenish the supply chain is, and I think, few companies in the world could do it. So extremely proud the team, our ability to reinvent. I think a second thing that important here, you don't see the point of sale data but our teams did an extremely good job to drive our -- se our inventory to keep customers and products, as well as other partners in the supply chain. When you think about a situation where you're trying to maximize inventory, we reached out into our partners supply chains to be able to optimize that. Again, I thought they did a better job of it. And I believe the last point your question, we will be well into the first quarter of next year getting the supply chain in terms of finished inventories normalized with the increasing demand. JoeRitchie: Got it. Okay. That's helpful color, Dave. I guess my one follow-up question here in just thinking about what's happening from a commodity perspective and how your business mix is perhaps expected to change over the next four months, your copper prices right now are surging and notice that while pricing was still positive this quarter I think it's 70 bps from the Americas, it was still you saw a tick down versus Q1. So I'm just trying to understand I guess as we kind of move forward in this environment where volumes really aren't at normal levels like how are you guys feeling about your ability to offset inflation and your ability to get price in this environment. Also in the context of kind of the mixed shift that you're seeing in your business. DavePetratis: I'm always confident on price. I would say the market is discipline. Our first cautionary is always steel. We purchase a lot of steel more and then I think brass, but we're continue -- we'll continue to be aggressive on price realization, try to offset the effects of inflation, but I'm net positive and I'm that way every day. Patrick will bring some realization to it. PatrickShannon: Well, Joe, you're right. I mean the commodity prices have continued rise here over the last 90 days or so. I'd say for the balance of the year is you kind of look at the margin profile, think about sequential improvement as we progress throughout the course of the year, just through more efficiency and some of the cost measures we're taking will help us navigate for the balance of the year. Next year, another question will kind of monitor and see how progresses during the course of this year, but as Dave mentioned we will continue to push price to the extent we can and if we're unable to offset the inflationary impact will drive productivity, we'll make the appropriate investments to do whatever we can to mitigate the inflationary impact. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Please go ahead. AndrewObin: Hi, guys. Good morning. Question, can you just comment on regional trends in the US? How is California trending versus Texas versus Florida versus Northeast? I mean frankly just trying to figure out how COVID and the second wave is just impact has been impacting demand, and if there is close correlation between what we see with hospitalizations and demand trends by region? Thank you. DavePetratis: I would say the stoppage in New York, the Northeast, you have some pretty strong governor mandates and decrees especially Boston, no public construction. We do very well in those big metro markets and so we're seeing that recovery as North East gets better. Again, you look to California, the construction and Allegion was able to operate during the first shutdown. We'll see how it drives if as they move, I guess, towards a second shutdown. I think you really dig in the data the COVID, Andrew, you're seeing growing pockets in construction workers of infection and how government will mandate around it. We've got to keep an eye on it, but construction has been considered essential in most areas of the country. And I think it will continue. AndrewObin: And then just a follow up just sort of talked about seamless access, but how do you think how you rethinking access business post COVID? Do you expect any structural changes and what the customers will demand in terms of being able to sort of get an out of the building without touching things? DavePetratis: So I absolutely believe it, the number of enquiries on our antimicrobial products would be a clear example, but Andrew, I really believe that your edge device is how we'll navigate through society. The long-term trend I think positive. We've got the ability exist today to be able to through your edge device monitor your temperature as you approach the door, if you're out of it accepted range, are you going to get a temperature check, do we allow access. Those are things that are going to continue to develop as a result of Covid-19 and trying to keep people healthy. Operator : The next question comes from Tim Wojs of Baird. Please go ahead. TimWojs: Hey, guys. Good morning. Just maybe going back to Americas and just some of the cadence through the quarter, is there any way to just think about how June kind of finished up relative to the quarter in both resi and non-resi? PatrickShannon: Yes, Tim, I would say again during the course of the quarter sequential improvement is a quarter progressed, June much stronger than May, May stronger than April, feel pretty good relative to the visibility and the strengths relative to the backlog and the order intake. Resi, as Dave indicated POS really strong demand improving significantly on non-resi, I'd say it's more stabilized kind of going into Q2 and exiting out of Q2 now much better and so relative commensurate was kind of the guidance we gave that's kind of how we're seeing things right now, maybe a little conservatism there but okay. DavePetratis: I'd also say we look at a variety of indicators on non-resi bookings, frame sales, hardware quotes, specs written, wholesale sell-through, every week as we exited April got better. You could see things coming back through. TimWojs: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then I guess bigger picture if the end markets maybe over the next 12 to 18 months are choppy. I'm just wanted to gauge your appetite on just M&A and I guess your appetite change at all? I mean is just a time where maybe you'd purposely get more aggressive to just add good assets and maybe a time of more stress. DavePetratis: We'll certainly be watching the stress movements on a set of selected assets that we always keep an eye on. I don't expect a lot of change in those things that we would aspire to; the jewels that could help redefine Allegion. I don't expect that to change, but look for us to increase our activity around tools that will help us expand seamless access, both internally and externally. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. JoshPokrzywinski: Hey. Good morning, guys. Just before my question, Dave, thanks for your leadership on employee, safety, health, societal awareness all that. I think it's very clear those aren't just talking points, so really appreciate that. Just a couple questions on the non-resi business. First on backlog visibility, how far does that stretch out, does that get you through your end? As I get into 2021 and then any comments that you would make on some of the retrofit side of the business versus new as you see activity or quotes in the market today because I think maybe relative to some other products that's out there security retrofit is either completely non-discretionary because you're locked out or it's broken or a lot more discretionary around aesthetics or upgrades. So just maybe some comments on how that retrofit side looks. Thanks. DavePetratis: I'd say in terms of the backlog in commercial, institutional. I'd say you look at that with a six month lens but there are a couple filters. What we have in the actual backlog then you start looking at quote specs, job awards like let's just take a -- if we look at the city of Washington DC, job awards that could go out 18-24 months do we have the contractor, the architect, the wholesaler? There are things that go beyond just our book of business and generally we're going to get more than our fair share there. So I think good indicators but then you got to go to the broader macro. So I feel pretty good sitting here. I feel very good on 2020, it's as you look at I put those caution lines. Second question on the discretionary. I would -- I believe in terms of break fix, the discretionary side of the market especially the day that money gets spent especially with rising crime rates. I live in the downtown areas of Indianapolis; you're going to get your doors locked. And I think you also got to think about shutdowns. Our place is secure, so the discretionary break part of this market tends to roll it up and down economies and generally if you've got LCN, VON Duprin, interflex installed you're going like-for-like. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Kessler of Imperial Capital. Please go ahead. JeffreyKessler: Thank you. In terms of timing on the regions it seems that in the US and particularly the southern -- in the southern tier is going to ask -- is going to continue to have some problems although the Northeast is obviously done a lot better. Europe seems to have rolled over its COVID problems much more quickly than we have. Are you seeing any impact on your business in Europe because of perhaps there -- them coming out of pandemic a little bit earlier than the US? DavePetratis: We see -- let me say this. We've got our electronics, our Simons Voss and VON Duprin and interflex, that are mechanical business in Europe, the electronic business has performed well during the COVID-19 in lockdowns and it's -- you got to look at that as a key strength maybe better geographical position, but it's that continued trend of electronic conversion, software capabilities that is leading the way there. So we like that. We're going to continue to invest in that and we were driving some restructuring before COVID-19 was either mentioned. The world has got a challenge in terms of overall GDP, but we -- the dark regions, the Nordic regions are going to be a bit better than the southern and the electronic trends, we think will continue to operate nicely anywhere we're at in the world. JeffreyKessler: Follow-up is you've talked a good amount of seamless and touchless of electronics. Are you seeing any move within the sub sectors and when you got some Bluetooth connectivity, but obviously NFC has been on the tip of your tongue now for since you guys were before the company was even spun out of and now that Apple has brought into NFC wholly at this point. The entire NFC world seems to be growing. The question is looking at other companies some smaller companies who are moving very quickly into NFC access, are you seeing the same type of -- are you seeing more competition area? Are you seeing your own business of improving in that area? And if so, what are the areas that you're going to be focusing on with regard to some of these new -- some of these technologies have been around but have been suppressed for one reason or another. DavePetratis: So I look back --I look backward to try and understand what our strength is. I think in the 18 or last 22 quarters, we have grown double digits in electronics, so we like that trend. Two is I think it's all about your edge device and that is the tool that will allow the free flow of people. I think the problems to be solved are outstanding. Remember, we were the first company in the world, hey, open the door. Our relationships with Apple are outstanding. And I think these technologies are going to continue to drive and shape the marketplace and I like the position of Allegion. Operator : The next question comes from Deepa Raghavan of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. DeepaRaghavan: Hi. Good morning. Question for me is for Americas fiscal year 2020 revenues, it doesn't look like the revenue outlook assumes Q4 exits with positive growth, but it definitely looks like you're planning for continued sequential improvement throughout the second half. Now if we continue to extrapolate that trend, it appears spring could be the likely bottom. I mean and by next construction season we could be talking positive non-res in Americas. Now is that a reasonable way to think about trends if economy stabilizes here or is the air pocket and quotation activities that you're currently seeing push the time-life -- timeline out materially? DavePetratis: Great question, not easy answers. I went back and looked at contraction in the architectural indexes and these tend to snap back quickly. Now is this the pandemic will follow that? I think it's a function of how long the pandemic drags on, the real damage that's been done to institutional budgets, but as we move in to the construction season there is naturally an improvement and spring could be given us life here, but I think we'll have a better view of that 90 -days. DeepaRaghavan: Got it. Can you talk about inventory in the system and if you can split that between resi and non-residential inventory commentary that will be helpful? Thank you very much. DavePetratis: Inventory and the residential channel have been depleted. I'm looking for some numbers here but think about it 16 days of no replenishment, we tend to try and optimize those inventories so the shelves aren't bare, we're in a replenishment cycle, but it will take well in the first quarter at the significant demand levels to get that back to normal. If there's any weakness in competitive supply chain, and if you think about some of our competitors the supply chains get pretty complex, we could have more opportunity and could take longer. We'll take on that challenge. In terms of the non-res commercial institutional supply chains, those are responding back quickly, I think, some of the leverage that we had was we built backlog and some of our institutional products. We're able to fill that but that's normalizing much quicker. Operator : Our last question from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead. JulianMitchell: Hi. Good morning. Maybe just the first question around circling back to residential just trying to understand when you put everything together around the Mexico impact and inventories and so forth. And the point-of-sale data, how likely is it you think that the residential revenues in the Americas can grow in the second half? It's certainly something that we're seeing at other resi related products. And any color you could give on the differing outlooks you have within resi of new construction versus the replacement site. PatrickShannon: I would characterize it this way, Julian, as we look at the residential business and you kind of look at all the factors you mentioned. Clearly, the second half sequential improvement as we progress throughout the year. Growth is year-over-year will be dependent upon our ability to get the labor in place to produce the product and get it through the channel to the end customer. And so a little bit constrained there from a capacity perspective is kind of going to be the driver whether we can show year-over-year growth, but nonetheless we'll kind of continue to drive that like the overall trend in electronics that's going to rebound as well to provide some additional growth as well. DavePetratis: So I'd be maybe a little bit more aggressive in that. I believe Allegion has a better supply chain than our competitor. And I believe that is going to allow us to take some advantages here in the marketplace. And you think about that. These products come from South East Asia, the complexity can get pretty hard, where our tends to be is more North American centric even though we had to take a pause to keep our people healthy. I think I've got a better supply chain. I'd say second, the point-of-sale orders are reflecting that we're creating opportunities. Our electronics are some of the highest regarded and highest quality in the marketplace. And then some of the builder activity that part of the market is growing today in The Wall Street Journal. And if you've got a question, are my suppliers going to be able to support me as that market expands, if you're any of the big builders who you're going to look to. And I like our opportunities to have the discussions when you've got to depend on products coming halfway around the world to support your home building effort in an environment of uncertainty this pandemic. I like our opportunities. JulianMitchell: Thank you. And any color on replacement trends in particular. I think as you said new home building very strong using replacements perhaps growing at an equal pace in the second half or similar revenue trajectory as OE? DavePetratis: Amazing as I work from home, the amount of activity in the do-it-yourself centers then think about more frequent deliveries of point-of- sale. And then people just investing back in your home, Schlage is the number one replacement brand. It's a nice spot of the market. So I like our opportunity.

Tom Martineau : Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for Allegion's third quarter 2020 earnings call. With me today are Dave Petratis, Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and the presentation which we will refer to in today's call are available on our website at investor.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website. Please go to slide number two and three. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our most recent SEC filings for description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Today's presentation and commentary include non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details. Dave and Patrick will now discuss our third quarter 2020 results, which will be followed by a Q&A session. Please for the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and one short follow-up and then re-enter the queue. We will like to give everyone an opportunity given the time allotted. Please go to slide four and I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave Petratis : Thanks, Tom. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'll start by walking through the third quarter financial summary. Revenue for the third quarter was $728.4 million, a decrease of 2.7% or 3.4% organically, which shows sequential improvement from Q2 to Q3. The organic revenue decrease was driven by continued economic challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Currency tailwinds provided a boost to total revenue and more than offset the impact of divestitures of our business in Colombia and Turkey. Patrick will share more detail on the regions in a moment. Adjusted operating margin increased by 20 basis points in the third quarter. I'm extremely proud of the resiliency shown by the Allegion team. We executed extremely well and the cost management actions taken during the year helped mitigate the deleverage from volume declines. Positive price and muted inflation also helped deliver the operating margin increase. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.67 increased $0.20 or approximately 14% versus the prior year. The increase was driven primarily by favorable other income, tax cite rate and share count offset the lower operating income. Year-to-date available cash flow came in at $256.1 million, an increase of just over $26 million versus the prior year. Improvement in networking capital and reduce capital expenditures more than offset the lower net earnings. Please go to slide five. Access has been part of our company's heritage for more than a 100 years, and our vision of seamless access and a safer world are providing a sound foundation for our future. In the realities of a post COVID world, customers have new concerns and new needs for healthy environments. The importance of making home, work and institutions safer has never been so important to our customers and the needs for touchless access is not going away. Our business is disciplined and focused, prioritizing investments in our seamless access strategy. As a result, Allegion continues to deliver leadership and innovation across the portfolio. Our Schlage brand is 100 year old powerhouse that spans the globe. In the building channel, our mix of Schlage mechanical and electronic solutions continue to help us win projects, including the new development community in Florida with over 3000 homes. Allegion is further advancing seamless access for builders with electronic solutions that provide contactless home showings, and the Schlage Encode Smart Deadbolt continues to gain momentum in both residential, new construction and retail markets. On university campuses, among the first schools to adopt Schlage security solutions for Apple Wallet are the University of Tennessee, University of Vermont and the University of San Francisco. Allegion now supports contactless student IDs across Apple Wallet, Android and Google Pay. For commercial and institutional markets, we have a full suite of mobile-enabled Schlage locks and readers. In a post-COVID environment mobile technology, contactless hardware and readers in combination with wave-to-open actuators now extend our touchless options for interior and perimeter security. Seamless access also getting grabbed outside the Americas in Q3. SimonsVoss is celebrating its 25th year as an electronic access innovator, and was recently recognized in Germany as the number one electronic locking system manufacturer. In Australia, we just delivered the Gainsborough Freestyle Electronic Trilock for single family and short term rentals, giving the owner full control of access from a mobile approximately. And in Australia and in New Zealand, we introduced the Schlage Omnia fire-rated smart lock for multi-family and office settings. In the quarter we booked over 4 million in orders to support and provide seamless access touchless [ph] solutions to a global leader in social media to be delivered in \u201821. Our investments in seamless access are bolstered by global accelerators. Allegion's partner of choice and open credential strategy is an important accelerator. More than 45 physical access control software providers already integrate with Schlage electronic locks and devices. Many of them are moving to integrate to our mobile credential ecosystem as well. Our global accelerators include e-commerce, touchless access, and increased focus on visitor management and occupancy monitoring. Seamless access is providing to be a strong foundation for our future. Patrick, will now talk to you - walk you through the financial results. And I'll be back to later discuss our 2020 outlook and wrap up. Patrick Shannon : Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. And please go to slide number six. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2019 reported earnings per share was $1.40. Adjusting $0.07 for the prior year restructuring expenses, integration cost related acquisitions and debt refinancing costs, the 2019 adjusted earnings per share was $1.47. Favorable other income and interest expense increased earnings per share by $0.15. The increase was driven by an approximately $14 million non-cash currency translation gain related to the liquidation of a legal entity in our EMEA region. This benefit would not be expected to recur in 2021. Favorable year-over-year tax rate and share count combined to provide another positive $0.08 per share impact. Operational results decreased earnings per share by $0.03, driven by volume deleverage that was nearly offset by favorable price and productivity exceeding inflationary impacts, as well as favorable currency. This results in adjusted third quarter 2020 earnings per share of $1.67, an increase of $0.20 or approximately 14% compared to the prior year. Lastly, we have a $0.09 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring and impairment costs. After giving effect to these items you arrive at the third quarter 2020 reported earnings per share of $1.58. Please go to slide number seven. This slide depicts the components of our revenue performance for the third quarter, I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we experienced a 3.4% organic revenue decline in the third quarter. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to have an impact on the top line number, although we did realize the benefit of delayed projects from the prior quarter. As shown in the trending chart, revenues rebounded nicely, but were short of the very strong quarterly results in the prior year. Despite the difficult and uncertain times we are operating in, the overall business performed very well, particularly in the supply chain and meeting customer requirements. It is also important to note that price remained solid in the quarter, which slightly offset the volume pressure. Currency also provided a tailwind to total growth, and more than offset the impact of the divestiture of our businesses in Colombia and Turkey. Please go to slide number eight. Third quarter revenues for the Americas region were $539.1 million, down 5.1% on a reported basis and down 4.6% organically. The decline was driven by volume challenges on the non-residential business due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was partially offset by good price realization and strength in the residential business. The non-residential business was down low double digits. Conversely, residential bounced back nicely and grew at a low double digit rate. The Americas electronics revenue declined in the mid single digit range, as discretionary commercial projects are delayed. We see electronics and touchless solutions continuing to be a long-term growth drivers and expect electronics accelerated growth to resume when market conditions normalize. America's adjusted operating income of $166.6 million decreased 5.1% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter was flat. Discretionary cost actions, restructuring benefits and material deflation mitigated the impacts of volume deleverage and unfavorable mix. Please go to slide number nine. Third quarter revenues for the EMEA region were $148.4 million up 7.7% and up 2.9% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by strength in a Global Portable Security and SimonsVoss businesses, as well as solid price realization. Favorable currency impacts contributed to total revenue growth and was slightly offset by the impact of the divestiture in the business in Turkey. EMEA adjusted operating income of $17.1 million increased 42.5% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased by 280 basis points. The margin increase was driven primarily by price and productivity exceeding inflation. Productivity was bolstered by benefits from lower operating costs from the restructuring actions taken earlier in the year and discretionary and variable cost reductions. Please go to slide number 10. Third quarter revenues for Asia Pacific region were $40.9 million down 4.2% versus the prior year, with an organic revenue decline of 6.8%. The decline was driven by continued COVID-19 related impacts and weakness in Korea. Our Australia business performed quite well despite the ongoing pressure in Australian end markets. Currency tailwinds offset some of the organic revenue decline. Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $3.2 million, a decrease of $1.2 million with adjusted operating margins down 250 basis points versus the prior year period. Of note, the prior year operating income includes a $1.1 million favorable one-time item related to the recovery of previously remitted non-income taxes. This had a 260 basis point favorable impact on Asia Pacific margins in Q3 of 2019. Excluding that, margins were essentially flat year-over-year, with the volume deleverage and unfavorable mix being offset by favorable price and productivity exceeding inflation. Please go to slide number 11. Year-to-date available cash flow for the third quarter 2020 came in at $256.1 million, which is an increase of just over $26 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by improvements in net working capital and reduced capital expenditures, which more than offset lower net earnings. Our strong cash flow generation has been an asset to the company. This was evident in the third quarter and will continue to serve us well during the current market environment. Looking at the chart to the right, it shows working capital as a percentage of revenues decreased based on a 4 point quarter average. This was driven by reduced working capital needs from the lower volume, as well as strong collections performance. The business continues to generate strong cash flow and we remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize working capital and drive effective cash flow conversion. Please go to slide number 12. Our financial and liquidity position remains extremely solid. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio is 1.6, based on the last 12 months performance. Our debt covenants are well within the required limits. And we have no near term debt maturities. Our $500 million credit facility remains untapped. Our quarterly dividend in 2020 increased 18.5% through the third quarter. This is the sixth consecutive year of annual increases. In addition, with a strong operational execution and cash generation, the increased cash position since the beginning of the year, and better visibility into business conditions, we have resumed share repurchases under our previously authorized $800 million program. As you have heard us say numerous times, we've put our excess cash to use as part of our commitment to a flexible and balanced capital allocation strategy. I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2020 outlook. Dave Petratis : Thank you, Patrick. Please go to slide number 13. As you know, we were one of the handful of companies who provided an outlook following Q2. With another quarter being behind us, and a bit more clarity, we are updating our outlook for 2020. In the Americas, we expect to see continued pressure on the non-residential business, as discretionary spending and commercial markets remain tough due to the people continuing to work from home. In institutional markets, the projects are restarted will continue to finish. The rate of completion may be slowed as restrictions for the number of people on job sites remain in place, and supply chain issues to the construction site. Residential markets are expected to remain strong in all channels we serve, Big Box retail, e-commerce and new construction. With these expectations, we are improving the organic revenue outlook in the Americas to be down 5.5% to 6% for the full year. We are projecting America's total revenue decline to be 6% to 6.5%, with a slight impact from the divestiture of the business in Colombia. In Europe, we saw sequential improvement in Q3 and we expect Q4 to be better than the year-to-date performance we have experienced. For the region, we now project organic revenue to be down 6.5% to 7.5%. Total Revenue includes currency tailwinds in the latter part of the year, as well as the impacts from the divestiture of the businesses in Turkey and is projected to be down 4.5% to 5.5% for the full year. In Asia Pacific markets were weak before COVID-19, especially in Australia. We expect that along with the weakness we are experiencing Korea to continue. With this backdrop, we expect 2020 organic revenue decline of 12% to 13%. In 2020, total revenue to be down 12.5% to 13.5%, with a slight impact from currency. We are projecting total and organic revenue for the company to be down 6% to 6.5%. We are raising our outlook for adjusted earnings per share to a range of $4.75 to $4.80. Although net investments are assumed to be relatively small in the revised outlook, we remain committed to investing in innovation that supports our seamless access strategy. This outlook reflects the reprioritization of investment to support the expected future of electronics growth. Our revised outlook assumes a full year adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 13%, as well as outstanding weighted average diluted shares of approximately 93 million. The outlook additionally includes approximately $1.30 to $1.35 per share impact from impairment and restructuring charge during the year, most of which have already occurred. As a result, reported EPS is estimated at $3.40 to $3.50. Finally, our revised available cash flow outlook for 2020 has increased and is now projected to be in the $400 million to $420 million range. Please go to slide 14. Allegion has strong business fundamentals and a proven ability to execute and adapt to a changing and uncertain market conditions. We have managed the business extremely well to mitigate the impacts of the ongoing pandemic. We remain ready to serve our customers and meet their needs for touchless access and healthy environments with our market leading brands. We will provide an official outlook for 2021 during our Q4 full year call early next year. But as we think about the remainder of the year, and begin to look at 2021, some key observations that we see are, as previously expected, commercial and institutional markets will continue to be soft in Q4 and in the first half of 2021, with a snapback in repair, retrofit and small projects beginning in the second half of next year. US state and local bond issues continue to be - moved ahead and supported by local communities. Residential end markets are expected to remain strong for the long term, as an under supply of single family homes is corrected. We will continue to manage our cost base to help aggressively mitigate any volume reductions. Seamless access software and electronics will drive growth and continue to be among our top investment priorities, they are our future. Strong cash flow generation will remain a focus with capital deployment to enhance shareholder returns. Going forward, Allegion will be leaner and more focused as we navigate the coming months and emerge from the pandemic. We have implemented restructuring actions during the year that have addressed the cost base in order to right-size the business. We will continue to evaluate business going forward and make necessary changes. Our execution and commitment to driving solid results will remain high. In closing, Allegion\u2019s future is bright. We thank you. And we'll now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Chris Snyder of UBS. Please go ahead. Chris Snyder : Thank you for the question. Could you, you know, just maybe unpack the Q4 guidance a little bit? Just I guess specifically as it relates to the resi and the non-resi piece in the Americas? Dave Petratis : So we don't provide specific guidance by quarter, you can obviously back into that relative to our full year guide. I would say, you know, basis of our Q3 performance, strong, both in terms of top line and operating income margin performance, you know, relative to the backdrop of what's going on around the globe. I would say you can kind of see similar type of patterns, in terms of both the non-residential and residential businesses and in terms of what you saw in Q3. But, you know, we'll continue to manage the costs to help mitigate any shortfall relative to the non-residential business and the margin impact. We do have a mix impact that's going on here relative to growth in residential, and, softness in non-residential business. Chris Snyder : Appreciate that. And then maybe just following up on the resi piece, and I certainly understand your comments on, you know, the resi new construction cycle picking up and we've had low household formations for a long time now. So certainly, you know, see that view. But I guess specifically as it relates to, maybe the restocking cycle, I know there was the Q2 supply chain disruption, like, you know, has that restocking stuff cycle fully been realized at this point? Maybe what's kind of like the runway there that you see growth just on that end? Dave Petratis : I would say, as we look at the res segment and the pause that, you know, was taken by all suppliers in Q2. We're at record backlogs and normalizing that will take certainly into early Q2. Chris Snyder : Thank you for that color. Very much appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Ryan Merkel of William Blair. Please go ahead. Ryan Merkel : Hey, thanks. Good morning and nice quarter. Dave Petratis : Thank you. Ryan Merkel : So first off, America's electronics revenue down mid single digits is much improved. You gave some remarks that the trend of touchless access is real and happening. Do you expect this business to turn positive in the fourth quarter? And could electronics provide some offset to weaker underlying commercial trends in 2021 or is that a bit of a reach at this point? Dave Petratis : Electronics will be positive in Q4. As you look at the year, our electronics, especially electronics mirrors our res and commercial performance, extremely strong and electronics res extremely strong, somewhat muted in commercial and institutional. Two reasons for that. The strength in residential electronics is driven by supply chain strength and an extremely strong position in the portfolio of our products. The Schlage Encode, the Schlage Connect, our KPL locks are some of the best products on the market. So where was the growth in the quarter? In Q3, we had a supplier affected by COVID. And we lost a couple weeks with that. The demand did not stop it, it affected our ability. And if you normalize that through the balance of the year, our growth in electronics, you know, led by res continues. So you know, feel good about that. Ryan Merkel : That's super helpful. Thanks for that. And then I want to follow up on the 4Q guide and maybe ask it a little differently. It seems to imply America's you know, revenue down mid single digits year-over-year, with flattish margins, just like this quarter. So if I have that, right, why is there not more improvement in the Americas business in 4Q? Dave Petratis : So, you know, I would characterize it this way, entering into Q3, we had stronger backlogs, particularly in the non-residential business, some of the projects were delayed in the catch-up and that type of thing. And so we were able to maybe operate more efficiently from a manufacturing perspective that helped the margin profile and the business. Two would be, in Q4 maybe a stronger negative mix component, relative to the residential, non-residential sales in the quarter, as well as within the channel and product segments within the non-residential business. So there is a lot of things going on there. But quite frankly, we will, as I said earlier, continue to manage the margin. Well, I was very happy with the progress we made relative to some of the mitigation on the cost side. And you saw that with strong overall margin improvement relative to the prior year. Ryan Merkel : Yeah. Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning, guys. Dave Petratis : Good morning, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Dave, just coming back first to some of your comments on the channel replenishment that's necessary in res and appreciate that kind of side point on the - on maybe some of the interruptions on the electronic side that kept fulfillment, you know, maybe cap there. Would you mind quantifying how big of a replenishment still needs to happen? If I remember your comments last time, it was kind of through 1Q. Now it sounds like early 2Q. So maybe a bit of a push out there. But how many weeks of inventory or points of demand, however you want to put it, does the channel need to kind of get back to normal levels on the res side? Dave Petratis : So, Josh, you know, I would - you know, sorted out in my mind is we leave Q3 with record residential backlog, number one. As I think about bringing that backlog down to normal, it pushes us into Q2. It's not inhibited by our ability for throughput, you know, just with the small disruption. We have had - we have expanded capacity of our residential capability significantly. Demand is good. We've done a good job picking up builders, expanding space at big box. E-commerce remains extremely red hot, and I believe it's our ability to keep our customers in product that has built that backlog. I would say gaining share and a strong suite of electronics that has enhanced our position. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it\u2026 Dave Petratis : I'd add one other comment. I'd add one other comment, Allegion\u2019s ability to flex that supply chain is impressive, as is impressive of anything that I've seen in my 40 years of manufacturing. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Appreciate that color. And then just a follow up. Dave, I appreciate that you even going back to April that you've been cognizant that the current environment probably doesn't support an awesome 2021 for non-res, I think that's now much more apparent to a broader range of folks. If I kind of take some of your comments as a time series, you know, starting from the first quarter earnings, it doesn't really sound like much has changed in the outlook, as you guys have seen more data come through and have gotten closer to next year, if anything, if some of the bond issuance commentary sounds a bit more supportive than what we would have known back then. Is that reading it, right? I mean, I guess, you know, how do you feel versus some of those early observations when we were in the first half of the year, and this is all still fresh? Dave Petratis : So barring a rupture, I believe, you know, we're lifting off the bottom. I was extremely encouraged by the ABI lift from 40 to 47. Our spec levels are just slightly lighter than last year. So I think that's a net positive. But I've also got to be cognizant, in our key markets, commercial, institutional, especially institutional, the priority is around keeping people safe, keeping people socially distanced, keeping people capacities properly managed. So in my mind, they're small projects, break fix, preventive maintenance that gets delayed, and I believe as COVID winds down in Q2, we're going to see a snapback in those types of projects. And, you know, things will move back towards normal as we get to \u201822. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Great color. Thanks, Dave. Operator : The next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Dave Petratis : Good morning. Joe Ritchie : Hey, Dave, just to you know, I hate to harp on the 4Q commentary, but I just want to make sure I understand it, particularly in America. So it sounds like on the residential side of things, things are very strong, right. Your backlogs at record levels, electronics is supposed to be up in the fourth quarter. So the implied step down then in 4Q, is that just non-res is going to get worse in 4Q versus 3Q? And maybe just any color intra-quarter on how trends played out in non-res would be helpful? Dave Petratis : I would say, you know, getting back to Patrick's comments, the slowdown, in some cases shut down in Q2 set us up for a nice backlog to saw through in Q3. We did a good job in that. Primarily commercial institutional demand has softened And we see that in Q4. That's how I describe it from a demand standpoint. As you look at the margin profile in that, the res demand is extremely strong, but we - you know, it creates a mix issue. Our commercial institutional is significantly more profitable. And those factors work through the fourth quarter. Joe Ritchie : Okay, great. I appreciate the clarification. And then I guess, you know, just the follow on question, thinking about this, you know, a little bit longer term. You know, ahead of the pandemic, you guys were pretty front-footed and discussing some of the, you know, not just like supply constraints, but really labor constraints in some of these projects, moving to completion. I guess, as you think about the institutional or non-res markets, and what you have in your backlog? Like, how much more visibility do you have, I guess, into 2021? And how much more backlog do you have to complete? I'm just trying to understand, like, how much we've worked through versus what's left to complete before we kind of head into 2021? Dave Petratis : So as I think at 2021, you know, I talked about spec writing, we're looking at, you know, at incoming order demand, especially, you know, project related, and the backlog. You know, incoming project quotes, again, muted. Our backlog, if you look at it over 36 months, is in the low end of the range, it's not unhealthy. But we would typically go into a softer backlog this time of a year, but again it's on the low range, then, you know, you've got - you know, to get your crystal ball out and my crystal ball, the economics that we continue to look at, suggest softness, and that's what we suggest. Joe Ritchie : Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you, all. Operator : The next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Dave Petratis : Good morning. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just moving away from the top line for a second, very good productivity performance in the quarter with the margins up, year-on-year you booked some more restructuring charges. So maybe as we look at 2021, is there any way that you could describe the sort of carryover fixed cost savings into next year that should support margins? And any sense around, perhaps temporary costs that might flow back into the P&L? Really just trying to get a sense of any major moving parts? The margins next year, aside from volumes? Patrick Shannon : Yeah, Julian. I would characterize it this way. You may recall, in the last quarter conference call, we kind of outlined what we are doing this year, you know, there's $80 million kind of cost reduction take out for 2020. And we characterize that as kind of three components, which was the discretionary, variable, structural, permanent type of cost savings. And if you look at those specifically on the permanent structural cost savings, to answer your question, we've been added, you know, pretty solidly, I'd say, over the last couple of quarters. We're now hitting, I'd say a full stride, in terms of the cost takeout associated with that. We've identified some additional measures as well, that will help us into 2021. So there's carryover benefit, particularly in the first half of 2021, that will help mitigate some of these variable components that Boomerang back next year. So I look at those, you know, maybe we're a little upside down. If you kind of look at those two independently and sum them up. We will continue to evaluate our cost structure going forward and adjust as necessary. Basis of future demands are always looking at that. However, we will continue to invest in the business, that's a core part of our strategy, particularly on the seamless access and growth opportunities associated with that, to really position us well on the growth prospects associated with that going forward, as we exit COVID-19. So there's going to be some pressure there relative to those components, and then you're going to have unfortunately, unfavorable mix associated with strength in residential, better than anticipated and some continued softness associated with the no-residential markets. Julian Mitchell : Very helpful. Thank you, Patrick. And maybe my follow up would be also away from the top line, just on the balance sheet. I think in the prepared remarks around cash usage, you mentioned that the buyback may be resuming. So maybe just help us understand the appetite for share buybacks, how quickly you want to get underway on that. And how attractive M&A opportunities are today? Patrick Shannon : So first on the M&A, I would say, you know, core part of our strategy to continue to evaluate opportunities that are core in our business, expanding product or our market presence, important, continue to evaluate where we can look at assets that help us from a technology perspective, particularly around this whole connectivity, and seamless access, and then participating in that growth. So we're active, looking at various opportunities. I would say, there's fewer assets on the market, specific and core to our business. And, so kind of if you assume that there's limited M&A activity, we would pivot more toward shareholder distribution, which we - I just want to clarify, we are in the market, and will be in Q4 to help, you know, continue to put cash to use for the benefit of our shareholders, enhance shareholder returns. We think it's a good investment, relative to where we trade today. And so we'll continue to be active in the market. Dave Petratis : I would add to it from an M&A position, we can go where we need to go. We've got, you know, the dry powder and firepower, I think it's an, you know, an enviable position, leaning harder towards electronics, software that accelerate and add capabilities to our value proposition. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thanks, Dave and Patrick. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Hi, guys. Good morning. Dave Petratis : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : I just want to dive in a little bit in institutional markets, specifically education and healthcare. If I look at the bond issuance year-to-date, I think as of end of September, education bond issuance was up almost 40%, and healthcare, I think was down 2%, effectively flat. So within those dynamics, so you know, in education, the pushback were getting is that, okay, so we are going to have bond - you know, we are going to have new bond issuance in November, I guess people will vote for it. But how - what are you hearing from your customers on the education side about the fact is that, I guess some people, they are getting tuition, but maybe they're not getting rents for the dorm rooms. So how much pressure is education sector under? And then for healthcare, right, the issue there is elective surgeries, which are coming back, but how are the conversations going with the healthcare providers in terms of whether they get back to normal? So that's sort of part one, education and healthcare? You know, what are you seeing in those two verticals into next year? Dave Petratis : So I've had more dialogue on the educational side, and I'd say generally optimistic, and in line with the Bank of America research. As I've had new dialogues, you know, with a few university presidents, their capital projects continue to move forward and have funding at the state level or the private level, depending on the institution. I think there's something to recognize within that, though, Andrew, is the small projects, the break fix, the preventive maintenance, those facility teams are inundated [ph] by just the problems of the day in dealing with students at all levels. So I tend to be net positive and in that college campus K through 12, Allegion will get more than its fair share of the business. On the hospital side. I see the opportunity, the hospital system has been severely tested and investment will go back into that, but it will be second half of \u201821 and into \u201822. Andrew Obin : And just a follow up question, can you just give us any color on what\u2019s happening was your market share in discretionary retrofit market? I know it's been sort of a couple years ago been a big initiative, you guys have done very well, I believe you continue to do well. But any color on what's happening there? Dave Petratis : You know, we continue to execute our ground game in terms of the discretionary working with our wholesale partners. A large partner, just shifted completely to Allegion, opening price point, mid price point project. So it continues to be a net positive. Andrew Obin : So continue to gain market share, so I'll leave that away. Dave Petratis : Yeah. And I would say the command of our supply chain helps us there, when things are locked up, you know, because of challenges in other parts of the world. Again, you've heard me say, Andrew, our supply chain is simpler, and it gives us opportunities to have dialogues, we can keep the flow of product going. Andrew Obin : Fantastic. And congratulations on well executed quarter. Dave Petratis : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : The next question comes from Tim Wojs of Baird. Please go ahead. Dave Petratis : Good morning, Tim. Tim Wojs : Hey, guys. Hey, good morning. Nice job on the margins. Maybe just, really the only question I have is just on pricing. You know, as you kind of look at \u201821, maybe some choppiness in non-res continuing into next year. Any change and kind of how you guys think about pricing? You know, in kind of the out here and you know, really just asking because we are starting to see a little bit of incremental kind of raw material inflation, that's kind of popping up to here. So you just kind of commentary on how we should think about price. Dave Petratis : So I would characterize it as you know, solid performance in Q3 in year-to-date 2020. We will continue to push and remain competitive in the market. You're correct, there's going to be some inflationary pressure associated with input costs on commodities, you know, things like steel, and aluminium. We'll continue to push the price dynamic to the extent we can, and again remain competitive. But I would think about it, as you know, we're 1%, maybe a little bit lower realize, kind of on a go forward basis. Tim Wojs : Okay, sounds good. Thanks, guys. Good luck on the rest of the year. Dave Petratis : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from John Walsh of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Walsh : Hi, good morning. Dave Petratis : Good morning. John Walsh : Just wanted to go back to the kind of the language you used around a snapback in the repair, retrofit and small projects activity you're looking at, or anticipating next year. You talked about that large mobile project, which will hit next year. But I'm curious today, if you're seeing your customers make those touchless upgrades in the back half of this year or if it's still more of a conversation with them anticipating doing more of the projects next year? Dave Petratis : We can identify projects and early adopters, but the momentum of those projects will pick up once we get on the other side of COVID. Unless there's a burning need - when you go in and increase or improve your infrastructure to touchless, waveless connected, it's a bigger project than somebody wants to take on in the middle of a fire fight. John Walsh : Got you. No, that makes sense. And then, you know, just thinking about earlier, when you were talking about the seamless opportunity, you did use the term, you know, thinking about the readers. As I kind of have historically thought about Allegion\u2019s position in that product, it was smaller relative to one of your competitors. But how important is having the reader as part of the solution? You know, as these customers shift into that seamless world? Is that some place where you need to get bigger or just trying to understand how that works? Dave Petratis : So when you think about readers, kind of think about light switches, they are ubiquitous, they're in every room. Is one light switch differentiate another? The answer is no. It's important in the sequence, but what we're really after is to eliminate the card and move that to your edge device, your cell phone. That is going to happen. That's the opportunity that we're going to exploit which complements the touchless environment, it complements higher security levels, because you can not only have one level, but even triple levels of authentication. And you don't ever - you get immediate, you know, what we call the arbitrator of access. With a click of a button access is granted or denied eliminating the needs of cards. That's our opportunity. John Walsh : Great. Appreciate that color. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Deepa Raghavan of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Deepa Raghavan : Hi. Good morning, all. Dave Petratis : Good morning, Deepa. Deepa Raghavan : Hey, good quarter, by the way. Two questions for me. First one is, can you talk about the momentum or the revenue growth that you're seeing in products that are driving this post-COVID world with you know, your touchless, seamless, you talked about contactless, Apple, iPhones, et cetera. Now these look like strong renovation opportunity. So why would you not see continued tailwinds into first half of next year versus your commentary for a snapback only in second half? And also can you touch upon how accretive these tech-heavy products and software is to your margins? And I have a follow up. Dave Petratis : I think you have to put yourself in the middle of a college campus, hospital. And you know, the prioritization of their day and their project work in a COVID reality. As I talked to school administrators, it's not \u2013 those preventative small - preventive maintenance items, small projects, unless it's severely broken, it's just not part of the priority list. It's about people flow. It's about cleaning surfaces. So, you know, when you're in a firefight, and you would be at the University of Florida today, you know, that projects, those small projects don't hit that - even the radar screen. So that's what I see in terms of this moving into the second half. Your follow up, your second question, did you hear it Patrick? Deepa Raghavan : Yeah, sure. Patrick Shannon : So Deepa, on the margin profile, the electronics with the similar type of margin is your traditional mechanical, but a higher selling price and therefore more EBITDA. So to the extent we can continue to push electronics, which we are and we will, that benefits us from an earnings growth perspective. Deepa Raghavan : Great. My follow up- Patrick, was more on the residential, electronics lots performance. As I mentioned yesterday, their smart lock business in residential grew high double-digit percent in Q3. Did you see similar kind of strength? Patrick Shannon : Deepa, I would say this, if we didn't have the supply disruption from a supplier, we would have had one of the strongest residential quarters in the company's history. Deepa Raghavan : Got it. Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : The next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Colton West : Hi, good morning. It's Colton, on for David, congrats on a good quarter. Dave Petratis : Thank you. Colton West : I guess, can you start by walking us through how the residential point of sale growth played out in the quarter and any new trends you're seeing there? Dave Petratis : I would say impressive strength in the e-commerce, you know would indicate share gains. If we look at point of sale, we continue to gain momentum and strength. And it's really across all sectors. I don't think that when people are spending more time in their homes, they're thinking about how do I upgrade and improve my space. I think across DIY, you see that extremely strong trend, one. I think two, the rise in demand for single family home, whether existing or new, we're benefiting from that. Remember, Allegion tends to be the replacement lock of choice. And then we have a suite of electronic products that maybe the best in the industry. And then our supply chain, we have product available, have been able to provide it. So all of those channels, in some cases, our specials, our returns are extended because of the increase in demand. But I think several factors there that are really showing off some res performance. I'd add one more to and I commented on it. Our ability to take our demand up is as good as I've seen in 40 years of manufacturing. Colton West : That's great. I appreciate that. And then as a follow up, you mentioned some supplier headwinds in the third quarter related to electronics, can you give us an update on where your supply chain stands today for the segment? And if there are any risks that could limit growth in the near term? Dave Petratis : With the exception of that one supplier, no disruptions. That doesn't mean the supply chains are not under pressure, but we tend to produce in region and that you know, certainly helps us just think time on the boat. But it's one of the proud points of Allegion. We've been working on that supply chain even under Ingersoll Rand. The simplicity of it, the leanness of it, some of the vertical integration that we did over the last few years as we invest in Allegion has really come back to pay dividends. Colton West : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Kessler of Imperial Capital. Please go ahead. Jeff Kessler : Thank you. Thank you. Good morning, guys. Dave Petratis : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Kessler : Morning. Can you can you break out EMEA and Asia Pacific just a little bit in terms of - granted, they're small, but the fact is that, you know, at some point EMEA has to grow again. Where - let's call it vertically and geographically, what was stronger and what was weaker in EMEA? Dave Petratis : So I think a very good quarter in EMEA, number one. Number two is strengthened our SimonsVoss franchise, which would be SimonsVoss Interflex. Our leader there, Bernhard Sommer really put his foot on the pedal, as we went into the pandemic, had some supply chain strengths that winning in allowed him to capture projects. I also thought our Interflex business did extremely well, which is access software control time and attendance. That business, you know, under some pressure because of - they do a very good job at servicing large manufacturers, especially the auto, aerospace industry, you know, executed well. And I think the numbers suggest that. The other one that's hidden, Jeff is our - what we call global portable security, excellent execution and leadership by John Stanley. Think about it, you can't walk into a bike shop today and find a bike. And that demand has come right into our wheelhouse. We also have been investing in connected technologies that help the location of your bike platform. You know, won some nice business because of that connected capability in the GPS business, that'd be my comments and you know, for the Europe business. Jeff Kessler : Okay. Great. And in the US now that and I think you alluded to, you use the word NFC, but I'm assuming that NFC becomes a key part of the touchless, wireless, three levels of authority, technology. Are there - are you going to be using multiple technologies in terms of getting those projects going? And will it be mainly around NFC or will you be adding various types of Bluetooth to it? I mean, I know I'm getting down in the weeds here. But question - the question really involves, you know, how flexible are you going to be in terms of those technologies and what is - what are you - what are people asking for or what are people negotiating with you for, they just heard the word that Apple is taking this on as well and now it's basically going to be a standard? Or are you getting different types of demand for different types of wireless technology, per either vertical or per type of end user? Dave Petratis : NFC remains important. We're investing and partnering in technologies like thread that you're probably the only person on the phone that's aware of a thread technology And I think we continue to be very comfortable on our foundation of being open. And, you know, making good segmentation decisions that allow Allegion to grow, but also servicing our customers. Jeff Kessler : Okay. Just as a last follow up to this. As far as getting this out there was this at the beginning going to cost you more to get these technologies. I mean, you've obviously had wireless technologies coming out into the marketplace for several years now. But is - are these new technologies going to cost you more to get out there? Or is this is as you said before, the mark - ultimate margins remain about the same, where do the innards of those margins differ from mechanical? Dave Petratis : Again, margins consistent at a higher selling price. What fascinates me is our position in seamless access opens up new business opportunities, in terms of helping customers simplify their world. So an example of this would be at the University of Texas Austin, where we are the sole supplier on access, they manage 80,000 credentials today. I can get them out of that business and provide new value propositions, higher level of security that I think you know, customers will be more than willing to offer, create a new revenue streams and ecosystems for Allegion. Jeff Kessler : Great. Thank you very much. Dave Petratis : Be safe. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Martineau for any closing remarks. Tom Martineau : Thank you. And we'd like to thank everyone for participating in today's call. Have a safe day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

For the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up and then re-enter the queue. We would like to give everyone an opportunity given the time allotted. Now I would like to turn the call over to Dave. David D. Petratis: Thanks Tom. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. 2020 was an extremely difficult year, perhaps the most challenging that I have encountered during my career. I want to take the time to acknowledge the sacrifice and hard work of our employees in helping Allegion deliver strong results in the face of the obstacles presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Thank you for your diligence, flexibility, and perseverance.  Please go to Slide 4. Despite the pressures posed by the global pandemic, Allegion experienced only a modest topline revenue decline in 2020 and we saw pockets of strength during the year. The business, as you may remember, performed extremely well in the first quarter and in the second half of the year the Americas residential business, SimonsVoss business, Interflex, and global portable security businesses in Europe realized good growth. Although revenue was down modestly for the year, we expanded adjusted operating margins by 20 basis points, aided by quickly implementing restructuring and cost management actions to mitigate the volume related COVID-19 impacts. Allegion produced record adjusted earnings per share and increased available cash flow by more than 20 million versus the prior year. We strengthened foundational elements of Allegion\u2019s culture around safety, sustainability, inclusion, diversity, and engagement, which will help drive our continued success as a company. I'm very proud of our commitment to employee safety and customer excellence, which remain top priorities. In 2020 we made improvements in all of our employee safety metrics, which are already industry leading. This has and will be our North Star. I believe that the time and resources we have invested in safety since then paid us back in 2020. We were able to keep our essential employees working and took extra protections to keep people safe, whether they were on the sites or working remotely and our dedication to customer excellence allowed us to better serve our customers. Today, Allegion is greener and cleaner, reducing greenhouse gases and water usage throughout the year. We paid considerable attention to drive progress on inclusion and diversity, creating a strategic framework and leadership commitment to our action agenda. Our team is significantly more engaged, meaning our global employees are more committed to our vision and our workforce than ever before. All Allegion employees are surveyed annually by Gallup in their native language. Our engagement has seen solid improvements since we have been a standalone company. Please go to Slide 5 and I'll walk you through the fourth quarter financial summary. Revenue for the fourth quarter was 727.3 million, an increase of 1.1%. Organic revenue declined six tenths of a percent. Currency tailwinds more than offset the organic revenue decline and the impact of divestitures. Organic revenue in the quarter included Americas residential, SimonsVoss, Interflex, and global portable security in Europe and Australia and New Zealand in the Asia Pacific. These gains were offset by expected headwinds experienced in our Americas non-residential business. Patrick will share more detail on the regions in a moment.  Adjusted operating margin increased by 150 basis point in the fourth quarter as we saw the benefits from restructuring and cost reduction actions mitigate deleverage from volume declines. Adjusted earnings per share of a $1.49 increased $0.21, more than 16% versus the prior year. High operating income, favorable share count, and year-over-year tax rates accounted for the increase. Available cash flow for the year came in at 443.2 million, an increase of over 20 million versus the prior year. Higher adjusted earnings and lower capital expenditures were the driving forces for the increase.  I encourage all of you to review the body of work and execution of the Allegion team globally versus our competitors and peers in 2020. Solid top line performance in a pandemic, margin expansion, and record cash flows. During the year we leaned out our structure, increased our investment in technology, and retained our go to market resources and strengthened the engagement of our worldwide team in a pandemic, positioning Allegion to exit the COVID plague as a stronger company. Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our strategic agenda and 2021 outlook. Patrick Shannon : Thanks, Dave and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to Slide Number 6. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter 2019 reported earnings per share was $0.86, adjusting $0.42 for charges related to restructuring, trade name impairments, as well as loss on divestitures in Turkey and Colombia, the 2019 adjusted earnings per share was a $1.28. Operational earnings were the primary driver for the year-over-year increase. As indicated, operational results increased earnings per share by $0.13 as favorable price, productivity, and material deflationary impacts more than offset reduced volume, related deleverage, as well as plant inefficiencies due to COVID-19.  Favorable year-over-year, tax rate and share count drove another $0.06 and $0.02 increase respectively. Interest and other income were slightly positive and offset the slight reduction associated with incremental investments during the quarter. This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2020 earnings per share of a $1.49, an increase of $0.21, or 16.4% compared to the prior year. Lastly, we have a $0.48 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring, M&A costs, impairments, as well as a loss on health for sale assets. This is related to our decision to divest the QMI door business in the Middle East, which is expected to close in Q1 subject to normal regulatory approvals. After giving effect to these items, you arrive at the fourth quarter. 2020 reported earnings per share of $1.01. Please go to Slide Number 7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the fourth quarter, as well as for the full year 2020. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we experienced a 0.6% organic revenue decline in the fourth quarter. As shown in the trending chart, we saw sequential improvement in the organic revenue decline, as well as positive total growth of 1.1%, with currency tailwinds mitigating the organic decline and divestitures. Price continued to remain strong and helped to offset some of the volume decline. With the fourth quarter performance, you can see that total revenue was down 4.7% for the full year with organic revenue decline of 4.8%. All three regions ended the year down organically with Americas down 4.2%, EMEA lower by 5.1%, and Asia Pacific off 10.6%. All regions experienced organic revenue declines from the prior year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Please go to Slide Number 8. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were 521.2 million, down 1% and 0.7% on an organic basis. The region continued to deliver solid price realization. On volume Americas residential was outstanding, experiencing mid 20% growth boosted by robust retail point of sale, new home construction and electronics growth, which nearly offset the expected decline in the non-residential business caused by lower new construction and discretionary project delays. Electronics revenue was slightly down with good growth in residential offset by reduced commercial electronics, driven by delays in discretionary projects.  We continue to see electronics and touchless solutions as long-term growth drivers and expected electronics accelerated growth to resume when market conditions normalize. Americas adjusted operating income of 148.5 million decreased 3.5% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter was down 70 basis points. The decrease was driven primarily by volume deleverage, plant inefficiencies due to the challenges from COVID-19, and unfavorable mix partially offset by benefits from cost reduction actions, restructuring benefits, and material deflation.  Please go to Slide Number 9. Fourth quarter revenues for the EMEA region were 165.3 million, up 10.5% in total and up 3.1% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by good price realization and strength in our SimonsVoss, Interflex, and global portable security businesses. These businesses demonstrated resiliency throughout the year and are well-positioned to continue profitable growth in 2021. Currency tailwinds added to the total growth. EMEA adjusted operating income of 24.9 million increased 49.1% versus the prior year period, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 390 basis points. Also note that these results absorbed a 5.1 million environmental remediation charge, which had a 310 basis point negative impact on adjusted operating margins. The margin expansion was primarily driven by the organic growth leverage and the benefits of the restructuring and cost control actions taken throughout the year. Please go to Slide Number 10. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were 40.8 million, down 6.4% versus the prior year. Organic revenue was down 11.9%. The decline was driven by continued weakness in Korea and slightly offset by growth in Australia and New Zealand, particularly in the residential business. Currency tailwinds muted some of the organic revenue decline. Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was 8.2 million, an increase of 6.3 million, with adjusted operating margins up 1570 basis points versus the prior year period. Approximately 4 million of the income increase was attributable to a gain on the sale of a building. Even excluding that, the benefits realized from restructuring and cost control actions drove substantial margin expansion.  Please go to Slide Number 11. Available cash flow for 2020 came in at 443.2 million, which is an increase of 20.6 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by higher adjusted net earnings and lower capital expenditures. Looking at the chart to the right, it shows working capital as a percent of revenues decreased based on a four-point quarter average. This was driven by reduced working capital needs from the lower volume. The business continues to generate strong cash flow and conversion of net earnings. Liquidity and our capital structure are in a great position and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize working capital and drive effective cash flow conversion. We resumed share repurchases and acquired approximately 1.1 million shares for approximately $115 million during the fourth quarter. We also announced a 13% increase in our dividend payout later in March. I will now hand the call back over to Dave. David D. Petratis: Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide Number 12. There's no doubt that throughout the fourth quarter and 2020 as a whole, our vision of seamless access and a safer world continued to drive our business forward. Despite the pandemic and resulting market headwinds, our vision and strategy are progressing on many fronts. We continued our commitments and investments to R&D in 2020, creating a robust pipeline of new product development projects across both our core brands and new electronic product offerings.  Our recent acquisition of Yonomi is an example of it's infusing outside thinking, and yet in another way we're making digital and software investments to meet customer needs now and in the future. Yonomi, will accelerate Allegion\u2019s digital journey and product offerings. And our vision remains anchored and are strategic pillars, delivering new value and access and to be the partner of choice, but also in the strength of our historic brands. In fact, throughout the pandemic's Schlage, Von Duprin, SimonsVoss, and Interflex among others in our portfolio, demonstrated both flexibility and creativity to meet customers immediate and changing needs. I couldn't be prouder of how the team grounded our company in sound business practices, while strategic\u2026 Operator : Forgive me, ladies and gentlemen, it appears we are having technical difficulties with the speaker location. Please standby while we try to reconnect. Pardon me ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dave Petratis. Please go ahead. David D. Petratis: Okay, I apologize for that audience. We will go to Slide 12. There's no doubt throughout the fourth quarter and 2020 as a whole, our vision of seamless access and a safer world continue to drive our business forward. Despite the pandemic and resulting market headwinds, our vision and strategy are progressing on many fronts. We continued our commitment and investments to R&D in 2020, creating a robust pipeline of new product and development projects across both our core brands and new electronic product offerings. Our recent acquisition of Yonomi is an example of infusing outside thinking and yet, in another way, we're making digital and software investments to meet customer needs now and in the future. Yonomi will accelerate Allegion\u2019s digital journey and product offerings. And our vision remains anchored in our strategic pillars, delivering new value and access and to be the partner of choice, but also on the strength of our historic brands. In fact, throughout the pandemic Schlage, Von Duprin, SimonsVoss, and Interflex among others in our portfolio demonstrated both flexibility and creativity to meet customers immediate and changing needs.  I couldn't be prouder of our team grounded our company in sound business practices was strategically investing for our future to position Allegion for growth as markets rebound. I have said this before and I'll say it again, because of how we've managed our business and how we are investing and because of the engagement, commitment, and resiliency of our employees I believe we'll exit the pandemic stronger than when we started and we are committed to advancing environmental, social, and governance topics. They are important to the company and the communities where we live.  Please go to slide 13. Another example from the quarter that demonstrates our focus on Allegion\u2019s future and our vision of seamless access is the creation of Allegion International. As we announced in December, Allegion International officially launched this year on January 1 as a consolidation of the former EMEA and Asia Pacific operating segments. Tim Eckersley is now leading Allegion International, and we are excited to leverage his broad experiences there. As a veteran of the security industry and high growth technologies, and as a longtime leader within our business. Creating Allegion International is designed to drive speed and efficiency by moving decision closer to the customer, simplifying our operating segments, and by reducing overhead in our non-U.S. operations. With this updated operating model in place, we expect to accelerate momentum in electronics growth, software and seamless access in those international markets. Again, we have elite brands with rich histories in Europe and Asia Pacific. While Tim is now leading the way for Allegion International, I want to welcome Luis Orbegoso as Senior Vice President of the Americas. If you haven't already, I encourage you to read our press release or look up Luis's bio on allegion.com. Luis brings a wealth of diverse leadership experiences spanning multiple industries, geographies, and cultures and has a track record of managing through teams through transformation with a focus on operational and customer excellence. He possesses a deep understanding of smart home security, cloud technology, consumer access solutions, as well as commercial and institutional safety, which support our strategic priorities. Needless to say, Tim and Luis are both dedicated to our leadership commitments, delivering value to our customer and shareholders and driving our strategy forward. We are focused and disciplined heading into 2021.  Please go to Slide 14. Looking ahead at the 2021 non-residential business, it's important to understand the cyclical nature of this market and where we fit in. In general, we are a late cycle, meaning our products are installed up to a year, sometimes longer after new construction projects start. Our views on commercial institutional markets have not changed. I expect new construction to remain soft this year with institutional markets recovering faster than commercial. I also believe that this recovery will be faster than the 2008 downturn and thus we have maintained our sales and specification capability and capacity while continuing to invest in innovation. Relative to the broader market and competitors Allegion continues to perform well. We continue to provide innovative solutions in our core markets, as well as underserved market opportunities to drive profitable growth.  As K through 12 schools, college campuses, and healthcare begin to normalize with regard to the pandemic, we would expect discretionary projects on the non-residential side to pick up in the back half of the year as pent up demand begins to break loose. The residential piece of the Americas business continues to be a bright spot and is expected to grow in 2021 as the undersupply of single family homes continues to be corrected. In addition to the builder channel, DIY projects will continue to drive opportunities as consumers invest in their homes and adopt electronic solutions. We anticipate strength in residential to persist in the foreseeable future. Seamless access, software, and electronics continue to be a long-term growth driver and will remain our top investment priority. They are the future of Allegion. With a strengthened residential and softness in commercial and institutional, we project total organic revenue in the Americas to be down 3% to 4% in 2021.  In the Allegion International segments, markets continue to recover and we expect growth in our electronics and system integration businesses, SimonsVoss, Interflex, as well as global portable security business. Currency tailwinds more than offset the expected divestiture of our QMI business and contribute to total growth. For the region, we project total growth of 6% to 7% with organic growth of 2% to 3%. All in for total Allegion we are projecting total revenues to be down a 0.5% to 1.5% and organic revenue decline 1.5% to 2.5%. Please go to Slide 15. Our 2021 outlook for adjusted earnings per share is $4.70 to $4.85. As indicated adjusted operating earnings are expected to decrease 5% to 8%, driven by reduced volumes as a result of the non-residential end markets, incremental investments, and inflationary impacts. We are not immune to the macro-inflationary headwinds especially from steel and electronics components, as well as with freight and transportation. For 2021, we expect an EPS headwind of $0.25 to $0.30 related to direct material input costs and freight inflation alone. We will continue to drive price and productivity to offset but the net benefit will be less than prior years.  Incremental investments continue to be a priority as we remain focused on accelerating electronics and seamless access, growth and support of our vision and strategy. These incremental investments predominantly relate to added R&D and engineering capabilities to further develop, enhance, and accelerate new product development. The combination of interest and other expense is expected to be a headwind as some of the more formidable items that we experience in 2020 are non-recurring. Our outlook assumes a full adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 12% and an increase from 11.2% in 2020. It also assumes outstanding weighted average diluted shares of approximately 91 million. The outlook additionally includes $0.10 to $0.15 per share for restructuring charges during the year. As a result, reported EPS is projected to be $4.55 to $4.75. We are projecting our available cash flow for 2021 to be in the $400 million to $420 million range.  Please go to Slide 16. We are pleased with our 2020 performance in a pandemic. We saw expanded -- we expanded our operating margins, increased adjustable earnings per share, and delivered higher available cash flow in a difficult macro environment in which we were operating. We have taken actions that will allow Allegion to be leaner and more focused on 2021 as we and the rest of the world navigate and emerge from the pandemic, Allegion will be a stronger company and we are positioned for long-term success. As always, our execution and commitment to driving solid results will remain high. Allegion\u2019s future is bright. Patrick will now -- Patrick and I will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question today comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Yes, good morning. Can you hear me? David D. Petratis: I can hear you perfect. Sorry for the break in our delivery. Andrew Obin : Oh no, don't worry about it. So first question I have is just how you think about North America comps, because if I look at the revenue it's just -- it's a highly unusual year and that Q1 was super strong last year, Q2 very weak, and then things sort of flattened out. So as I think about comps getting positive into the second half, is the issue really first quarter being very strong and then second quarter you resume positive growth in the second quarter or there is any sort of specific dynamic in the second quarter that you see, sorry to get so granular but it was just highly unusual year and I just want to understand your sort of view on second half recovery in 2021? David D. Petratis: So I'll jump in here and Patrick can clean up. I'd say as we reflected on 2019 and 2020, I actually saw some softening in the broader building markets as we exited the first half of 2019. Again, we're a late cycle and we carried extremely strong backlog that really helped us through Q1. Then you had the blow up and again we used that strong backlog and the wrap up of projects to really put up, I think, a respectable 2020 for Allegion as we navigated through that. As we go into 2021 and 2022, the backlogs are softened, the new project pipeline is down, and we've got to reposition that. Patrick can talk more about the comps on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Patrick Shannon : Yeah, so Andrew as you have highlighted, I mean you got it right, Q1 is going to be a difficult comparison because we had really good growth, particularly in the non-residential business. So that's going to be a really tough comp for us. Q2 obviously becomes much easier, particularly on the residential business where we had a plant closure in our Mexico facilities, and we're kind of playing catch up when they reopen, the back half of the quarter. And then, kind of things return I'd say more on a normalized basis in the back half of the year. So, first half it is going to be say down, Q1, up Q2, and then kind of more of a normalized basis, but continued strength in a residential business. Non-residential challenged first half of the year, but getting better as we progress throughout the year, particularly as it relates to discretionary project based business. And, when people start returning to work relative to the easing of the COVID impact, we should start seeing some improvement on that side of the business. Hopefully, that answers what you're looking for. Andrew Obin : Yeah, and just a follow-up question, bigger picture question. I think the market we've seen some companies going public that are sort of trying to address building management software and sort of integrate software with hardware, you have some of you larger sort of competitors who do building systems also focus on building management software. And if you look at the numbers, the end market growth opportunity just seems very, very attractive. And I know you guys have thought about it, but I was just wondering, how do you think about Allegion\u2019s ability to participate in what seems to be a very exciting growth, not just in hardware, electronic hardware, but also the software market that goes together with it that seems to be growing quite fast over the next several years? Thank you. And I know you guys have thought about it, but we'd love to get more color. David D. Petratis: So I think, Andrew, we have thought very deeply about it, as we rolled out our vision of seamless access almost three years ago. We see the opportunity, we began to venture investments which was amplified by our full acquisition of Yonomi. But we think through the cloud and connect -- great connected products, there's a key role here for Allegion to play. And we continue to invest in position. I would also say the success that we're having in SimonsVoss and Interflex as an indicator of the attractiveness in the market, where both software and really cool hardware comes together. We're pointed right at that market and think that we can carve out a very attractive position for the company. Andrew Obin : Alright, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Chan of Baird. Please go ahead. Josh Chan : Hi, good morning Dave, Patrick, and Tom. David D. Petratis: Good morning. Josh Chan : My first -- good morning, my first question has to do with sort of a combination of international under Tim. I was just wondering if, under his leadership are you anticipating any change in strategy or at least focus, areas of focus versus the historical pattern there in their respective businesses? David D. Petratis: So, first, the creation of Allegion International, we've got great confidence in our General Managers. To start there one of the key moves was to simplify and reduce the overall cost of running the international segment. Two is, within those portfolios we think we're well positioned to move ahead, especially as electronic as a driver. Our Gainsborough offerings are being up to date in terms of electronics and we continue to drive the SimonsVoss and Interflex with new products and a supply chain that I think has helped us grow during the pandemic. Third is global portable security with kryptonite, AXA, and Trelock has performed into a nice operating position as demand for bikes and demand for growth as an OEM supplier have been nice. So we expect Tim to advance that and lean into the electronics growth and potentially further acquisitions in that space. Patrick Shannon : And Josh, I would just add too, you saw it in the numbers we exited 2020 in really good shape. Good organic growth as Dave mentioned on the SimonsVoss and Interflex and global portable security. We would expect that to continue obviously in 2021 leveraging the good work that was done in the back half of 2020. And then on the operational margin performance outstanding Q4 and our outline has always been to continue to improve our margin profile associated with our international region and we would expect that to continue going forward. Again relative to some of the cost actions we took early in 2020 you saw that come through in the year, and we expect that momentum to continue in 2021. Josh Chan : Yeah, that's great -- thank you. And my follow-up is on the non-res specification business recognizing that that's a longer cycle business. Are you seeing any sort of uptick in the early stages of the design process and where in terms of verticals might you be seeing any types of movement or improvement there in terms of the early stages of the design? David D. Petratis: So our specification levels have remained strong, and we have continued to invest in digital capability and keeping that specifying capability strong. So we're in a good position. We expect to see a rebound in the second half. There's not been a lot of activity on the campuses of the world, especially the campuses of North America. And as we normalize, we expect some pickup in the second half. As we look at the overall project load, we see positive traction as does institutional products -- projects reload, but also in the hospital sector, where we're very nicely positioned. That whole structure has been severely tested and clearly the economics would suggest that that will be a continued opportunity when we get to the other side of that pandemic, Josh. Josh Chan : Great, thanks for the color and thanks for the time. David D. Petratis: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Please go ahead. David MacGregor : Yes, good morning everyone. Thanks for all the color on the outlook and as you pointed out your cyclical business, organic growth is going to be soft this year. So I guess that raises the question, given the strength of your cash flow with inorganic growth and so on I am just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the acquisition growth opportunity in 2021, do we see any departure from the pattern of more bolt-on transactions, do we start leaning into perhaps larger deals as a way to support that acquisition growth? And I guess I'll -- overall just how confident are you in your ability to deliver growth by acquisitions? David D. Petratis: I'd say number one strong message from our Board of Directors pulled this lever. Two, we've been active and it's -- we continue to have a pipeline of assets that we aspire for and sometimes you got to be patient. I've always felt that our execution as a company puts pressure on that acquisition pipeline that we aspire for. And I would say the pandemic will force decisions among some of those targets that we acquire that move up into the mid major range. We certainly have made numerous acquisitions here, more a string of pearls. We tend to like things that look more like SimonsVoss and Interflex technology that can help enable our capabilities. And as we think about this world of seamless access, going in with accretive targets that will solve new problems for multifamily, for college campuses where we have a unique position on the door that must be connected. Dave, I remind myself, that hardware is hard and we're doing a great job of connecting that. And we've got the opportunity to come in there with connected devices that will be accelerated through Yonomi, thin cloud opportunities that open up opportunities for growth for Allegion. David MacGregor : Thanks for that. Just a second question, I guess a two part, what's your tax rate risk around Biden's rate increases if those two come to pass? And then secondly, are you kind of -- is there any aspect of your story that you consider to be an infrastructure play such that if we get infrastructure stimulus and infrastructure support legislation, there could be growth drivers there that are not currently reflected in your guidance? Thank you. Patrick Shannon : So on the tax rates, like any company, multi-industrial company we would be exposed to a rate increase legislative change. We will have to see what happens but that would put obviously pressure on the rate going up. And so we'll just have to kind of see where that goes. Right now our guidance assumes no legislative changes. On the infrastructure spending, obviously, with any money kind of kicking back to the state, local government, so those types of things, I think, would benefit Allegion down the road. David D. Petratis: I would say in particular, they're still great or large infrastructure needs K through 12 schools. I think the average school in the United States about 40 years. The security needs, certainly are always there and state municipal government will be investing in that, as well as rethinking some of the challenges that they face during the pandemic. We clearly have the ability to control capacity inside a building, increase the security through electronics, and we think we're in a great position as a company and infrastructure investment I think will naturally follow in those public spaces. David MacGregor : Okay, thank you very much. David D. Petratis: Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning guys. David D. Petratis: Hey, Josh. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Just a couple questions here. I guess first on the residential side. I know there's some inventory fill that's still going on, clearly strong growth in the quarter. Where do we sit on that and I guess, when do you expect to get back to normal, Dave, I think you said it was going to run through mid-year and I know Patrick reminded us earlier that it was going to be particularly easy comps on resi. So anything we should keep in mind on channel fell or anything else that would kind of add some lumpiness to the resi growth profile here? David D. Petratis: I think the mid-year target to normalize backlogs was still the aspiration. We saw our backlog shrink a little bit in December. But we've got work to do in terms of replenishing that channel. We sent a very strong message to our building partners that are non-standard product lead times have been reduced dramatically. We think that will help us grow versus the competition. And we've got new electronic offerings coming out in the second half of the year to match our industry leading Schlage encode products. So, feel good about it but normalization, Josh, certainly by mid-summer barring any blow ups. And, I'd say there's pressure on all manufacturers, especially around the chip thing, our supply chain navigating that wealth, but if -- I don't see it getting materially worse but the pandemic still is having an effect on global supply chains. And again, our strength shines pretty brightly there but mid-year we'll be out of this in a normal way. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Okay, perfect. And then just a follow-up here. Obviously, decrementals have a lot of things going on between inflation mix, you mentioned freight as well. Maybe some way to kind of give some sensitivity because they look pretty heavy, especially including the investment. But we're also talking about small declines and below our mixed business growing and higher mixed business declining. If non-resi does show some upside through the year, what sort of incremental should we put on that growth, is it kind of the 40% to 50%, that we've kind of grown accustomed to since that number is already fully loaded for investments or is there something else working here because, again, small numbers on the top line in terms of movement can distort the margin line? David D. Petratis: So I would characterize it this way and hopefully this is helpful as you think about the margin profile for next year or 2021 as it relates to Americas. So a couple things and you touched on one specific relative to our investments that are incremental, associated with R&D and engineering to really push forward the electronics, enhance our product offering going forward. Most of that incremental spend is attached to Americas and so that alone will put pressure on the margin profile associated with Americas. In addition to that you have the incremental inflation that we have highlighted, $0.25 to $0.30 pressure on material input cost. We will do our best to offset that with pricing. But if we break even just the -- math would suggests you're going to have margin pressure attached to that, and then you layer on top of that the mix component, i.e. residential growing faster than non-residential and the non-residential business profile having a higher margin profile, which suggests some additional mix there. So Americas margins will be under pressure in 2021 associated with those three things. We will continue to drive productivity and those types of things to help mitigate that, but there's going to be margin pressure. To come to your second question relative to any growth in the increments associates non-residential, yes. There's going to be some improvement, if we can experience growth in the back half of the year. And you know how we've leveraged historically, I would expect that to continue. And let me make one more point, the margin profile for 2021 being under pressure I view is temporary. Okay, this is a market dynamic, it's not a structural issue associated with Allegion. When business comes back and it will, margin profiles will get better, okay. We will continue to grow margin and we're not in a situation where we've maximized our margin going forward. Patrick Shannon : I would also add, we certainly got cost out in 2020 and I consciously kept my foot on the accelerator on our specifying and revenue generating resources. We've taken care of these teams through the downturn, and I expect us to get more than our fair share on the upside. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Alright, thanks for the color Dave and Patrick. David D. Petratis: Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Please go ahead. Chris Snyder : Thank you for the question. Good morning. So just following up on the 2021 Americas seasonality, is it fair to think that the first half of the year could be up year-on-year just given the easy Q2 comp and then typically you get some level of positive seasonality into the quarter or is that just going to be overwhelmed by the cyclical pressure? And if the first half of the year is up year-on-year, the guidance would suggest pretty material declines in the back half, so hoping you could provide a little bit of color on that? David D. Petratis: Yeah, so it is -- so yes, to answer your question succinctly. First, that can be up relative to 2020. Why? It's because of Q2 kind of given the easy comps there. And as Dave mentioned earlier, we're still working off the backlog if you will associated with the residential business. The residential business in Q2 2020 was severely depressed because of our plant closures. And as we progress throughout 2020 and the markets POS continue to accelerate, we're having a hard time catching up with demand. That's going to be worked off if you will in the first half and so the residential business in of itself will be up significantly. Non-resi top comp in Q1, but it kind of normalizes in the back half of the year. Chris Snyder : So appreciate all of that color and then just kind of following up. So, for the Americans the guidance of down 300 to 400 bps year-on-year would suggest pretty material duration for Q4 which was down 70 bps organically in the Americas. Is this the result of deeper declines for non-resi from the low double-digit level we saw in Q4 or is it just that residential is normalizing from a mid-20% growth realized in Q4? David D. Petratis: I will take the latter so, the double stack on 25% growth year-over-year, much harder comp if you will. Keep in mind Q4 working down backlog, fulfilling stock orders, getting inventory into the channel, that our assumption is not going to repeat itself for 2021 and consequently you have a much difficult comp. Non-res I would expect the rate of decline to improve as we progress during the course of 2021 because of the discretionary business should begin to recover in the back half. Chris Snyder : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Ryan Merkel of William Blair. Please go ahead. Ryan Merkel : Hey everyone, I guess first off, I had a question on mix and price cost. So what does 2021 guidance assume for the mix headwind and then just clarify, did you say that you expect price to cover costs in 2021? David D. Petratis: So on the price cost dynamic, we would expect price to offset material costs in outbound freight, but we're going to be under pressure to mitigate other inflationary impacts, i.e. packaging and those type of things that are also escalating and some of the carry over cost that kind of boomeranged back in 2021, relative to 2020. But as it relates to the price, direct material, expect to be neutral there. I'm sorry, what was your other question? Ryan Merkel : Mix headwind, what are you assuming guidance for mix headwind? Patrick Shannon : Yeah. So, we don't give specific guidance on that. But there's going to be headwinds, again, the non-res business being our most profitable segments. That being down residential up will create kind of a mixed headwind. That is a component of the margin degradation as realized Americas for 2021. Ryan Merkel : Alright, fair enough. And then secondly, just high level. Dave, as you think about 2021, what is the biggest variable, is it vaccine timing or is it how customers respond to building investments in a post COVID world? David D. Petratis: I think we need to continue to accelerate the vaccine delivery. The faster we can get campuses to normalize, hospitals to normalize that pent up demand of discretionary projects bows back, I think it puts confidence into our channel which is restocking. And people will get back thinking about the management of their facilities long term. So it's -- we can see that. Actually feel better about state and local budgets than I did a few months ago and have done a lot of looking into the drivers of our business coming out of the last downturn, the financial crisis. Overall, macro economies are in better shape. The commercial will go through certainly a churn, what do we do with the retail space, not necessarily our sweet spot, but there'll be opportunities as those spaces are reconfigured. Ryan Merkel : Thanks for the color. David D. Petratis: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Trish Gorman : Hey, good morning. This is Trish Gorman on for Julian. Hey, so maybe just first question on the QMI sale, can you guys talk a little bit more about the rationale behind this, was this function of the financial profile, was it a function of the end market exposure product line, and then maybe any financial impacts you would expect from that near-term? Patrick Shannon : So I'd say one, as you look at the market for oil and gas and things are going to drive that part of the world. Clearly a question mark and soft. I'd say two, where did we want to spend our human capital? Clearly, there was pressure in those end markets and our ability to bring together hardware and door solutions didn't feel it was the optimal time. And during the downturn as part of our strategic review, that came up on the portfolio and we chose to exit. So that's how I would describe that situation. Trish Gorman : Got it. That makes sense. And then maybe just one on the free cash flow guide down kind of high single-digits for 2021. Can you talk about the moving pieces there, how we should think about CAPEX and then maybe working capital through the year? Patrick Shannon : Yeah, so down it's really down to commensurate with the earnings guide. And CAPEX is up a little bit year-over-year. We can kind of hover around this 2% of revenue. Working capital don't see any significant movement there. I mean, we will be under a little pressure, we did benefit from the CARES Act. And there'll be some payments coming and some deferrals we had in 2020. So, net-net I still think pretty good conversion and we'll continue to drive that and maximize it to the extent we can. Trish Gorman : Got it. Thanks, guys. Patrick Shannon : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Jeff Kessler of Imperial Capital. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Kessler : Thank you. And I want to give a quick shout out to Luis who I know from his ADT days, so hello Luis and welcome aboard.  [Multiple Speakers] Yeah, UTC as well, right. First question is specific to -- can you go back over, give some of divergences between major divergence between GAAP and non-GAAP reporting that you're expecting for 2021? Patrick Shannon : Yes, predominantly restructuring. So, it's a continuation of some of the programs we announced, but you just can't book the charge until it's actually incurred. And so we have some continuation of those type of things, and expect some continuation of perhaps one or two kind of new smaller type programs going forward. Jeffrey Kessler : Right. And then I want to get back to that question of COVID, general question of becoming more seamless into, along with some of the core building software, in my travels and obviously in some of the presentations that I am involved with, we've been talking a lot and this is internationally, this is not just here in the U.S. about -- you can't help but run into now hundreds of companies, some small, some tiny, but some real mid, almost mid-size now that are stressing that. While hardware is the mainstay and software is the tool that it uses, this may reverse in the course of the next, let's call it five to eight years. I'm not going to say two to three, five to eight years probably in which the analytics and visitor management and the entire -- lets just call it the entire the entire realm of software being used is going to be what perhaps drives value and what drives margin for the -- when the end user, particularly when they may start making discretionary decisions. Can you just elaborate on that, I know you have talked about the Yonomi acquisition, that's one step without obviously naming names, what are the types of adjacencies, what are the types of reaches you're looking for here? Patrick Shannon : So I'd say number one, I looked at companies, Rockwell Automation, Roper, Schneider, where I spent a part, a clear opportunity to take our legacy positions and thrust them into the new world of connectivity, cloud management, to solve customer needs. So, I think that's important. There clearly will be people coming at it from different angles and levels, so I think, our aspiration will be the partner of choice to have open platforms, important here. With that said, I think there's new problems to be solved in the access and security arena. And I think our unique position on the door, along with partners, investment, and further development, we can go in and solve new problems like why does a building have to be open 16 hours a day, why don't I allow that access through as device or, think about how people move through complex buildings. And I know you have Jeff, I think our unique position with connectivity, API's, and SDKs that connect into thin cloud opportunity that we can get more than our share of the growth in these markets. Jeffrey Kessler : And this is -- you are basing the same, this is worldwide, I'm assuming. Patrick Shannon : Absolutely. I think, particularly look at our success with SimonsVoss and Interflex versus some pretty strong players in that space, incredible for Allegion, and those trends are going to continue. Jeffrey Kessler : Right, great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Patrick Shannon : Alright, good to hear you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Martineau for any closing remarks. Tom Martineau : Thank you. We'd like to thank everyone for participating in today's call. Have a safe day.

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Martineau, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead. Tom Martineau : Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for Allegion's first quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a presentation, which we will refer to in today's call, are available on our website at investor.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website. Please go to Slides 2 and 3. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our most recent SEC filings for description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Today's presentation and commentary include non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details. Dave and Patrick will now discuss our first quarter 2021 results, which will be followed by a Q&A session. Please, for the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and one short follow-up and then reenter the queue. We would like to give everyone an opportunity given the time allotted. Please go to Slide 4. And I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave Petratis : Thanks, Tom. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with the company's first quarter performance. We delivered revenue growth, margin expansion, double digit earnings growth and strong available cash flow against a tough prior year comparable. We continue to make progress on our seamless access strategy, while maintaining the focus on keeping our employees safe and serving our customers efficiently. Let's begin by walking through the first quarter financial summary. Revenue for the first quarter was $694.3 million, an increase of 2.9% or 0.5% organically. The organic revenue increase was driven by strength in the Americas' residential and Allegion's international businesses, offsetting continued softness in Americas' non-residential. Currency tailwinds provided a boost to total revenue and more than offset the impact of divestitures. Patrick will share more detail on the regions in a moment. Adjusted operating margin increased by 30 basis points in the first quarter. We executed extremely well, and the restructuring and cost management actions taken during 2020 along with the volume leverage on the businesses that grew offset the mix headwinds we are experiencing. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.20 increased $0.16 or - 15.4% versus the prior year. The increase was driven by expanded operating income along with favorable other income and share count. Year-to-date available cash flow came in at $105.5 million, an increase of more than $86 million versus the prior year. The increased cash flow was driven by improvement in net working capital, growth and net earnings and reduced capital expenditures. Please go to Slide 5. As we discussed previously, reflecting on 2020 despite the ongoing pandemic, Allegion continues to invest in our future, most notably through our innovation engines. From industrial design, engineering, and IT to ventures, partnerships and acquisitions, we're building a build-borrow-buy approach to accelerate seamless access. Investing in our capabilities, partnering and integration are all core to our innovation strategy. Let's review some of Allegion's innovation and investments. Allegion's Overtur, our cloud-based ecosystem where project teams collaborate on the specification, design and construction of door security and openings expanded in multiple ways during the past year. Key and credential management was added, more functionality and integration for our billing information modeling customers and automation that helps hardware specification writers. Overtur allows digital connectivity to our customers over the life of the structure. It's - proving its value as a single source of truth for hardware requirements and decisions and to empower our partners to work more productively. Our ISONAS brand also launched a significant upgrade of its software platform in - Q1 the Pure Access Cloud 4.0 reader controllers are preconfigured to the cloud and only require a network connection on-site, making the ISONAS system truly plug and play. The software upgrade includes new front-end technology with customized dashboards gives a boost to cybersecurity and anticipate added capabilities and future new devices. Our product innovation spans the world of Allegion. SimonsVoss recently released the SmartLocker, a retrofit, no drilling lock option for lockers and furnitures in schools, hospitals and industrial facilities. This innovation was customer inspired, based on trends and needs in the market. Importantly, it integrates the existing SimonsVoss digital ecosystem, and there's additional functionality to [provide] (ph) or open each lock remotely, to display break-in attempts in the software and to send notifications. And just as our internal innovations continue to delight our customers, innovation is built through key partnerships in our early leadership in the IoT market has established us as a go-to partner. In Q1 Homebase announced that they're working with Allegion and Walmart InHome to enable direct-to-fridge grocery delivery for apartment residents starting in the Kansas City Metro. Homebase enables communities - Homebase enabled communities come with preinstalled Schlage smart locks, meaning, that the Walmart associate making the delivery gets secure, one-time access for entry during a designated timeframe for a delivery. This is a clear demonstration of seamless access adding value to people's everyday lives. Partnering with CBORD, Apple and Android has rapidly expanded seamless access use cases on higher education campuses. By enabling mobile credential technologies, we are part of the ecosystem that supports contactless student IDs for iPhones, Apple Watches and Google [Pay] (ph). CBORD also brings our Von Duprin exit devices into play, giving colleges new remote lockdown and monitoring capabilities. These integrations are good for campus securities and help universities and colleges operate more efficiently and safely. Rounding out our build-borrow-buy approach to innovation, Allegion Ventures continues to invest in companies like Kasa, Mint House, VergeSense and Openpath. We also acquired Yonomi, a technology company and leader in IoT cloud platforms. Founded in 2013, by building automation and enterprise computing experts, Yonomi was the first to create a smart home ecosystem, one that automatically discovers and coordinates devices. Allegion was an early customer and investor. Today Yonomi solutions are used in more than 150 countries connected to millions of IoT devices. IoT - excuse me, Yonomi also holds unique intellectual property that matches well to Allegion's strategic priorities for accelerating growth through seamless access, innovation and meaningful partnership.

You\u2019ll continue to see more examples of investment in innovation through our build-borrow and buy approach in '21 and we look forward to sharing more with you in the future. Patrick will now walk you through the financials, and I'll be back later to discuss our '21 outlook and wrap up. Patrick Shannon : Thanks, Dave and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. If you would, please go to Slide number 6. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter 2020, reported earnings per share was zero. Adjusting $1.04 for charges related to intangible asset impairments, restructuring expenses and integration costs related to acquisitions, the 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $1.04. Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.06 driven by volume leverage, along with continued benefits from cost control measures and restructuring actions taken in 2020. Favorable price and currency also contributed to the increase. The combination of these items offset the unfavorable mix. Favorable other income and interest expense increased earnings per share by $0.08 and was driven primarily by favorable unrealized investment gains in 2021 compared to unrealized investment losses experienced in 2020. Favorable share count drove another $0.03 per share impact more than offsetting the $0.01 reduction from investments. This results in adjusted first quarter 2021 earnings per share of $1.20 an increase of $0.16 cents or 15.4% compared to the prior year. Lastly, we have a $0.02 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring costs. After giving effect to these items, you arrive at the first quarter 2021 reported earnings per share of $1.18. Please go to Slide number 7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue performance for the first quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we experienced a 0.5% organic revenue growth in the first quarter as solid price performance was able to offset lower volume. Although the total company volume was slightly down, we did see strength in the Americas residential and international businesses. Currency also provided a tailwind to total growth and more than offset the impact of divestitures. Please go to Slide number 8. First quarter revenues for the Allegion Americas segment were $498.9 million, down 2.6% on a reported basis and down 2.9% organically. The region continued to deliver good price realization. On volume, Americas residential was outstanding again, experiencing low 20% growth boosted by continued strength in retail point of sale, new home construction and electronics growth which nearly offset the anticipated decline in the non-residential business caused by lower new construction and discretionary project delays. Electronics revenue was down mid single-digits with growth in residential products that was offset by reduced commercial electronics driven by delays in discretionary projects. We continue to see electronics and touchless solutions as long-term growth drivers and expect electronics accelerated growth to resume when market conditions normalize. Americas adjusted operating income of $135.5 million decreased 7.6% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter was down 140 basis points. The decrease was driven primarily by volume deleverage, negative mix and incremental investments partially offset by benefits from cost reduction actions and restructuring. Please go to Slide number 9. First quarter revenues for the Allegion International segment were $195.4 million, up 20.2% and up 11% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by strength across all major geographies and businesses as markets continue to rebound. Part of the year-over-year growth was due to the comparative impact of COVID related shutdowns in the prior year. Favorable currency impacts also contributed to total revenue growth and were slightly offset by divestiture impacts. International adjusted operating income of $18 million increased nearly 1000% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased by 820 basis points. The margin increase was driven primarily by solid volume leverage, benefits from lower operating costs from the restructuring cost control actions taken during 2020 as well as favorable currency impacts. This is also our first quarter reporting under the new Allegion International segment. The transition was seamless and made possible by having strong leadership in place to drive effective change. Please go to Slide number 10. Year-to-date available cash flow for the first quarter 2021 came in at $105.5 million, which is an increase of more than $86 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by improvements in net working capital, higher earnings and reduced capital expenditures. Our strong cash flow generation continues to be an asset of the company. Looking at the chart to the right, it shows working capital as a percent of revenues decreased based on a 4-point quarter average. This was driven by reduced working capital needs from the lower volume throughout 2020, as well as strong collections performance. The business continues to generate strong cash flow and we remain committed to effective and efficient use of working capital. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize working capital and drive effective cash flow conversion. I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2021 outlook. Dave Petratis : Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide 11. We have more visibility into our markets and I am increasingly optimistic on the economic recovery. The Americas residential business continues to be hot and is expected to grow in 2021. We anticipate strength at residential to persist for the foreseeable future. DIY demand remained strong and the construction market is strengthened by a shortage of available new homes, continued low mortgage rates and improved trends in permits and starts. However, completion rates have been lagging starts due to labor and supply shortages, which should improve as we move further past the pandemic. Looking at the Americas non-residential business, we saw demand begin to increase on the repair retrofit projects sooner than we previously anticipated. We expect this trend to continue for the remainder of the year. In new constructions, we are starting to see positive movement in macroeconomic indicators, but it's important to remember the late cycle nature of this market. For 2021, I expect non-residential new construction to remain soft. But the monthly change in the architectural building index, Dodge construction starts and potential stimulus spending are trending favorable and assuming this continues, it will lead to growth in 2022 and beyond. Seamless access, software and electronics continue to be long-term growth drivers and they will remain our top investment priorities. They are the future of Allegion. With these parameters in place, we are now projecting total inorganic revenue in the Americas to be flat to up 1% in 2021. In the Allegion International segments, markets continue to recover and we expect full year growth in most of our international segments led by our Germanic and Global Portable Securities business. We continue to monitor the pace of vaccine rollouts internationally, as this will lead to sustainable improvements in the economic environment. Currency tailwinds more than offset the divestiture of our QMI door business and contribute to total growth. For the region, we are raising our outlook for total revenue growth to 12% to 13% with our organic growth of 7.5% to 8.5%. All in, for total Allegion, we are now projecting total revenue to be up 3% to 4% and organic revenue to increase 2% to 3%. We are also raising earnings per share outlook with reported EPS at a range of $4.85 to $5.05 per share and adjusted EPS to be between $5 and $5.15. This guide incorporates pricing actions to offset direct material inflation, as well as reflecting our supply chain capability to mitigate industry challenges on supply and electronic component shortages. We anticipate that these challenges will persist for the balance of the year and we will continue to monitor and adapt to changing market conditions. Our outlook for available cash flow is also being raised and now projected to be $430 million to $450 million. The outlook assumes investment spend of approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share. The full year adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 12.5%. The outlook for outstanding diluted shares continues to be approximately 91 million. Please go to Slide 12. Allegion is off to a great start. We experienced reported and organic revenue growth, expanded operating margins and delivered strong cash flow. We have solid business fundamentals and a proven ability to execute and adapt to changing and uncertain market conditions. We have managed the business extremely well to set us up for success as markets returned to normal. Macroeconomic indicators and specific indices related to our business are trending positive and I'm increasingly confident in the recovery. The Allegion commitment to shareholders, employees and customers is to be stronger, exiting the pandemic than when we entered, our work continues. I want to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their diligence and dedication during the pandemic. It is their commitment that has driven the company to perform well and accelerated our vision of seamless access in a safer world. Allegion future is bright. Thank you. Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just wanted to dial in on the revised Americas organic sales growth outlook. Maybe just help us understand you know how that guidance increase was split between your residential and your non-residential assumptions changing? And then within non-residential specifically, how should we think about that slope of decline shrinking over the balance of this year as you've been running at a sort of down low double-digit rate for four quarters in a row now? Patrick Shannon : Yeah. Julian so I would characterize it this way. You know, first of all, you know, during the course of the quarter, you know, things progressively got better, particularly as we looked at our non-residential business. And by that, I mean just kind of the level of activity orders, you know, customer enthusiasm, specifically related to discretionary projects. And so that piece of information plus with the improvement and uncertain indices leading indicators relative to our business, i.e., ABI new construction starts, those types of things, which I'll remind you relative to new construction, it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be incremental business this year, but continued improvement, particularly as we look out beyond 2021. With the improvement in non-resi, you know, really relates to discretionary projects, you know are continuing to be favorable more than what we had originally anticipated. Last time, we were on the conference call, residential continues its strength really across the board. You know, just really seeing good improvement in DIY, new build construction, et cetera, we expect that strength to continue. I would just, you know, remind you, you know, keep in mind that last year as we're coming, exiting out of Q2 after the plant shutdowns, demand started to surge, we were kind of catching our feet relative to production and kind of keeping up with demand. We didn't start kind of filling channel inventory until late Q3, Q4, that will be non-recurring right this year. And so you get into a tougher comp, if you will, in the back half of this year as it relates to the residential business, but still growth on a normalized basis. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. And then my follow-up would be switching to the Americas margin outlook. So if I look in the 10-Q, you have that pricing and productivity in excess of inflation line, you know, that was only about a 20 bps tailwind to margins in the first quarter? How should we think about that playing out over the balance of the year, you know, both in terms of sort of what's happening with inflation and also your pricing measures? Patrick Shannon : It's going to be more difficult. And, you know, the reason being is the inflationary item will step up, it's going to be worse as we progress kind of throughout the course of the year. Why, because of the input costs, you know, specific to commodities and material components. The other thing I would remind you of is, remember, we talked last year about some of the boomerang effect of the cost kind of coming back in into 2021, that was not there in 2020. So that's another item, plus, you know, we're going to have incremental investments, so all those are going to weigh a little bit more on margin. And will put a, you know, more pressure, if you will, on margins in the back half of the year that, you know, for '21 that we didn't experience in 2020. But let me just add something else. I think the - on the non-resi side of things is you know, relative to the reduced volume, even though things were getting better as we progressed throughout the year, we do have volume deleverage. We have taken the necessary actions to extract variable costs, okay. So it's really a volume deleverage issue. It's not a permanent item, when volumes come back margins will accelerate and - because we've taken the necessary cost control actions. Dave Petratis : I'd add one other dimension and that would just be a slight mix shift as this - as the discretionary small project comes back and we're seeing that and applauding it, it tends to have more mid price point products versus our new build supply that's, you know, heavy in our premium products. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Colton West of Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Colton West : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. It looks like some great progress was made this quarter. I guess firstly, you know, as we speak to contacts and we hear of a pickup in non-res quoting activity and in the prepared remarks, you called out an acceleration on the R&R side. With where conditions stand today, are you able to give us a more concrete sense of when we start to see orders and then the corresponding top line growth? And this is something you know, do we start to see quotes turn into orders as early as 2Q? Or is this - does this not materialize until maybe the back half for next year? Dave Petratis : You know, we see some favorable indicators, one, the broader indicators that you all see, ABI, Dodge, you know, it's, you know, starts, not Dodge starts. But momentum. So we like what we see there too. Our own specification is up. The challenge with that is specification doesn't mean orders tomorrow or next week or even next quarter, you know, we would see that, you know, gaining momentum as we exit '21 and then into '22. I also like the, you know, where the investment is going in terms of our mix and strengths of the company, as we see end markets dynamics, you know, in major projects and in construction, hospitals, K through 12, college campuses and institutions, that's where the market is rebounding and it attends to complement the strengths of the company. Colton West : Okay. And then my next one is from sort of a 30,000 foot view. Would you consider the current level of earnings to be trough earnings? And if so, can you walk us through the moving parts that will push earnings to the next peak? Patrick Shannon : Yeah, so, you know, I would characterize, you know, the earnings, you know, really good performance, obviously in Q1. You know, if we look at the full year guide, you know, kind of in line with last year, in terms of where we ended up. You know, I would expect, you know, what the improvement in terms of our outlook, particularly on the non-residential business gaining momentum that will hopefully continue to accelerate in 2022. As I mentioned before, you would see continuous improvement in margins relative to that business, with the continuation of residential in the strength of the end markets, would expect growth there. So, yeah, I would characterize, you know, as long as the end markets continue to be favorable, you know, we'll see, you know, earnings growth, you know, accelerate, you know, from '22 and beyond. Colton West : Okay, great. That's all I had. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Yes. Good morning. Dave Petratis : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Yeah, so a question in the last stimulus bill, and I think HVAC companies had been talking about it and also electrical companies have been talking about it. There's a lot of money allocated for schools. And I think, if you look in the last stimulus, I think 70% of the money was spent on capital improvement project, right. And the money seems to be like sort of $67 billion a year for the next three years. So, you know, I think HVAC companies and electrical companies are talking about the fact that they'll see an impact from this in next quarter, right, because you do a school remodeling in the summer. So institutional vertical is quite a big deal for you guys. Are you going to see any impact from it? And what's your assessment of the impact of this portion of the stimulus on your business this year and next year? Thank you. Dave Petratis : So thanks for your question. You know we absolutely see the billions of dollars that are being allocated into K through 12's campuses. We will see benefit from that, hard to quantify each project, you know, we'll have different attributes, but it's clear, school security remains on the minds of Americans. And I think to the rise in violence, which is disturbing across the country, you know, will coupled with the stimulus, school security will get a portion of that investment and benefit Allegion. Andrew Obin : Great. But is it in your guidance here or is it just too hard to quantify at this point? Patrick Shannon : You know, I would say, Andrew, a little bit too hard to quantify at this point. However, you know, as we talked about earlier, a step up in terms of order activity relative to discretionary projects, we did see and that will turn into we'll call it, new business, you know, Q2, Q3 type of timeframe. But I think trying to kind of quantify a larger impact specific to the stimulus bill right now is probably premature. Dave Petratis : I would just add, we will capture a large percentage of that security spent and we should be able to have visibility to that in our spec and quotation activity in which we also see a very large part of the market. Andrew Obin : Got you. And just a follow-up question on international sort of starting to build impressive momentum there in terms of operating turnaround. Can you just give us more granularity you know, what's driving it? Is it Italy? Is it Poland? Is it Korea? Is it Australia? As I said, it's been all of a sudden, there's real momentum, just would love to get a better sense of what's happening there. Thank you. Dave Petratis : So, one, remember the pandemic started, you know, internationally before it started here. So you know, Asia Pacific, particularly Italy hit hard early. So we're seeing that recovery, even though the pandemic continues to move. Number two, our continued investment in electronics and software, our Interflex and SimonsVoss businesses are performing extremely well and quite proud of the work. The leverage of investment to drive top line which we will continue. Third, success in our GPS business, you know, for those of you that have gone to try and buy a bike, there's no inventory in, and we made supply chain changes that gives us some advantages versus importers. We like that. And then we're beginning to see early recovery as well, Australia, New Zealand, remember, our Gainsborough acquisition as residential recovery drives in Australia we'll do extremely well there. I'd add something else. Over the last four to five quarters, we've been working hard to reposition that. We collapsed, you know, three divisions into two that gave us some cost efficiencies, driving more accountability down and the ability to invest back in those businesses for future growth. I like our position and the future's bright as we move through recovery. Andrew Obin : Thank you. Really appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Please go ahead. Tim Wojs : Hey, everybody. Good morning. Nice work. Patrick Shannon : Thanks, Tim. Dave Petratis : Thank you, Tim. Tim Wojs : Maybe just a bigger picture question for you guys. Just as you're seeing buildings reopened where in the budget stack is security from a priority perspective? And I guess I'm just kind of wondering if you're seeing other areas within buildings like HVAC taking focus away from security? Are you seeing kind of the interest in the budget priorities, you know, relatively unchanged relative to where they were pre-COVID? Dave Petratis : I would describe it as this, and I think it's consistent as I have painted it. I think over the last 12 months, there's been absence of any type of preventive maintenance and small project work because the focus was on the health and safety of the occupants of buildings. I believe what we saw strongly, you know, beginning mid-March and continues on is the return of that, people going after those projects, those small projects preventive maintenance activity, particularly if it's security related, carry a pretty high priority versus other preventive maintenance aspects. Let's say the door doesn't show up properly, it's not locking, I have a security breach. You know, maintenance people are always making tradeoffs as we move into the air-conditioning season, where we don't have a heat, those tends to be a, you know, a red priority, we could fall into yellow. But, Tim, I believe there's an absence - there have been an absence of preventive maintenance, the small projects and those are moving in, I believe the budgets are there. I've also been refreshed that in larger projects that have - that were delayed, those are coming back, you know, in the mid price project level. An example would be the University of Tennessee, they had a project, you know, that was, you know, slated to go in '20, that's come back on. So, you know, was fully budgeted. I think, again, what that will naturally occur and we'll get our share of that wallet and as the new construction comes back, it will add more momentum to Allegion. Tim Wojs : Okay. Okay, great, that's good to hear. And then maybe just my second question, just on the M&A side of things. How would you kind of characterize the development in the pipeline over the last three months to six months? And any sort of increased, you know, kind of activity or actionability there, you know, just given you know, like more of a meeting of the minds in terms of, you know, people's perspective on the end market? Dave Petratis : I would say, the attention of the leadership team has never been stronger. You know, focused on, you know, moves that can help improve the scale of Allegion. We believe as we move harder in seamless access scale matters, we're pushing hard on moves that we think would help us participate in the connection of access, seamless access at a faster pace. I'd say less time spent on you know, smaller projects and deals. But you know, we've been working on this now for seven, eight years and we're pushing on those relationships. We believe there's further consolidation opportunities within the market. And the faster that we, you know, accelerate this convergence it's going to force some action. Tim Wojs : Okay. Okay, great. Well, good luck on the rest of year guys. Nice job. Dave Petratis : Thank you. Good to hear from you. Operator : The next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Walsh : Hi, good morning and really impressive execution in the international business. Wanted to actually ask you about where you see the margins going for that segment now? I mean, really strong out of the gate here with that kind of high end of upper single-digits performance? What should we kind of be thinking about for the full year there in terms of margins? Patrick Shannon : Yeah, John. So, you know, again, as you indicated, really strong performance, you know, both top line and you know, margin, you know, rates, particularly relative compared to prior year. Just as a reminder, you may recall last year, we were pretty quick out of the gate in terms of implementing cost control measures, you know, going in with the restructuring programs across the board, in Asia as well as Europe. And so you're seeing kind of the full benefit of that, if you will, reflected in the '21 results. So the restructuring actions taken last year begin to lap in the back half of the year. So you're not going to see kind of a step up in the margin performance that you saw in Q1. However, I would suggest that margins will continue to improve year-over-year, you know, as we continue throughout the year, and we should finish on an aggregate basis, i.e. the consolidation of Asia and Europe together, that kind of a record performance in terms of margin percent. And that's really reflective as Dave kind of highlighted earlier, the continued strength in electronics, which has a higher margin profile, the - all the cost reduction actions that we've taken will continue to manifest itself and the collapse and consolidation of the two segments together, we're seeing the benefits of that as well. I feel like we're in a really good position kind of going forward, not only to drive top line, but ensure that we do it in a profitable basis and we continue from here on out getting margin accretion as the business continues to grow. John Walsh : Great, thank you. And then just as a follow-up, I think it was in response to Julian's question about residential, you called out kind of some stock orders in Q3, Q4, just curious here in Q1, if you were still seeing those stock orders or if kind of sell in is equal to sell out at this point? Yeah. Patrick Shannon : Yeah, so we did experience some of that, not to the magnitude that we did in the latter half of last year. And I would say too, you know, quite frankly, if you kind of look at inventory levels in the channel, you know, particularly a big box like that on like a trailing kind of 12-month basis, basis of future demand, still probably lower than where it needs to be. So it's a matter of kind of, you know, trying to produce at a higher level, which is difficult right now, kind of given some of the supply constraints in our business. So there is maybe a little bit more that we could put into the channel. But you know, right now as that we're kind of assuming we're more on a normalized basis, producing, you know, basis of demand type of thing. John Walsh : Great. Appreciate taking the questions. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Dave Petratis : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Yeah, I just wanted to put my finger a little bit more on kind of the cyclical trajectory also. And I thought maybe it'd be helpful to kind of discuss things a little bit sequentially, given how wild some of the year-over-year comps are with COVID and the like. Just thinking about Americas in aggregate, right, with commercial coming off the bottom and resi still strong I mean, is there any reason to think you don't have your normal sequential lift in revenues there from Q1 to Q2? Dave Petratis : I think, you know, first, let's look at the lay of the land, you know, backwards. You know, we had the rupture of the pandemic, then let's go even back, we had a record Q1, we had the rupture of the pandemic, but as we compare to competition, I believe we were stronger, you know, quarter in, quarter out over several of the last quarter. So, you know, whether it was up or down the sequential nature of it, remember, we talked about, you know, plowing through our backlog. So with that as a backdrop, as we move through, we should expect some lift in the second and third quarters that we would normally see. I think that's why we highlight the return of the discretionary and small projects, which I think will certainly be better than it was a year ago. The but is, you know, that new construction demand is not as robust as it was going into the pandemic. So I think it takes '21 to normalize itself. And we'll see, probably a truer picture of what the markets going to be and we believe better as we go into '22. Jeff Sprague : Yeah, the nature of my question is really, you know, I hate to just kind of play math exercise with you, right. But, you know, Q2 sales typically rise 15% to 20% sequentially, right. For that to happen, you know, you need almost 30% organic growth in Q2. And if you do 30% organic growth in Q2, you know, you're implying kind of negative 10% in the back half to get to your guide. Dave Petratis : Patrick will have the math, I would suggest, and we are suggesting a forecast that's not going to happen. And I think one of the key drivers is new - non-residential construction starts, they had been down 28% for the last four quarters. And that is clearly a driver of our business that's got to be in place to get that type of ramp. Patrick Shannon : So, Jeff, keep in mind, going into Q2 last year, we're coming off a record quarter Q1 2020. Backlogs were really, really healthy both on discretionary, new construction you know, projects that were started were kind of still being completed some of them may have been delayed and pushed out during the back half of the year. So you still have a real tough comp on non-res, okay, new construction, it begins to improve year-over-year and sequentially, but by Q2 is still going to be, you know, a non-resi now, okay, non-residential, a non-resi still kind of be tough, okay. We didn't have plant shutdowns like we did in residential business in Q2. Jeff Sprague : Right, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hey, good morning, guys. Dave Petratis : Good morning, Josh. Patrick Shannon : Hi, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Dave, just on a bit of a snap the line update versus where you were in kind of three months or six months ago. I think the expectation was that when we get into the second half, folks will be back in, you know, some of these institutions or offices and will drive some retrofit activity. It sounds like some of that is starting to percolate a bit quicker. But I guess one, am I reading that right? And two, is that something that could show up as soon as 2Q? I know, there's still plenty of chop in the new side of the market, but you know just versus that prior expectation of a second half improvement in non-resi retrofit. Dave Petratis : I want to be very clear. Beginning mid-March and through today, we saw an uplift in wholesale and CHD demand that we believe is part of you know, an air pocket that we saw 12 months earlier, preventive maintenance, small projects were delayed. And that's come back and we're very pleased to see that. It was a little earlier, I think the results of the vaccination success we're having here in the US has driven that and overall confidence. So you know, feel good about that. We added to Allegion's commercial - or commercial and institutional backlog in the Americas during the period. And we continue to believe that will - that demand will continue. I think the challenge is that new construction backlog which you know, the projects are complete, I think it's evident in the starts data that comes out of Dodge, and we just got to work through that. I think we've got a reasonable view on it. Again, market demand was better than we anticipated in Q1, reasonably better, it's still softer than it was a year ago. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful and maybe that just to follow-up on that. And I think this sort of gets to what Jeff was asking as well. I get the - there's still plenty of uncertainty on new construction. And you just sort of prefaced that with your answer just now that the non-res new backlog is still lower. But, is it lower than what you would have thought a few months ago? I guess that would sort of imply some higher level of conversion. So I guess that's always possible. But it sounds like the market itself is doing better from an orders' perspective just trying to balance that, you know, maybe heightened caution on the back on comment even though I don't know if anything's really changed for you. Dave Petratis : I would say you know, the new construction activity is, you know, performing as we would anticipate and we see the benefits of that really rolling in into '22. And it's the nature of the beast. I would also emphasize this. However the market performs, on the retrofits small project and new construction, I believe that we've made the investments here that will continue to beat the market. Josh Pokrzywinski : Great. That's helpful color and congrats on a good quarter. Dave Petratis : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Please go ahead. Chris Snyder : Thank you. Just following-up a little bit more on the non-res comments. If starts inflect to positive here shortly when could we expect the new construction business to bottom? And then just any color you could provide on the R&R trajectory embedded in the 2021 guidance? Dave Petratis : I would say, if starts inflect and we believe they'll gain momentum as we go through the year you really see the benefits of that in '22, because dirt in the ground today does not mean revenues for Allegion tomorrow, this is a long cycle nature, most building projects that, you know, have a 12 month to 18-month duration, especially in our sweet spots. And that's how I'd paint it. I'm extremely encouraged by the uplift of our specification activity and the broader indices. And I think, coupled that with the stimulus, you know, we feel good about where this business is going. Chris Snyder : Appreciate that - all that color. And then, you know, just kind of following up. So non-res has been running at a low double-digit or down low double-digits for the last three quarters. Can you provide any color on the under the surface movements between new construction, which kind of based on your last comment seems like it would be continually getting worse through at least Q1, and just, you know, any mix there between new construction or just the under the surface movements? Patrick Shannon : As you know, we don't really give specific guidance associated with a breakdown in those, you know, kind of end markets, but, you know, I would, you know, characterize it this way that, you know, continued, you know, pressure as we kind of continue to go through '21, relative to new construction, year-over-year, but getting sequentially better in the back half of the year, i.e. as we progress, the rate of decline becomes less. The repair and retrofit was the first area that kind of saw the decline, you know, last year and that will start to hopefully improve in the back half of the year, you know, year-over-year, but keep in mind, the new construction part of our non-residential business is roughly 65% relative to or compared to the discretionary total. Dave Petratis : I would also - Chris Snyder : Appreciate that - Dave Petratis : \u2026suggest you know, just a little bit more color on that. The range of capabilities that Allegion has today, opening price point, mid price point and full price point in terms of our commercial and institution offerings is it\u2019s significantly better than it was in the last downturn. We're seeing that growth, we're flexing, you know, our strength in the channel to make sure if the dollar\u2019s available for revenue, that we get more than our fair share of that. Chris Snyder : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead. Ryan Merkel : Hey, everyone. First off, can you just talk about the supply chain pressures you're seeing? And is this risk manageable? Or are you expecting to see a revenue impact in '21? Dave Petratis : So, you know, our record speaks for itself here, I think the Allegion's supply chain has performed exceptionally you know, through the last five quarters. You know, it's because of this, you know, strategic choice that we make to produce, you know, in region and it's benefiting us in a lot of ways. There are clear and obvious pressures, particularly on electronics and we're certainly adapting to those. You know, there could be, you know, some shutdowns in terms of we're not able to produce specific products. With that in mind, we were very aggressive early to put in long-term orders to secure our supply chains, we've got tight, vendor relations. And again, my confidence is, yes, we can be affected, but we will navigate it better than the competition. Patrick Shannon : And I would add that, you know, the current guide assumes that we're going to help mitigate the impact of the inefficiencies. You know, I feel good about that, where we stand today. However, you know, continued pressure there does create inefficiencies, you know, to the extent, you know, we're unable to procure the appropriate supplies needed to produce the products. And so kind of remains to be seen, but we're managing through it. Some of our product lines, you know particularly electronics are hand to mouth and it does create, you know, inefficiencies, but we're working through those issues. Ryan Merkel : That's helpful - Dave Petratis : I would also, you know - 40 years of dealing with this type of thing we made moves early, you know, that will help us. And we're extremely proud of our supply team. And you know, what they've done to mitigate a variety of issues and we were well out ahead of this, and I think we'll come out of it stronger. Ryan Merkel : Got it. All right and then just quickly, you know, great to hear the non-res rentals coming back. Is that a broad-based comment? Or is it just happening in certain sectors today? Dave Petratis : So, you know, I think if you go across the geographies, you know, we see stronger activity, particularly in the South, East Texas, you can kind of look at where COVID\u2019s come, you know, had harder hits or, you know, where shutdowns have been harder, you know, it reflects the strength as you go into the different segments, think about, were you completing your preventive maintenance list at any hospital in the United States over the last, you know, 15 months? I would suggest the answer is no. College campuses are similar and we see confidence in our wholesale distribution orders, incoming orders. And it's going into those segments that have really been, you know, battered in their ability just to, you know, meet the needs of their customers. Ryan Merkel : Perfect, thanks. Dave Petratis : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital. Please go ahead. Jeff Kessler : Thank you and thank you for taking the question. First, just quickly on international, again, congratulations on the numbers. You've explained them. I'd love to give Tim all the credit. But of course, I won't yet. But I do want to know, what his game plan is or what the game plan is for getting what in general for getting in International, essentially moving so that the - so that currency and other factors are not what we're going to be talking about in two or three years. But the - but gains in market share, et cetera. Because obviously, having international move forward is just another quiver in your growth cap. Dave Petratis : So, you know, Tim does have a lot of instant talent. And, you know, we give him you know, great kudos in the first 90 days. Jeff, there - there's been a tremendous amount of work that's gone on in that business over the last couple of years. And one is, you know, I talked about the restructuring, significant investment in prioritization around Interflex and SimonsVoss really nice growth over the last six quarters, the Interflex and SimonsVoss performed exceptionally during the pandemic, and I think that momentum will continue. As you think about strategic priorities for Tim, it's to continue that growth and expand the cloud and technical capabilities. You know better than others that SimonsVoss really thrives on what we call active technologies. Driving more investment that goes into some of the passive areas will help fuel those - their growth which could include also acquisition. But we like that SimonsVoss Interflex. I think, second important for Tim, is, we acquired the Gainsborough asset, that's well positioned. We launched the first electronic tri-lock in the region. And we think we're well positioned to be with new - in the newbuild and the DIY to see nice growth as that residential market recovers in Gainsborough. I think third what has been surprising to Tim in his first 90 days, is the opportunity to export more capability from the Americas which he has more knowledge than anybody in the company, and you know, so looking forward to taking some of the real strengths we have here in the Americas and helping our international partners grow even faster. Jeff Kessler : Okay. My follow-up question quickly is and maybe the answer may not be so quick, is, just underneath your level, I would say we're perhaps down level from where you folks operate, we're seeing a shift, some - a small shift in growth from away from video and toward we'll call it, you want to call it software-based access control, everything from obviously NFC to Bluetooth to ultrahigh frequency as well as, you know, as - just as well as the just power, you know, Power over Ethernet, which you folks know a little bit about. And what we're also seeing - is simply put a gain in software as the driver as opposed to hardware as a driver in getting into access control. And with access control, let's say becoming a faster growth area than even video, and we've seen some crazy valuations in the venture and private equity markets for some of these companies that are getting involved in areas that are either adjacent to you or actually may compete with you from intercoms all the way to you know to SaaS-based things. What is the company looking at in terms of, you know, trying to make sure that both protects its flank and grow this business? Dave Petratis : So, I would describe it as one of the most exciting opportunities that I've seen in you know my 40 years of industrial participation. The company has been invested heavily and increased our investment as we went through the pandemic, you know, the, Yonomi acquisition would be reflective. But if you looked under the covers and saw the growth of our investments in Bangalore and our engineering capabilities, since I created - since we created Allegion, we tripled the feet on the street there to be able to position ourselves more strongly in the connectivity and the software elements. Third, Jeff, would be the venture activity you know, and you see some of the investments Kasa, Mint House, Openpath, I don't believe we - our strategy has been to be in the fast lanes to you know with new technology to be observe, learn, partner, invest potentially own, Yonomi went through that entire cycle. I think we continue to sharpen our position and I like our opportunities to be able to participate in the world of seamless access that you described. Jeff Kessler : All right, great. Look forward to interacting with you guys in the future. Thank you. Dave Petratis : We're always a leader in this and we appreciate your thought leadership, Jeff. Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Martineau for any closing remarks. Tom Martineau : We'd like to thank everybody for participating in today's call and have a safe day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Allegion delivered a very strong quarter. And I would like to thank the employees of Allegion for their contributions and efforts. Our employees are the greatest strength of Allegion, their dedication to safety and customer excellence is outstanding, and our teams have moved quickly to adapt to opportunities in a dynamic market. Before I jump into the financials, I want to give you a high-level update on recovery trends in the business overall. The pandemic has changed our world and created volatility throughout the last 18 months, both in terms of the economic contraction last year and the current economic rebound we are seeing.  Starting in Q1 and accelerating in Q2, demand surged faster and stronger than expected. This is a positive sign and provides confidence in the sustainable economic recovery. In fact, Allegion is already returning to pre-pandemic demand levels. At the same time, the robust demand is constraining the global supply chain\u2019s ability to fully meet the poll for labor and materials, especially electronic components.  Allegion has built a record non-residential backlog in 2021, which is a healthy sign of strong demand. And we believe Allegion will be well positioned for the remainder of this year, and for 2022. And another positive sign to recovery are America\u2019s electronics grew more than 20% in the second quarter. There was strong demand for electronic residential products and in the non-residential retrofit, repair and small project opportunities. Allegion is not immune to inflation and the supply chain constraints impacting the industrial markets. Allegion navigated well during Q2, but these industry-wide constraints will persist for the remainder of the year, and put pressure on margins for the short term. We will leverage the strength of our supply chain management capabilities as well as price to mitigate these impacts.  During the pandemic, we were also able to restructure the business and make it leaner, while keeping our front facing and strategic investments. Allegion is stronger exiting the pandemic than when we entered it. Now let's turn to the second quarter performance for more details. Please go to Slide 5. I'm pleased with the company's second quarter results. We delivered strong performance in all areas. Revenue for the second quarter was 746.9 million, an increase of 26.7% or 23.8% organically. The organic revenue increase was driven by the favorable comparable created by last year\u2019s shutdowns, solid price realization from the price increase announced earlier this year, and the increased market demand which returned to pre-pandemic levels. Currency tailwinds provided a boost to total revenue and more than offset the impact of divestitures.  Adjusted operating margin increased by 70 basis points in the second quarter. The restructuring and cost management actions taken during 2020 along with volume leverage have offset the accelerated inflation. We are also seeing cost creep back from reductions experienced last year during the pandemic. Mix is also a margin headwind due to our strong residential growth.  Adjusted earnings per share of $1.32 increased $0.40, or 43.5% versus the prior year. The increase was driven largely by the expanded operating income, with some benefits also coming from a favorable tax rate and share count. Year-to-date available cash flow came in at 249.6 million, an increase of 146 million versus the prior year. The increased cash flow was driven by higher net earnings along with improvements in net working capital and reduced capital expenditures. Please go to Slide 6. Last quarter, I shared with you Allegion\u2019s build-borrow-buy approach to accelerating seamless access. Today, I want to briefly focus on the borrow innovation engine in our strategic pillar to be the partner of choice. Allegion participates in recognized, secure, industry-leading platforms. We expand our reach through strategic relationships with recognized experts and tech innovators, and we leverage open standards. By doing this, we not only set up Allegion as the partner of choice and a continued leader in the IoT marketplace. We also ensure Allegion has its choice of strategic partners as well. Allegion has a growing breadth of strategic partners; mega-tech, software product integrators, our venture portfolio, and technology alliance and industry consortium. We are executing on our partnership strategic pillar and here are a few recent examples. Allegion was showcased at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference. We're expanding our innovation with Apple in both residential and commercial marketplaces. In the smart home space, Schlage will soon be growing its connected portfolio with a new device that allows people to easily and securely unlock their doors with just a tap using home keys for the icon or the Apple Watch.  At the same time, we are extending our work with student ID in the Apple Wallet to offer more access control options to universities and colleges, enterprises and their students plus employees. Allegion renewed our engagement with the Matter Work Group, a mega-tech consortium. Through this partnership, we're working to establish a secure connectivity standard for the future of the smart home that will ultimately allow more seamless connections between more IoT devices. We announced Allegion\u2019s venture investments in both Mint House and Mapped, two startups driving new value in a post COVID world through revolutionary experiences and technology. And we completed a brand new cloud-to-cloud integration with Openpath, leveraging our engaged technology, then Schlage NDE and the LE mobile-enabled smart locks. Through these partnerships, we're investing in promising innovation. We're leveraging developer friendly APIs and open standards.  Allegion is building strategic, commercial and technical relationships. We are collaborating with recognized experts who also understand and embrace how Allegion creates value by securing people and assets with seamless access wherever they reside, work and thrive.  Patrick will now take you through the financial results. And I'll be back to discuss our revised '21 outlook and to wrap up. Patrick Shannon : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to Slide 7. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter 2020, reported earnings per share was $0.80. Adjusting $0.12 for charges related to restructuring expenses, the 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $0.92. Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.36 driven by volume leverage, along with continued benefits from cost control measures and restructuring actions taken in 2020. Favorable price and currency also contributed to the increase. The combination of these items offset headwinds from inflation, bounce back variable costs related to reduce volume from the COVID-19 pandemic and unfavorable mix.  Favorable tax rate drove a $0.06 increase in earnings per share. Divestitures had a positive $0.01 per share impact and offset the impact of other income and interest expense. Investment spend increased during the quarter and reduced earnings per share by $0.05. As a reminder, the incremental investment spend is predominantly related to R&D, technology and market investments to accelerate future growth. This results in adjusted second quarter 2021 earnings per share of $1.32, an increase of $0.40 or 43.5% compared to the prior year.  Lastly, we had a $0.01 per share reduction related to restructuring charges and acquisition integration expenses. After giving effect to these items, you arrive at the second quarter 2021 reported earnings per share of $1.31.  Please go to Slide 8. This slide depicts the components of our revenue performance for the second quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides.  As indicated, we experienced organic revenue growth of 23.8% in the second quarter, as higher demand and a favorable comparable drove significant volume increases versus the prior year. We also experienced solid price performance coming in over 2%, which is up sequentially. Currency continued to be a tailwind to total growth and more than offset the impact of divestitures. In total, reported revenue came in at 26.7% growth.  Please go to Slide 9. Second quarter revenues for the Allegion Americas segment were 549.4 million, up 23.7% on a reported basis and 22.9% organically. While the strong growth reflects the impact of COVID-related shutdowns last year, it is also the result of accelerated market demand. The region continued to deliver good price realization. On volume, Americas non-residential experienced high-single digit growth driven by retrofit, repair and small projects. Americas residential was outstanding again experiencing growth of more than 70%. The significant growth from the prior year was primarily due to facility closures in 2020. However, we continue to see strength and retail point of sale in new home construction.  While our products revenue was up high 20%, we experienced electronics growth in both the non-residential and residential businesses. Electronics and touchless solutions will continue to be long-term growth drivers. The accelerated demand coupled with labor and parts shortages, especially in electronic components, is resulting in elevated backlogs as we enter the third quarter, particularly in non-residential. The timing of when we see the revenue could shift as the industry works through the supply chain constraints.  Americas adjusted operating income of 150.5 million increased 21.3% versus the prior year period, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter was down 50 basis points. The decrease was driven by headwinds related to inflation, bounce back costs and unfavorable mix more than offsetting the volume leverage. While the price productivity inflation dynamic was slightly positive on a dollar basis, it did have a 60-basis point dilutive impact on adjusted margins, as did the incremental investment spend.  Please go to Slide 10. Second quarter revenues for the Allegion International segment were 197.5 million, up 36% and up 26.6% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven predominantly by strength across all European countries and businesses, as markets continue to rebound. Part of the year-over-year growth was due to the comparative impact of COVID-related shutdowns in the prior year. Favorable currency impacts also contributed to total revenue growth and were slightly offset by divestiture impacts. International adjusted operating income of 18.5 million increased more than 18 million versus the prior year period.  Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased by 920 basis points. The margin increase was driven primarily by solid volume leverage, benefits from lower operating costs due to the restructuring and cost control actions taken during 2020, as well as favorable currency impacts. All of these offset the higher inflation and bounce back costs which had 150 basis point impact and incremental investments, which were a 20 basis point headwind. Please go to Slide 11. Year-to-date available cash flow for the second quarter of 2021 came in at 249.6 million, which is an increase of 146 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by higher earnings, improvements in net working capital and reduced capital expenditures. Our cash flow generation continues to be a strong asset for the company.  Looking at the chart to the right, it shows working capital as a percent of revenues decreased based on a 4 point quarter average. This was driven by improved asset turnover in both receivables and inventory. The business continues to generate strong cash flow and is well positioned to deliver 500 million in available cash flow for the year.  I'll now hand it back over to Dave for an update for our full year 2021 outlook. Dave Petratis : Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide 12. At the end of Q2, leading indicators continue to be positive. I\u2019m increasingly optimistic on the economic recovery. The Americas residential business continues to be high.  On the non-residential side of Americas, demand accelerated for retrofit, repair and small projects, and is recovering in new construction. However, labor and part charges are proving to be challenging, and we are building a strong backlog that will benefit us in the future. With these parameters in place, we are raising our outlook for total revenue in the Americas to be at 4.5% to 5% and organic revenue to be up 4% to 4.5% in 2021. In the Allegion International segment, markets continue to recover led by our Germanic and Global Portable Security businesses. Currency tailwinds more than offset the divestiture of our QMI door business and contribute to total growth.  For that region, we are raising our outlook for total revenue growth to 13.5% to 14.5% with organic growth of 8.5% to 9.5%. All-in for total Allegion, we are now projecting total revenue to be up 7% to 7.5% and organic revenue to increase to 5.5% to 6%. We are also raising our earnings per share outlook with reported EPS at a range of $5.15 to $5.30 and adjusted EPS to be between $5.25 and $5.40.  This guide incorporates pricing actions to mitigate the expected impact of direct material inflation. We anticipate these inflationary challenges will persist for the balance of the year, and we will continue to monitor and adapt to changing market conditions.  Our outlook for available capital is also being raised and is now projected to be 490 million to 510 million. The outlook assumes investment spend of approximately $0.20 per share. The full adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 12%. The outlook for outstanding diluted shares continues to be approximately 91 million shares. Please go to Slide 13. Allegion continues its great start in 2021. We have managed the business extremely well and leading indicators of specific market indices related to our business continue to be positive. Looking forward, we are prepared to navigate the pressures related to accelerated inflation in labor and part shortages. We are encouraged by the positive resiliency of our supply chain, and we will continue to manage these challenges for the balance of the year.  Thank you. Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning, guys. Dave Petratis : Good morning, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : So I guess first question on the margin front. Obviously, there's kind of the tyranny of the math on price costs, even though you're positive on the dollar basis. And I would imagine a little bit of a mix headwind on the revenue side as well. But if you just kind of take a giant step back and put some of the mechanical items aside, do you feel like getting price or managing inflation and logistics and all the other kind of inflationary headwinds, labor is any different than it has been normally, or that has got gotten a little bit more challenging? It\u2019s sort of hard to parse through some of the different moving pieces there. Dave Petratis : Yes, I would characterize it this way. And you're right. There's a lot of tyranny in the math. But what we've seen is an acceleration of inflation, predominantly in commodity costs, material components, freight packaging, et cetera. It\u2019s continued to be a headwind. As you know, we're pretty aggressive moving on price. And we're taking similar actions in the back half of this year. We went ahead and announced a price increase that will take effect at the beginning of Q4. So there's going to be some margin pressure, I would say, given the acceleration in inflation, particularly in Q3. I expect price to offset material inflation. The issue is really in some of the other components as it relates to packaging, freight, those type of things, will drive productivity to help mitigate those type of things, like we have previously. But it's going to be a challenge. There will be some margin pressure in the back half of the year. But I feel very confident relative to margin improvement as we go into 2022, predominantly because of the carryover price. And we'll continue to take pricing actions next year. We'll have an improved mix profile, as it relates to the non-residential business growing faster and accelerating more so than the residential business. And we're not going to have these bounce back costs, which were an issue for us in Q2, and will kind of linger during Q3, Q4 this year. So I think to answer your question, Josh, we\u2019ll continue to manage the business. We'll get through some of the supply chain challenges. That in of itself also put a little bit of margin pressure because of some of the inefficiencies at the factories. But we'll manage through it. Margin sequentially will improve in the second half relative to the first half, still down year-over-year. But then in 2022, expect margin improvement to accelerate. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess just a follow up on the comment, Dave, you made on record backlog. Maybe if you could unpack that a little, because I would imagine some of that is resi where you probably don't really want a lot of backlog there and it's more indicative of lead times and supply chain stuff than it is necessarily like a long cycle business. So maybe break down the components of that of how much is non-resi, is the market getting better and reopening and retrofit versus we're just hearing more backlog in resi because the whole supply chain lengthens? Thanks. Dave Petratis : So, I want to be clear. The backlog issue is not a residential problem. Our residential backlog is slightly above what we normally run. The backlog creation has been on the commercial side of the business and the rapid build has really happened over the last 60 to 90 days. The commercial backlog predominantly on the Americas business is double normal. And it was really driven by the acceleration of order demand that we started seeing in April. And I\u2019ll give you some backdrop here. If you go back December, January, February, March, and we would have talked about this in the Q1 call, commercial institutional demand in the Americas business was down low double digits, and it's like someone turned on a light. And it's -- extremely pleased with that demand acceleration. We're doing a good job of I think processing that through, but there's supply constraints and it's resulted in a record backlog that I think we'll continue to see. There's been analysts out there that have said, we've done a better job of managing this. And I believe that to be true. Our supply chain is strong and we're going to benefit from that trend. I'd also share one other comment is the macroeconomic forecast on what I'd say the commercial break fix was not particularly clear. In fact, I've got economic reports that would suggest that the repair, replacement would have been soft even today. That switch came back on. We've gained that opportunity. So why couldn't we have seen it? When you shut off access to college campuses, hospitals and commercial buildings for 400 days, you get pent-up demand and that's what we're seeing reacting positively in the marketplace. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it, very helpful. Thanks, guys. Dave Petratis : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Please go ahead. Chris Snyder : Good morning, guys. Thank you. And I kind of want to follow up on the margin commentary, but maybe from a bit of a different angle. So guidance implies a pretty material ramp in margins into the back half of 2021. My back of the envelope math puts margins in the low 21% range -- low to mid 19% in the first half. Can you just kind of help unpack the drivers of this step higher? Because guidance is not implying much volume leverage into the back half. So is this more price catching up the cost, freight normalizing, mix normalizing, any color on that step higher into the back half will be appreciated? Dave Petratis : Yes, so that trend is not uncharacteristic. From a seasonality perspective, margins -- if you kind of look at it over historical time period, stronger back half of the year. So that's not unusual. I think as we characterize sequentially, margins are expected to increase. It's the year-over-year comparisons that we would expect some degradation, just kind of given some of the things we outlined relative to inflation. Chris Snyder : I appreciate that. And then I guess following up also on the record backlogs, it sounds like revenue on some level was constrained just by the supply chain issues that everyone is feeling. And it also sounds like the back half or the full year of growth guidance is also reflecting uncertainty as to when these backlogs will be released, whether it's the back half of '21 or into '22. Could you provide any color on maybe how much or how significant revenues were maybe constrained in the quarter just because of those supply chain issues? And then how we should -- what level of maybe supply chain conservatism is baked into the full year organic growth guidance? Dave Petratis : When we look at the demand relative to what we could ship, there is going to be a disconnect there just kind of given the supply chain constraints. And I think you're aware, Chris, we normally carry a light backlog, highly specified engineered product, quick turnover in our manufacturing facilities to the customer. That has been elevated kind of given some of the constraints. But to answer your question, specifically, it could be 1%, 1.5% kind of total revenue at Allegion that's constrained that we\u2019ll get the revenue. So it's not a question of -- it's just a question of timing. So we look at it as a timing kind of transitory issue. And if the supply chain constraints persist, we'll get that in 2022, which means revenue in '22 would be accelerated more so than the overall market demand. Chris Snyder : Thank you for that. Patrick Shannon : I would add a couple other comments. Clearly, supply constraints ended the rapid acceleration of demand that we saw helped build backlogs. I would say, we will -- over this entire pandemic and downturn, the resiliency of the Allegion supply chain I believe was stronger than the competition. And we're going to come out of this better. So feel good about that. I think the other thing you've got to think about, we're not alone in this. In the retrofit community and new construction, the entire project is affected by this. And we just got to navigate in that environment. Chris Snyder : I appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Ruttenbur of Imperial Capital. Please go ahead. Brian Ruttenbur : Yes. Thank you very much. So I have two questions. Can you talk about the commercial office performance in the quarter? How much was the sector down year-over-year? How much did commercial office represent in terms of revenue in the quarter? I'm just trying to get a data point where you are. Dave Petratis : Yes, so we don't really provide revenue by vertical markets. But I would just say, in terms of market demand, i.e. order intake activity, what we're seeing in specification, et cetera, commercial office space is lagging institutional segment. And a lot of that is just not kind of keeping pace with what we're seeing in terms of the rebound in repair, retrofit and new construction. So hopefully that provides you with ample color there. Patrick Shannon : Maybe to give you a little bit more, again, we don't split out that commercial segment as a standalone, but the strength that we saw in the first half was really driven by strong wholesale, small project and retrofit business. Where that business ends up, we don't have precise data on but there's -- the snapback of that volume would say, even in the commercial office space, there's definitely going in there to repurpose, to reposition and I like the opportunity for Allegion as we move through there from an electronic standpoint. You go back six months ago, I was concerned about the return to office and we're going to have a lot of vacancies out there. Capital will go in and redefine that space, and it's going to be good for our industry. Brian Ruttenbur : Great. Well, thank you. The second question I have just coming off of ISC West and meeting with a lot of companies, private and public, we see a lot of competition coming at access control with a total solution, white and -- one of the trends I'm seeing is white labeling of hardware at a discount and integrating software. So it's all about delivering a total solution, the hardware, maybe name doesn't mean as much. That's what I'm hearing at least. So some of these companies that are investing large sums of money in this total access control solution, that's what we're seeing. Can you address what you're seeing in the industry and how you're addressing this threat? Dave Petratis : I think in today's presentation, we try to emphasize our build-borrow-buy emphasis and our partnerships with the mega-techs. I certainly see this private labeling, white labeling phenomena. I would just suggest the core part of our business has a level of complexity and connectivity that I'll bet on over the long haul. When you get into a complex business or a complex event space, like you were at ISC West, it's easy to look at this and say, okay, I can have a small offering of white label products. But when you start adding code requirements, master key systems, the connectivity with an Apple, a Google, a Lenel, the game gets a lot tougher. Brian Ruttenbur : Great. Well, thank you very much for addressing those. I really appreciate it. I'll get back. Dave Petratis : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to circle back to the Americas revenue guide for the year. You're embedding I think maybe very low-single digit growth year-on-year in the second half in the Americas. Just trying to understand what's embedded in that for residential versus non-residential and what sort of pace of slowdown of residential growth you\u2019re assuming? Dave Petratis : Yes. So, Julian, just as a reminder, last year as we're coming out of the pandemic and demand started to surge for replacement demand on residential products, backlog accelerated, channel inventories were depleted. And so a lot of the revenue growth last year was channel fill; big box retail, e-commerce, et cetera. So you're getting a tough comp, particularly in the second half as it relates to the residential business. And so that's going to impact the comparability, particularly when you're looking at overall Allegion Americas business. As we indicated, non-residential business, starting to show good demand, a little bit constrained relative to the supply chain issues, but we'll start seeing some growth kind of year-over-year. So, it's really that the guide, you have to take into account last year, had a higher growth component associated with channel fill related to the residential business. Julian Mitchell : Sure. But I guess I\u2019m trying to understand, are you assuming that residential revenues are down year-on-year in the second half or -- Dave Petratis : No. They're still increasing. Julian Mitchell : Okay, got it. That's just what I wanted to check. Thank you. And then on the margin front, looking at -- yes, we keep attacking it different ways. But let's look at it sort of second half margin year-on-year, because I think that makes more sense in terms of the information you provide in the 10-Q and so on. So it looks like your second half operating margins firm-wide maybe down something like 100, 200 bips year-on-year in the second half. Is the way to think about that it's about 200 bips headwind from inflation net of price productivity, and then maybe another 100 bips headwind from investment spend? Are those roughly the right orders of magnitude? Dave Petratis : Yes. And I would -- just a little bit more color on the price productivity inflation dynamic. Included in that guide would include some of the effect of these bounce back costs that we've been highlighting. It was much more pronounced in Q2, but you've got kind of some of those costs that continue in Q3, Q4. So that's some of the pressure as well year-over-year. Julian Mitchell : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Joseph Nolan : Hi. This is Joe Nolan on for David MacGregor. Dave Petratis : Good morning, Joe. Joseph Nolan : Good morning. I was just wondering could you talk about field inventory levels in both the residential and infomercial business. And then just how you expect the timing of the channel restock to play out? Dave Petratis : On the residential side, big box, our res pro [ph] partners, I think the restocking of that supply chain is essentially complete. There is pressure on any type of electronic-related product, again, which we\u2019re navigating well, but that will be a problem that moves through in the next four quarters. On the commercial wholesale side, as I talked about, the bounce back in demand, I think part of that is wholesalers seeing the confidence in the marketplace and restocking, but I think much of it is going straight through because of the availability or really green light on small projects that were delayed over a continued period. So I would suggest that the restocking of the wholesale and contract supply chain will be completed over the next two to three quarters. Joseph Nolan : Okay. Thanks for that. And then also just on your education business, given the year-ago pull forward and the timing of seasonal maintenance into 2Q '20. Was that a growth headwind that you experienced in 2Q '21 this year, and do you think that becomes a tailwind here in 3Q? Dave Petratis : State your question again. You broke up. Joseph Nolan : I\u2019m sorry. Just on the education business, given the year-ago pull forward and the timing of seasonal maintenance into 2Q '20. Was that a growth headwind this year in 2Q '21? And does that become a tailwind here in the third quarter? Dave Petratis : I would look at the opportunity in K-12 as part of the bounce back, but more a positive as we move into '22 and '23. Americas going to continue to invest in its K-12 infrastructure for a variety of reasons; age, increased security, more automation, and Allegion will benefit from that. It's clearly a positive. Joseph Nolan : Okay. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Hi, guys. Good morning. Dave Petratis : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : For a while, I thought I would have to use the word unpack in my question. I was wondering if there was a memo that went out to use the term unpack, but -- Dave Petratis : I thought you were going to remind me that you had it right on this bounce back. Andrew Obin : I'll take that too. Thank you. I guess the question is on pricing. Historically, your pricing has been fairly close to that of your large competitor in North America. This quarter, they seem to be ahead of you. And I was just wondering, is there a difference in approach to channel between the two of you or it\u2019s just a matter of timing, as I said, because the industry seems to sort of move in lockstep? Dave Petratis : I wouldn't say, they're ahead of us. My words to our leaders worldwide is use all tools required to address the extraordinary inflationary forces. We were out with a normal Q1 price increase. We've added surcharges on certain products. And we've announced an end of Q3 price increase, two price increases in a year and the other tools that we're using to mitigate price. I think the industry has been disciplined in our stewardship of making sure that we respond to the incredible inflationary forces that work for us. Andrew Obin : Got you. Thank you. Then the second question, as you -- and I think I've asked this question a couple of times. But as you face supply chain constraints, are you rethinking either your approach to your internal supply chain, i.e., sort of more automation, or are you sort of rethinking sourcing any long-term impact from sort of current disruption in the channel, or you think once we sort of get rid of the bullwhip effect, things go back to normal fairly fast? Dave Petratis : I think the weakened supply chain is always a strategic item, as we think about positioning the business, one. Number two, I point to our decrementals during the downturn. Our decrementals on a top line basis was softer than any of the competition, meaning as the markets collapsed, our revenues were stronger on those decrementals, and I would point to supply chain. Third is, I think clearly a lot of work going on, I'd say, managing the complexity of what we do. It's everything from boards to grommets to casting. Part of what the Allegion franchise is built on is managing this complexity. Our supply chain does an important part of -- it plays a critical part of that, but it's rethinking those partnerships, making sure that we've got the availability of any type of part to be able to move it. We've made some pretty significant industrial investments in automation. Those will continue. I think as we go through this, labor availability is going to be in scarcity on a worldwide basis. And so automation investments, investing with strong suppliers and producing in region are key drivers for Allegion, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Okay. Thank you so much. And I appreciate the compliment. I don't get those often. Thank you. Dave Petratis : I should have read that twice. I did read it twice. Operator : The next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, guys. And no need to fish for compliments on this one. Just a quick question here on the margins. If I take a look at the Americas margins and your commentary around pricing for 4Q, I guess when we think about the sequential change in margins in the Americas, is there kind of like embedded in your expectations that sequentially margins potentially step down in 3Q because of these inflationary pressures and then back up in 4Q? Just trying to understand the cadence a little bit better? Dave Petratis : Yes. So you got it right. Q3 margin decrease year-over-year much more pronounced than Q4. Q4, because of the price increase and some further actions, is still down but improving. Not as far down as 2Q. Joe Ritchie : Okay, all right. That's super helpful. And then I guess maybe just one -- maybe one broader question. I know that you guys consistently get compared to your European peer and the U.S. But if we took a step back and just thought about the industry as a whole and the potential consolidation in the locks market in the U.S., do you guys view the market as being fairly well concentrated today? Are there opportunities to continue to expand either via M&A within the market, you see future consolidation? Just curious on your broader thoughts there? Dave Petratis : I think over the last decade, this is an industry that's consolidated. I would suggest that that's not moved at the pace that other industries have. So there's opportunities, half step adjacencies. I think the brightest growth aspect for Allegion is in the seamless access technologies. Part of the corporate spend this year is we're investing to try and better understand the future of seamless access, and where it could be 5 to 10 years out, because of our unique position in. And my message here, the industry is going to continue to consolidate it, but I believe through innovation of our unique position on the door, electronics, your edge device that it will continue to drive nice growth for Allegion. Joe Ritchie : Okay, that's helpful, Dave. Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Please go ahead. Tim Wojs : Hi, guys. Good morning. Dave Petratis : Good morning to you. Tim Wojs : Maybe just -- so first question is on investment, and I guess it's two-part. So I guess first, could you just elaborate a little more on where you're making the actual incremental investments this year? And then secondly, could you just talk about the pipeline build for future investments and how the paybacks on those are kind of prospectively versus just history? Are they the kind of same, better or worse? Just kind of curious there? Patrick Shannon : Yes, Tim. So the majority of the incremental investments would be centered around R&D technology type of investments centered around driving electronics, revenue growth and market segmentation, i.e., where are the opportunities where we can expand our business and leverage our franchise globally. And so think about that in relation to some of the things Dave talked about in terms of enhancing our partnerships, to have broader connectivity into electronic seamless access, ecosystems and solutions, very important for the business going forward. So we're putting monies in those that I think will position us extremely well for growth going forward and will help us continue to grow faster than the broader market is the plan there. Your question on ROIC, it's always been a really good payback, not only on investment, but on a cash-on-cash basis, and good things to do that will position us in the marketplace for further growth. And historically, you've kind of seen our revenue kind of trend probably a little bit north of our peer set, and would expect that to kind of continue given the level of investments that we're making and position our franchise going forward. Dave Petratis : I'd build on that a bit, Tim, to say we've had -- take out the pandemic, we've had five, six years of double digit electronics growth. And clearly the market is moving that way. We've got over the next 24 months a nice pipeline of connected products coming out that it will enhance specific investments in software capabilities, what I call software stacks, that enhance the partnership that we talked about today. You have to have the APIs, SDKs that allow our locks to work in our own ecosystems and work in the complex ecosystems that may be present at a hospital, college campus. We believe this differentiates us versus one horse ponies that come in with a solution in an important part of our future growth. I'd add one other is segmenting the market and understanding the future 5, 10 years out in multifamily, K-12, college campuses and hospitals, we think we have an important role to play in our installed base in this connected environment will leverage Allegion\u2019s growth. Patrick Shannon : Tim, also just think about the movement in technology, how fast things are changing. And being part of a broader ecosystem where we can, our products can seamlessly plug and play into a broader set of solutions is very important, and so incremental investments will continue. It is part of our DNA in terms of how we think about accelerating growth. And things are moving quickly and we want to be a market leader in that segment. Dave Petratis : In depth, partnerships with the mega-techs which are important, partnerships with the integrators, like Lenel, our venture arm, I think you saw the announcement on Openpath, the sale to Motorola Solutions, an excellent example of how we're playing that game, and then continuing investments in the digital players that help drive our growth. Tim Wojs : Okay, great. I really appreciate that. It all makes sense. I guess the second question just on maybe bigger picture. Could you just frame for us how you're thinking about a recovery and maybe revenue contribution from the specification business? So you're obviously seeing an uptick on the specification side. But when do you think you could start to see that be a meaningful revenue contributor? Is that a full year benefit next year, or is it skewed towards the second half? Dave Petratis : I think you'll see that really gaining some speed Q2 of next year and through the traditional construction season. ABI has been up for three, four consecutive months at really record high at 60. I think we were there for a peak. It takes about 12 to 18 months based on the scope of those projects for us to really start seeing the momentum. Tim Wojs : Okay, great. Good luck, guys. Thanks for the time, guys. Dave Petratis : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Walsh : Hi. Good morning. Dave Petratis : Good morning. John Walsh : Maybe just two follow ups here. One, you had a little bit of a discussion there on K-12. You talked about the age, the security, more automation. But one thing you didn't mention was stimulus. And just curious, we're hearing that there's a lot of stimulus already been approved for that vertical, a lot of focus on HVAC, but there is a big demand on the infrastructure side for access control. Are you seeing any of that benefit yet or is that what you're kind of talking about might come through in '22 and beyond? Dave Petratis : As we try and unpack the stimulus package, we certainly see access control, school security as a part of that. Again, it's dominated I think by modernization, things that you talked about, HVAC. We're going to benefit as a result of that stimulus. I would also say, there will continue to be a drive in the K-12 sector to modernize. The average K-12 structure is 40 years old. Security threats persist and access into schools is becoming more sophisticated because of people's edge device, electronic locks, and Allegion is going to benefit from that. John Walsh : Great. Thanks. And then, obviously, you've lived through several inflationary cycles. We could argue this one's a little bit different. But can you talk about your ability to hold price when you come out of these inflationary cycles? There's probably some regular pricing activity. I think you used the term surcharges for some things as well that maybe those are a little bit more transitory and go away when inflation abates. But can you just talk about your historical experience if we\u2019re thinking about margin next year? Patrick Shannon : Yes. Sure, John. So historically, price increases announced that are permanent in nature stick going forward, okay, i.e., even in deflationary periods, prices remain the same. And fairly disciplined industry here. We did announce some surcharges on particular products that are more heavy in steel-related components. And those, of course, go away assuming the price of steel comes down. But the majority of our price increases are permanent price increase that we expect will stick going forward, even when inflation comes down. Dave Petratis : I would add to that. The majority of my industrial career in the electrical industry and now security, we have as a guiding management principle as our input costs go up, I expect to capture that plus. And we're very driven on the inputs as well as the pricing systems here. And it's part of our DNA. And it's never been more important as we face inflationary pressures. John Walsh : Thanks. I appreciate you taking the questions. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just a couple loose ends here, a lot of ground covered. First, maybe a little shout out to your international friends. Just wonder if you could give a little bit of color how you're thinking about the margins in the back half there, right? Usually we start fairly low in the first half and step up materially. I'm assuming from this kind of better run rates here in the first half, you\u2019re not expecting the same magnitude of step up by assuming margins are going higher. Can you just elaborate on the trajectory there, the price cost dynamics in those markets collectively? And what if any other restructuring benefits you have coming through? Dave Petratis : Yes, Jeff, so thanks for bringing that up. Outstanding performance by the international team, particularly when you're looking at not only margin increase but the top line growth, and that's been a key contributor to the margin expansion there as well. But you may recall, if you kind of look at that segment in isolation, they were probably out in front of this pandemic quicker in terms of reducing costs, managing that side of the equation, restructuring programs that kind of went through both in Europe and Asia Pacific. We also are seeing the benefit of the amalgamation of both the Asia Pacific and European segments coming together as Allegion International. All that combined has really accelerated the margin improvement year-over-year. The restructuring actions, the benefits we saw in the first half, kind of lapped, if you will, beginning in Q3. So you're not going to see the step up in margin expansion year-over-year. Seasonally, you know this Jeff that the margins expand in Q4 for that segment, in particular. We would expect the same seasonal increase. But the year-over-year margin improvement you're not going to see and there was some one-time benefits in Q4 that are non-recurring this year, bounce back in cost, higher inflation, these type of things. But a great performance first half. We would expect kind of this continuous margin improvement going into next year too. And so really like what the team has done there, how they're executing, driving top line growth, those types of things, a great performance. Jeff Sprague : Great. Understood. And then just back to kind of the whole backlog top line calculus here. I guess your guide essentially kind of indicates revenues in Q3 and Q4 will be similar to Q2, which is not atypical for your business. But I guess I'm also hearing though that perhaps you're suggesting the top line is just governed here by the supply and other constraints. Is that really the message that they're kind of in normal circumstances, there would be more upside into the back half just unlocking this backlog, but just the physical ability to get it out the door, whether it's your own factory or inputs from suppliers, just keeping a lid on what you can actually execute on in 2021? Dave Petratis : You read that correctly. I think we've assessed, okay, what's possible here? We'll move that backlog through. I think we are mindful of the constraints on our supply base. We're also I think grounded that labor may be the tightest element in all of this, and it affects our customers and suppliers. So you've got to kind of take a stiff view at this. When are people going to come back to work and availability improve? We think that's a long-term problem. We think the culture of Allegion, how we run our business and the strength of our supply chain will do better than the competition in that battle. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks for the color. Dave Petratis : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dave Petratis for any closing remarks. Dave Petratis : Thanks for joining today's call. Allegion\u2019s future remains bright. And I'd like to leave you with some key highlights of our call. Market demand is robust and it has returned to pre-pandemic levels faster and stronger than anticipated. This is extremely encouraging. Inflation has accelerated and there are industry-wide supply chain pressures. These constraints are not unique to us and we will actively manage both of these dynamics. The resulting backlog we are building sets us up well for the remainder of '21 and '22. Last, Allegion is stronger, more structurally sound as we continue to invest during the pandemic. As a result, we are positioned well for profitable growth, and we'll continue to aggressively execute on our strategy of seamless access. Have a great day today. Thanks for your attendance. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Dave and Patrick will now discuss our third quarter 2021 results, which will be followed by a Q&A session. Please, for the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and one short follow-up. We would like to give everyone an opportunity given the time allotted. Please go to Slide 4, and I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave Petratis : Thanks, Tom. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Before we go into our third quarter results, I'd like to take a minute to acknowledge and congratulate my fellow Allegion team members for their ongoing dedication to the environment, society and governance. I'm humbled and honored to share that just last week Allegion was recognized for ESG leadership through two different awards : the Robert W. Campbell Award and the Jackson Lewis Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Champion Award. The Campbell Award is an annual recognition by The National Safety Council, America's leading non-profits safety advocate. It is the premier award for excellence in integrating environmental, health and safety management into business operating systems. Winners have strong processes and show measurable achievement over a five-year period in the EH&S performance that leads to productivity and profitability and are expected to demonstrate a long-term track record of not just the EH&S compliance, but also critical improvements. The prestigious award is also known for its rigorous application process with a systematic review and audit attached to it. Submissions are reviewed by management, labor, academic and government experts from around the world followed by a meticulous audit format at three or more of a company's global sites. With this in mind, Campbell Award winners are an elite group of organizations. Past winners include Boeing, Cummins, Dow Chemical, DuPont, Honeywell Aerospace and Johnson & Johnson. Allegion is proud to have our name added to this best-in-class list. We are also excited to have been named the Jackson Lewis Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Champion by the Indiana Chamber of Commerce. This is a statewide honor that recognizes an organization making significant strides in the workplace. The judge noted that Allegion was chosen as its first ever winner of this award because of our company's proactive and intentional diversity, equity and inclusion efforts around the globe. We have strong momentum on our diversity efforts and we know there's more work to be done. We're not asking the people of Allegion to agree on everything, but we need to be a place where racism and bias are rejected, where inclusion is a way of life and we're all employees feel they belongand can contribute to our business success. Importantly, I've shared before that Allegion's ESG commitments are vital to how our company achieves results and the way we do business. ESG excellence will give us better long-term outcomes across the board, better employee safety, better employee engagement, better productivity, better creativity, better innovation and stronger financial performance. We see this firsthand and external data points to it as well. Please go to Slide 5. During the quarter, we experienced continued strength in demand, particularly in the America's non-residential market. This trend began in Q2 and accelerated through Q3. Leading indicators like ABI and Dodge new construction indices remain positive. Increased demand is for both discretionary projects and new construction and is across all verticals and product categories. The recovery has been faster than we originally anticipated and is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. Residential end market demand is also favorable across both retail point of sale and new home construction. The strength in demand continues to constrain the global supply chain's ability to fully meet demand requirements. Similar to last quarter, this was especially prevalent in electronic components in Q3. As I'm sure you're aware this is a global issue and not isolated to Allegion or to any single industry. We have redirected resources and are taking actions such as reconfiguring and redesigning products, as well as developing alternative sources of supply to help alleviate the pressures we are experiencing in procuring electronic components. Additionally, material and freight input costs continue to accelerate during Q3. We now anticipate material and freight inflation to be approximately $60 million higher compared to last year. In addition to the supply chain pressures we're seeing for electronics, there are also widespread industry shortages of labor and other components. Once again, these issues are not Allegion specific and we expect the global constraints driving these shortages to continue beyond 2021. These challenges led to margin deterioration in the quarter. We will leverage the strength of our supply chain management capabilities as well as priced to help mitigate these impacts going forward. During the quarter, the continued robust demand coupled with the supply chain pressures resulted in record backlogs, approximately four times normal levels. We estimate that widespread shortages have delayed approximately $80 million to $100 million of 2021 revenue. We believe this impact is evenly distributed across the third and fourth quarter. We do not believe this is lost revenue, but expect it will be recovered as supply chain constraints ease. Now let's turn to the third quarter performance, for more details please go to Slide 6. Revenue for the third quarter was $717 million, a decrease of 1.6% on both a reported and organic basis. The organic revenue decrease was driven by lower volume in the Americas region related to the aforementioned electronics, components and labor shortages. Currency tailwind and acquisitions offset the impact of divestitures. Patrick will share more details on the regions in a moment. Adjusted operating margins decreased by 330 basis points in the third quarter. Higher input costs, productivity challenges and volume deleverage drove the majority of the decrease. Incremental investments important to our future growth caused 90 basis points of the decline. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.56 decreased $0.11 or 6.6% versus the prior year. The decrease was driven by reduced operating income offset by a favorable tax rate and share count. Year-to-date available cash flow came in at $327.7 million, an increase of $71.6 million, or 28% versus the prior year. The increased cash flow was driven by higher year-to-date net earnings along with improvement in net working capital and reduced capital expenditures. Patrick will now take you through the financial results and I'll be back later to discuss our 2021 outlook and wrap up. Patrick Shannon : Thanks, Dave, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to Slide number 7. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter 2020 reported earnings per share was $1.58. Adjusting $0.09 for charges related to restructuring and impairment, the 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $1.67. Favorable tax drove a $0.13 increase in earnings per share. The negative tax rate for the third quarter reflects favorable settlements of uncertain tax positions, a benefit of mix of income as well as the non-recurring unfavorable tax impact in 2020 related to certain valuation allowances. Reduced share count drove another favorable $0.04 per share. Acquisitions and divestitures had a positive $0.02 per share impact. Operational results decreased earnings per share by $0.21 driven by higher material and freight costs. Productivity challenges and volume deleverage which more than offset the favorable impacts of price and currency. Investment spend increased during the quarter and reduced earnings per share by $0.06. As a reminder, the incremental investment spend is predominantly related to R&D, technology and market investments to accelerate future growth. The combination of interest and other income drove another $0.03 per share reduction. This results in adjusted third quarter 2021 earnings per share with $1.56, a decrease of $0.11 or 6.6% compared to the prior year. Lastly, we have a $0.03 per share increase driven by a gain on the sale of an equity method investment offset slightly by the combination of restructuring charges and acquisition and integration expenses. After giving effect to these items, you arrive at the third quarter 2021 reported earnings per share of $1.59. Please go to Slide Number 8. This slide depicts the components of our revenue performance for the third quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we experienced an organic revenue decline of 1.6% in the third quarter. The electronics, components and labor shortages primarily in the Americas region had an impact on our ability to meet the continued strong demand. Still we realized good price performance, which offset some of the volume decline. Currency continued to be a tailwind to total growth and offset the combined impact of acquisitions and divestitures. In total, reported revenue reduced by 1.6%. Please go to Slide Number 9. Third quarter revenues for the Allegion Americas segment were $524.4 million, down 2.7% on a reported basis and 3% organically. As previously stated, the supply chain pressures we are experiencing drove the revenue decline. We are still seeing strong market demand, which has resulted in record backlogs, particularly in the non-residential part of the business. The region continued to deliver good price realization. Our latest price increase went into effect at the beginning of October. So we expect the price realization to accelerate in the future. On volume, Americas nonresidential was down low single digits driven by the electronics, components and labor shortages. Americas residential was down high single digits. This was uniquely driven by the prior year being inflated by channel refill coming out of the pandemic shutdowns experienced in Q2 of 2020. The shortage of electronic components also had a negative impact on residential performance primarily in the DIY space, a big box retail and e-commerce. Electronics revenue was down high single digits driven by shortages of electronic components of both the nonresidential and residential businesses. Electronics and touchless solutions remain a long-term growth driver and as an integral to our investment in innovation efforts. Americas adjusted operating income of $133.7 million, decrease 19.7% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter was down 540 basis points. The decrease was driven by higher material and freight costs, productivity challenges related to inconsistent supply and volume deleverage. Incremental investments had a 100 basis points dilutive impact on adjusted margins. Please go to Slide Number 10. The Allegion International segment delivered another solid quarter. Third quarter revenues were $192.6 million, up 1.7% and up 2.5% on an organic basis. We continue to see strength in our SimonsVoss, Interflex and Global Portable Security businesses, which along with good price realization drove the organic revenue growth. Favorable currency and acquisition impacts also contributed to total revenue growth and were slightly offset by divestitures. International adjusted operating income of $21.3 million, increased 4.9% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased by 40 basis points. The margin increase was driven primarily by volume leverage along with favorable impacts from divestitures and currency. The combination of price productivity inflation were an 80 basis point headwind to margins. Incremental investments reduced margins by 40 basis points. Please go to Slide Number 11. Year-to-date available cash flow for the third quarter 2021 came in at $327.7 million, which is an increase of $71.6 million compared to the prior year period. The increase is attributed to higher year-to-date earnings, improvements in networking capital and reduce capital expenditures. Our cash flow generation continues to be an asset to the company. Looking at the chart to the right, it shows working capital as a percentage of revenues decreased based on a four-point quarter average. The business continues to manage working capital efficiently and generate strong cash flow. I will now hand it back over to Dave for some comments on our full year of 2021 outlook. Dave Petratis : Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide Number 12. On October 1, we issued a pre-release to our earnings and updated our 2021 full year outlook for revenue, earnings per share and available cash flow. We are reaffirming those updated outlooks. We have talked at length about the demand strengthened the Americans business as well as supply chain pressures that are having impact on our ability to meet that demand, which will delay an estimated $80 million to $100 million of revenue. The outlook for total revenue in the Americas is now projected to be at 1% to 1.5% with organic revenue growth at 0.5% to 1%. In the Allegion International segment, we have not seen as large of an impact from component and labor shortages. In our SimonsVoss, Interflex and Global Portable Security businesses continued to perform well. For that region, we expect total revenue growth to be between 12% and 13% with organic growth of 9% to 10%. All-in for total Allegion, total revenue is projected to be up 4% to 4.5% and organic revenue is expected to increase 3% to 3.5%. We're expecting reported EPS to come in the range of $4.95 to $5.05 per share and adjusted EPS to be between $5 and $5.10. Our outlook for available cash flow is projected to be $460 million to $480 million. The outlook assumes investment spend of approximately $0.15 to $0.20 per share. The full year adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 9%. The outlook for outstanding diluted shares is approximately $90.5 million. Please go to Slide number 13. As we close the presentation and move on to Q&A, I want to take some time to stress Allegion\u2019s strong long-term fundamentals. First, even with the disruption caused by the global pandemic, our strategy around seamless access and electronic transformation remains strong. We expect electronic and seamless access solutions to be the future of access control and we are using multiple innovation engines to lead the industry. You've seen proactive work from Allegion through Allegion Ventures, our recent acquisitions like Yonomi and in our Interflex business, accelerating our software and tech capabilities. We're making investments and expanding partnerships with mega techs and leading access control platforms. We're making significant progress on our ESG journey. This is evident with the two awards that we received earlier this month. The Campbell Award given by the National Safety Council is a very prestigious honor and we joined an elite group of previous winners. I'm also proud of the Jackson Lewis Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Champion Award, which we received from the Indiana Chamber, which recognizes our proactive leadership in diversity, equity and inclusion. Congratulations to be Allegion team. All markets in America remain robust. We continue to see positive trends from leading indicators like ABI and the Dodge New Construction Index and expect these trends to continue into 2022. With the International segment, the strength in our SimonsVoss, Interflex and Global Portable Security business persist. We have aligned and adjusted resources to navigate and adapt to supply chain pressures that the world is experiencing. Actions taken including the redesign of products, the development of alternative supply sources and we continue to leverage our pricing power. Allegion\u2019s supply chain will continue to differentiate us and the strength in our backlogs would indicate that our channel partners believe we will navigate through the global pressures [indiscernible]. Demand remains strong. We have implemented pricing actions that will carry forward into next year and there's substantial backlog to work down. With that backdrop and assuming supply chain pressures related to inflation and component shortages begin to ease, we expect solid revenue growth with year-over-year margin improvement and continued strong cash flow generation in the 2022. The future of Allegion remains bright. Now, Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe O'Dea: Hi. Good morning everyone. Dave Petratis : Good morning, Joe. Joe O'Dea: First question is just related to any visibility you have around the timing of relief from supply chain constraints. You've talked about this extending into 2022, but are you seeing anything out there and based on conversations with your suppliers that gives you confidence in when you start to see some relief? Dave Petratis : So my first observation, your past records sometimes is a predictor. Allegion performed extremely well through the first phases of this pandemic. Number two is some of the strength of our supply chain adaptability was evident. If we had not adapted, made design changes over the last couple of quarters, our backlog would even be larger. So we feel very good about the performance and the adaptability, flexibility. It's clear the electronics is going to be a problem that all companies, including Allegion, will have to adapt to through 2022. I think an important element of the rest and it's the complexity of the Allegion supply chain is the return of labor pressures to our partner suppliers. This we'll have to continue to monitor. This is everything from castings to power supplies to wire harnesses. There is a labor scarcity across the globe. And again, I believe our ability to adapt and our philosophy to produce in region will help Allegion. Joe O'Dea: And then related to backlog and catch up and you made the comment about backlog being four times higher than normal, how do you think about managing that? So when you do start to get some relief in the supply chain, do you think about kind of ramping up to deliver to customers as fast as possible, which could then create some inefficiencies in a strained production system? Or do you think about managing that and maybe it takes longer to deliver over time, but not straining the production system in that process? Dave Petratis : So we've got a lot of experience in production systems, including the man that runs the company, me, 41 years. I think I liked the backlog. I think if component supplies \u2013 as if that regains health, we will actually pick up efficiencies. There has been gross inefficiencies through COVID, these supply chains. An important element is our ability to bring on and flux our own labor and I've got high confidence in our ability to do that. Joe O'Dea: Great, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning everybody. Dave Petratis : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : As you guys talked about clearly lots of challenges in the marketplace today, I know that as you kind of think about the Americas margins being down 500 basis points to 600 basis points year-over-year, our investments of about 100 basis points impacting the margin. Can you maybe parse that out a little bit more for us like do we know how much of it is coming from higher material and freight costs? How much of it is more kind of like the productivity issues? Just any other additional color around that would be helpful. Dave Petratis : Yes, Joe, so the significant portion of the margin degradation year-over-year is predominantly inflation and freight costs. And then we've got productivity challenges associated with some of the component shortages and those types of things, creating inefficiencies at our facilities. So if you think about it relative to normally we've done a good job in terms of managing the price inflation dynamic, we're underwater today as we kind of look at that price being lower than the incremental material and freight costs that will get better. As we kind of progress here, we're putting in more price increases to make up for the Delta. One of the challenges is kind of given the high backlog and the fact that a lot of the backlog today is kind of price protected. You don't see the benefit of the price increases coming through and offsetting the incremental inflation until going into 2022. So we're still going to be under pressure for the balance of the year, but inflation really accelerated particularly when you look year-over-year on steel components and those types of things. So it's just \u2013 it's one of these short-term phenomenons. If you assume that inflation has kind of peaked today, going into 2022 things will kind of continue to get better than we would expect to be in the positive end of the equation as we progress throughout 2022. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's helpful, Patrick. And maybe just kind of following on there, as you think about then \u2013 it sounds like you're going to be underwater again in the fourth quarter. As you think about like the pricing that you're putting through, do you typically include a fuel surcharge? Or is this kind of like stickier pricing that you expect to get in the 2022 timeframe? And then we've also gotten some questions from investors today around the fact that pricing stepped down on a year-over-year basis if you took a look at the second quarter versus 3Q. So curious like any comments around why pricing was a little bit weaker in 3Q versus 2Q. Dave Petratis : So on your first question \u2013 so we've managed pricing broadly and it's really dependent upon product category, some of our products that are more steel related, i.e., steel doors, those types of things would carry surcharges associated with that, but mostly across the product portfolio is through list price increases is kind of how we manage it, so it's more permanent in nature. The year-over-year Delta, you kind of have to look at it again by product category, a little pressure and some of the discounts, residential, for example, a little bit harder to kind of pass through the price increases. So that's really what you're seeing there. If you, kind of, look at the bulk of our business, commercial, year-over-year price increase. Patrick Shannon : I'd add to this. Our hollow metal business, list price increases and surcharges, on the general hardware business two price increases in the year and will adapt to the pressures as we go into 2022 and certainly going hard at the residential products as well. And my message here would be in the addition to freight surcharges, we're pulling all levers on price realization. And I think as we get past this momentary surge that occurred in Q2 and Q3 on inflation, we'll continue our discipline around price performance as we move into 2022. Joe Ritchie : Thank you. That's helpful. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Yes, hi, guys. Dave Petratis : Good morning, Andrew. Patrick Shannon : Good morning. Andrew Obin : Yes. Just to follow up on Joe's question on pricing, I'm just a little bit surprised by the pricing myself. We did some channel checks with electrical distributors in the markets. Dave, you would know very well, one of the largest players in North America has pricing effect I think sort of policy at this point in order to sort of cleanse out the backlog. I think HVC guys that's selling a lot of similar channels, I think have had like four price increases this year. I mean the industry structure seems to be quite favorable. Why is it so hard to get a price increase through? Or who is being aggressive, particularly you seem to highlight a residential is one player being aggressive, people out of Asia being aggressive, which was surprising because I would have expected they would have difficulties getting stuff on the boat. Just maybe a little bit more color there. Thank you. Dave Petratis : So, I'd give a completely different perspective, Andrew. I know the electrical quite well. Think about the amount of electrical pipe, wire and distribution gear that goes in, in the first six months of a construction project, we'd submit our quotes get orders at the same time. And that \u2013 those products are delivered at the end of that cycle. When we put a quote, that's carried for a period of time, but we honor that order and so we eat that inflationary pressure. The cycle for the electrical industry is much faster than ours. We've been aggressive on the price increases as well as surcharges and it's not apples to apples. We're both in new construction. On new quotes and bids, we're really raising the levels every day. And I hope that color maybe helps you understand leading products, the electrical versus lagging products on the hardware side. Patrick Shannon : I'll just add, Andrew. It's not a question of realization. In other words, we'll get the price increase. It's more of a timing issue. So, you will begin to see sequential improvement beginning Q4 relative to the price increases we put in the market. And that will continue to accelerate into 2022, year-over-year and sequentially. Andrew Obin : In 2022, you'll get some of the benefit of these 2021 price increases. So you'll get it, but later. Patrick Shannon : Yes. Andrew Obin : Got you. And just a follow up question, just a difference in performance between North America and I guess international, which I sort of think mostly Europe, as I think about your brands, Interflex, I guess it is mostly software, but it does have electronic components if I think about I guess CISA is the one that's purely mechanical, but on SimonsVoss, which you've highlighted also has large electronic component. Why are you able to avoid the kind of disruption related to electronic components and labor in Europe that you experienced in the U.S. because I would imagine the electronic components in Europe are also getting sourced in Asia? Thank you. Dave Petratis : So electronic components tight in all sectors of the world, the differences between SimonsVoss a lesser extent and Interflex and the core business in the Americas is pure suppliers. We had designed around the Americas Texas Instruments, NXP, Texas both have had their supply chain issues. The European products more around a different set of suppliers and it's those differences. And the adaptability important here many of the newest Allegion products that drives battery efficiency, WiFi connectivity that makes us the leading products in the world are closer to the supply chain challenges in the Americas than they are in Europe. Andrew Obin : Got you. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot Dave. Dave Petratis : You're welcome, Andrew. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Ruttenbur with Imperial Capital. Please go ahead. Brian Ruttenbur : Yes, thank you very much. My first question and I'm sorry to keep asking about price increases, but I'm going to ask one on that and one on \u2013 a follow-up on a different subject, but the first is on price increases. Can you say specifically how much you've increased prices? ASSA has gone up about 15% multiple, in total, this year. NAPCOs said that 3% they've increased. What have you increased so far this year and what do you plan to increase on the year? Dave Petratis : I would say, again you have to look across the different product sets, so it varies. If you're looking at all price increases, i.e., what we talked about there's list price, there's surcharges, there's things related to freight those that have heavier steel related i.e., steel doors those types of things would carry a much higher price increase realization than your traditional products, locks and exits, closers, those types of things. So, list prices for the year would be with both price increases north of 6% with more to come in the future. Patrick Shannon : I think you also got to include the surcharges on top of that, and this is a big end in our quote activities, we apply discount schemes that give us the ability to rise price based on the project. So again, I feel very good on our pricing analytics. There's that gap in the backlog that we may have quoted over a year ago. We honor those firm orders and they're delivered sometimes over the periods of years. And as we move into 2022, we'll reassess this again and be early and aggressive to make sure that price continues to cover our input cost as we've done since the creation of the company. Brian Ruttenbur : Right. And then just as my follow-up real quick on \u2013 off just real quick maybe you make a comment about their move with HHI from Spectrum and how you anticipate competing on that. I know we've spoken offline on that, but I want to just hear what you think \u2013 how that's going to impact Allegion moving forward. Dave Petratis : So you never want to see your number one competitor or market leader gets bigger. Rest assured that we also looked hard at the Kwikset HHI assets over the years. And I think if you really step back and study the dimensions of Kwikset and how they performed under HHI, I believe also will actually bring a level of discipline to the market. It's certainly our great Schlage brand, the Kwikset brands. There's plenty of room to compete and we've met this challenge I think credibly over the last several decades. Schlage in terms of its electronic leadership, if you look at consumer reports electronics that I think was published in April of this year, three of the top eight walks are ours. We're the number one replacement walk and it's going to be continued competition against two world leaders. Brian Ruttenbur : Thank you, Dave. Operator : The next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just my first question is perhaps on the demand outlook, which hasn't really been touched on yet. I remember in that upcycle in U.S. non-res in sort of 2006, 2007 and 2008, that upcycle in terms of projects did suffered some headwinds because of cost inflation and labor led developers to delay in projects and so forth. And so you had these kinds of rolling push outs and delays. Just wondered what your perspectives are on the risks of that type of phenomenon recurring in the current environment when you're talking to developers looking at your quote activity and so forth. Dave Petratis : I'd say, each bust and boom cycle sets its own history. We're still living this aspect of it, but as I reviewed the macro demand factors, our backlogs and then recent travel, I would think I was in five states last week. The sentiment that I feel, see and, and living here every day at Allegion is I'm extremely positive. I think we've got three solid years ahead of us as I think about the strategic planning period, working through the supply chain issues, I think there is key infrastructure needs and we have a housing economy that's significantly under inventory for single-family homes, which also is a generator for commercial and institutional development. So, I packed out all together in borrowing another disruption. I liked to go ahead in terms of the business conditions for construction and for Allegion. Julian Mitchell : I see. So you have not seen major projects being deferred or postponed? Dave Petratis : We track cancellations and I'd say it's at a normal level. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up, I'm trying to wrap together your comments on pricing. If you look at your sort of your operating income bridge that line for inflation in excessive pricing and productivity, obviously it's been negative for a couple of quarters now. When you look at the margins in the backlog and the pace of completion, should we assume that that line can go back to sort of breakeven sort of third quarter of next year? Is that the rough timeline? Dave Petratis : I would \u2013 at \u2013 Q3 next year is sort of positive is what I would anticipate basis of a constant inflation relative to what we're seeing today in terms of no further increase year-over-year. But the Delta, i.e., the gap between price inflation improving up until that point, so the rate of change will get better as we progress. Patrick Shannon : Julian, I'd also add as we \u2013 as you and I think about that backlog, if some of the highest margin products that we produce, electronic locks and exit devices are elements, heavy elements of that backlog, the exit devices, heavy complexity, which we \u2013 the supply chain pressures create some challenges in that, but those supply chain pressures will improve. The mix of that will roll through. In addition to the price increases, I like our opportunities going forward. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Walsh : Hi. Good morning. Dave Petratis : Good morning. John Walsh : Maybe just to follow on Julian\u2019s last question there. If you look in your bridge, I know it's called the volume and mix, but it was a headwind year-over-year, but you actually had non-residential declining less than residential in the Americas. So maybe it has to do with the mix within non-res. And you talked about some of your higher margin products now growing backlog, but we'd just love to unpack that a little bit, why the mix was negative despite non-resi growing better than residential, at least on a relative basis? Patrick Shannon : Yes. So you hit on it. It's really within the product portfolio of non-residential products. As Dave indicated high margin products being impacted more and that's kind of what we're seeing it in the backlog due to shortages of components. And so it's really within the non-residential business that you're seeing a mix element, given that non-resi was higher than resi for the quarter. John Walsh : Great. And then I'm going to take a stab at this. I think earlier in the year, you kind of pointed international margins up low double digits. Obviously, you've seen really good progress there through the year. You've given us the mid point of your guide, a lot of other information. It does seem like that implies the Q4 Americas margin kind of steps down more than seasonality would assume in Q4. And also just thinking about the decremental still being pretty challenged there, any color you can help us on how to think about that from the model perspective or I'll just leave it there, however you'd like to help us out with that sequential decline implied? Patrick Shannon : Yes. So kind of we touched on it a little bit earlier. It's predominantly given the price inflation dynamics still under pressure. Some of the inefficiencies from a productivity standpoint, we'll continue given the component challenges supply base that's really the \u2013 you are going to see some decrements sequentially. But then as we kind of continue to move into 2022, you wouldn't see obviously that a big of a change in the first part of the year and then approving certainly in the back half. John Walsh : Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. Dave Petratis : Welcome. Operator : The next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. David MacGregor : Yes. So good morning, everyone. Dave Petratis : Good morning. David MacGregor : Patrick, you've made reference a couple of times now to the expectation that maybe inflation is peaked. And I guess I'm just interested in what gives you confidence that would be the case. Have you provisions in place through some of your procurement agreements that lock pricing now or hedges that are in place to give you the confidence to say that. But if you just elaborate on that side, so I appreciate it? Patrick Shannon : So that's kind of the commentary was more around kind of our assumptions right now. I mean, if there's continued pressure in the marketplace to some of the component challenges, then that would certainly put pressure on our assumptions as we look forward to 2022. But if you kind of look at some of the forecasting information relative to steel and those type of things, the expectation is, is that as we go into next year, it starts to alleviate itself and maybe trend down. And that would be positive to what we're thinking today. David MacGregor : Can you just remind us what \u2013 how much of your businesses is walk up with annual contracts or supply agreements versus spot purchases? You can elaborate on that a little bit\u2026 Patrick Shannon : A small portion that it's mostly on raw steel. We kind of look forward and we've got some arrangements with some of our supply base that has fixed rate agreements. Those then kind of fluctuate basis on changes in the market on a forward basis. And so it's small. A lot of our supply base is indexed to steel, if you will. And so it's really just on the purchase of raw steel, which is a small component relative to our overall purchasing. David MacGregor : Okay. Thank you for that. And then just as a follow-up. You just talk about installation labor and the extent to which that may be a sort of frustration at this point, or how you see that developing as a potential bottleneck or impediment in 2022? Dave Petratis : Some broad comments on labor. And it's from a general labor through the trades to professionals. Labor is tight, professional help on a worldwide basis. Second, when you look particularly at construction labor, the gap has grown. Skilled trades were a problem going into the pandemic. The problem has widened slightly. In my mind extends cycle times for construction projects and snowplows, what I think are strong business conditions well into the future. David MacGregor : Would you consider it all investing in the development of that labor for the market, as a means of alleviating that constraint? Dave Petratis : We are investors. I will get off the phone here today, and its manufacturing month in the United States. Allegion plays a very active role in promoting our industry, leading culture, diversity opportunities, tuition reimbursement programs, healthy lifestyle, to attract people and have done it since the creation of the company, number one. Number two, I think manufacturing, I'm extremely proud of is a great place to develop talent and we will make investments in our wage structures to continue to keep Allegion as the best employer with wages and benefits and the communities we operate around the world. David MacGregor : Thanks David. Operator : The next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Please go ahead. Tim Wojs : Hey guys. Good morning. Dave Petratis : Good morning, Tim. Tim Wojs : Maybe just dovetailing off of David's question there, could you just \u2013 when you think about the new non-resi cycle and how investors should kind of think about it? The leading indicators have obviously been really robust over the last seven or eight months. How would you think about converting those cycle? It was kind of leading interiors into revenue for you guys? I mean, are those new construction projects that could contribute to you in the second half of 2022? Or do you think at this point it's probably more prudent to think 2023? Dave Petratis : I think you've got to take the strong cycle and as I look at the macro indicators that you did positive, you've got to lay on that backlog, which will take the better part of six, seven months for us to eat through. And I think extremely robust I see education, I see health care. I think you've also \u2013 I've always been concerned about commercial, extremely positive in terms of the macro. There's lots of money on the sidelines to go reinvent this commercial real estate and the new office of the future. So as I look at education, healthcare, commercial, even multifamily is honing longer. And I think investment is going to come in needed infrastructure. We could get an infrastructure bill. So as I look at that, Tim, I like it for the next three to five years. Tim Wojs : Okay. Okay. And then maybe more of just a modeling question. So you guys outlined that the split on the deferred sales, I think was kind of even between Q3 and Q4, but I think if you just kind of roll that into the model, I mean, there's a bigger think you're down double digits or that's the implication in the fourth quarter versus down maybe low single digits in Americas in Q3. So, any perspective there you can kind of add as to why that is? Is it just seasonality comps? Patrick Shannon : Yes. Seasonality comps, the component shortages plus \u2013 last year, you may recall what the rebound in a residential business and it was coming out of COVID, there was channel refill in the business, right. Restocking the shelves on retail and e-commerce and so that\u2019s certainly had a fairly significant impact on last year. So you're getting into a difficult comp as relates to our residential business. Tim Wojs : Okay. Okay. Got you. And then $80 million to $100 million of deferred revenue, I mean, how does that kind of come back next year? I mean, is it \u2013 is there some sort of burst that kind of happens and you kind of convert that in 2022 or is it just kind of result in a little bit of a longer cycle? Patrick Shannon : No. I think you need to think about it depending on the flow of components and labor, it's a tailwind as we roll through the year. And in a manufacturing environment, you can step up about 20% just by working Saturdays. You need to kind of think about it. If I go to Sundays, I get 40%, people don't work seven days a week for six months. You got to think about, it will step up. It's a tailwind, barring if you get \u2013 if we get improvement in components, both electronic and general components, we're going to see that as a tailwind as we roll through the first half of next year. And if the component situation and labor improves work about and gain more share. Tim Wojs : Okay. Okay. Good luck on the rest of the year, guys. Thanks for your time. Dave Petratis : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from John [ph] Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning guys. Dave Petratis : Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : Dave. So electronics are 20-ish percent of the business, probably a little more than that now. The $80 million to $100 million that you talked about does sound pretty biased to 4Q and I guess what precipitates out of that is it's pretty high percentage of electronics like that virtually electronics going to zero, or how should we think about the split of that headwind between the electrified product versus the mechanical products? Dave Petratis : I'd say 40% electronics, 60% mechanical. I'd also, I think you've been in our factories here in Indianapolis complexity when things are common right is our friend. We'll make 2200 variations of the Von Duprin exit device today. And any one of those components in shortage, whether it's a casting, a wire harness as a power supply and electronic board puts pressure on that supply chain and that's what we're living today and confident in our teams to work through it. Remember too, it's not necessarily my ability to put labor in the seat. It's also my supply chain. We pulled hard on redesign shifting over a 100 engineers to redesign predominantly boards but other components. And the second thing I\u2019d say is our flexibility, we've offered to put our people insights to help strengthen our supply chain vendors. And I share that example just because the labor thing goes across transportation, supply chain, getting in through the ports and a level of complexity that I've maybe never seen in my 41 years. Unidentified Analyst : And then just thinking about the \u2013 kind of the unwind of this current tightness. I think an earlier question asked about trade labor, is that the biggest governor of how much the business can grow next year to the teams like you have the ingredients, the demand is there maybe a bit more backlog than usual? It just how quick can we get, installers both on new construction and retrofit is that sort of the KPI that we should be focused on? Dave Petratis : I think I would describe it Josh, is there's pacing constraints and labor from the design phase. We just saw a record ABI through the installation phase and I think projects will have longer lead times in an environment that's extremely positive in terms of their willingness to invest. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thanks. Dave Petratis : You're welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Please go ahead. Chris Snyder : Thank you. Thank you. So my first question is on the deferred $80 million to $100 million of revenue, seems like the majority of this is coming from the Americas. In your previous commentary, I think, said that it could take six to seven months to work through this elevated backlog and I think the ability to ramp manufacturing 20% by working Saturdays, I think kind of suggests that this could be realized this $80 million to $100 million in 2022. And obviously, I know there's some uncertainty around the ability to source components. But I guess is that reasonable to think that this could be realized next year, because it's a pretty substantial kind of mid single digit tailwind to the Americas segment. Patrick Shannon : As you think about 2022, the backlog will be a tailwind, constrained by availability of electronics. That tightness will run into 2023 and then the overall labor. We see \u2013 I don't know if you ever, it's an industrial game we call the beer game, bottlenecks move. There's bottlenecks at the ports, there's bottlenecks in labor. These things are going to be moving throughout the year, but my fundamental belief is Allegion has a superior ability to navigate the nation and the world will navigate it. And we'll see these things ease as we go through. And it's a tailwind to push that backlog through. Chris Snyder : I appreciate that. And then, second question on resi, it sounded like from the prepared remarks that there may be with some demand softening in the quarter. I think you guys called out do-it-yourself or DIY slowdown. So I guess my question is, was this maybe the resi softness part of the second half of revenue cut. And I guess, is there any reason to think that this gets better in 2022, as it seems like that could be more demand related than supply chain related? Dave Petratis : So again, I want you to think about that demand game, the supply chains on resi for all supplier was heavily disrupted in 2020. We were shut down for 15, 16 days. You had a demand surge, and this is very evident from the Big Box, Home Depot, Lowes reports in terms of increase investments and do-it-yourself projects. And then you had also housing picking up pretty rapidly that created a demand surge as we started coming out of the lockdowns record backlog in residential, which we have worked through. So I look at overall demand for resi as we move into 2022 is net positive. Based on continued starts of new construction, solid repair and replacement and good multi-family. So that whip is going on the supply chain. Make sure you think about that in your model, because I think a year ago, I'm sitting here talking through record backlogs in residential. We worked through that and I would suggest if you look at our performance versus our competitors that we gained share throughout the last eight quarters. Chris Snyder : I appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : And the last questioner will be Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead. Ryan Merkel : Hey everyone. Good morning. Dave Petratis : Good morning. Ryan Merkel : So I wanted to follow up on the timing of supply chain getting better. Is it fair to say that margins are bottoming in the second half of 2021, such that as we get into next year, you could see margins increase year-over-year, or is that maybe more of a second half 2022 events? Patrick Shannon : Probably more back-end loaded, but feel very confident. If you kind of look at the moves we're making on price, again, assuming inflation is peak. I mean, that's still a question mark, right? But I feel very confident relative to pushing through the backlog, getting some efficiencies that are factory productivity, these types of things. We will have margin incremental improvement in 2022 compared to 2021. No doubt in my mind. Ryan Merkel : All right. That's helpful. And then just stepping back maybe this question for David, but can you discuss the adoption curve for electronic? Is it faster now and also how are your customers rethinking access control in this new environment? Dave Petratis : Electronic access, electronic locks, the power of your edge device and its ability to interact with secured access is a powerful trend that will positively influence this industry for the coming decades. The electronic adoption is what I would describe as high single digits in normal times or pre-pandemic we've been able to deliver on that growth at mid, or excuse me, low single digit or low double digit gross of market growing high single digits. We're in a normalized time low double digits. So a clear trend you can see it in your everyday life. The overall market's still, there's 40 billion openings in the world less than 10% of those integrated. So bright for our industry and bright for Allegion. Ryan Merkel : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dave Petratis, our Chairman, President, and CEO for any closing remarks. Dave Petratis : Thanks for your questions today. I also want to thank our employees for their continued commitment, steadfastness in navigating the challenges over the last 22 months. Some final messages. Allegion remains a white house for our safety performance and our ESG advancements. Demand in our business remains robust and leading indicators are positive. Supply chain constraints, labor availability, and inflation are challenging. I'm confident in Allegion supply capability, adaptability to be strong, and the long-term fundamentals of Allegion remains bright and strong. Thank you for your time today. Have a safe day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. 00:24 I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Martineau. Please go ahead. Tom Martineau : 00:29 Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for Allegion's fourth quarter and full-year 2021 earnings call. With me today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. 00:48 Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and the presentation, which we will refer to in today's call, are available on our website at investor.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website. 01:02 Please go to Slides 2 and 3.

Dave and Patrick will now discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2021 results and provide an outlook for 2022, which will be followed by a Q&A session. 01:48 For the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and then re-enter the queue. We would like to give everyone an opportunity given the time allotted. 01:57 Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Dave. Dave Petratis : 02:00 Thanks, Tom. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Please go to Slide number 4. Q4 was tough for Allegion and although we achieved the expected results, we discussed last quarter, I was disappointed that we were unable to fully meet the market opportunity presented. 02:22 The strength and demand, particularly in America\u2019s non-residential end markets continued. And as I said last quarter, this trend began softly in Q1, accelerated in Q2, and continued throughout the back half of the year. 02:40 Leading indicators like specs written for Allegion America\u2019s, ABI, and Dodge new construction indices, retail point of sales, and macroeconomic indicators in our Allegion International segment all remained positive. These indicators suggest continued strength in all end markets for the foreseeable future. 03:02 However, with supply chain challenges, we continue to experience difficulty converting that demand into revenue. Typically, we\u2019d be able to gear up our supply base in short fashion, but the accelerated increase in demand occurred during an unprecedented time when suppliers where experiencing labor, raw material, transportation, and electronic component shortages creating tremendous global disruption. 03:32 What we typically resolve in a quarter is now taking much longer. We are making good progress on product redesigns and alternative sourcing, which should alleviate some of the supply chain pressure, but we do expect revenue to continue to be constrained in the near-term. 03:53 Even with the supply chain improvements we are making, it\u2019s important to note that the pressures in electronic components are expected to continue throughout 2022. Looking at price versus cost, we continue to experience high inflationary impacts for material cost, labor, and freight. The pricing that we put in place last year is currently lagging inflation. That coupled with productivity challenges is a major contributor to margin declines in Q4. 04:25 We implemented additional price increases during the fourth quarter and have already announced another price increase for Q1 2022 that goes into effect this month. We are aggressively pursuing price across all products and in all channels to offset unprecedented inflation and expect price to exceed inflation in 2022. 04:52 I do want to highlight our Allegion International business, which had another good quarter and closed out a strong year. The segment delivered robust organic revenue growth and solid margin expansion in 2021. 05:09 Looking forward, the increased demand and supply chain shortages have led to record backlog in our American non-residential business and coupled with the progress we are making on redesigns and alternative sourcing, we expect solid revenue growth in 2022 and into 2023. 05:30 As supply chain pressures ease, operational efficiencies will improve, which along with accelerated pricing will allow us to expand margins in 2022 and exit the year on a glide path back to peak performance. 05:47 Now, let's turn to the quarter\u2019s performance for more details. Please go to Slide 5. Revenue for the fourth quarter was 709 million, a decrease of 2.5%, compared to last year. Organic revenue declined 1.4%. The organic revenue decline in the quarter was driven by Allegion Americas, which experienced continued supply chain pressures that led to electronic and other component shortages. 06:17 Also embedded in the decline is a tough comparable to last year. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we had a large residential channel loading that was necessary to catch up from the shutdowns experienced earlier that year. The Americas volume declines more than [offset] [ph] the sequential improvements in price realization and the growth that the Allegion International segment delivered. Patrick will share more details on the business segments in a moment. 06:50 Adjusted operating margin decreased by 610 basis points in the fourth quarter. Continued inflationary pressures, productivity challenges, and volume de-leverage drove most of the decrease. Incremental investments for future growth cost 80 basis points of the decline. 07:10 Adjusted earnings per share of $1.11 decreased $0.38 or approximately 26% versus the prior year. Lower operating income was partially offset by favorable share count, year-over-year tax rate reduction, and other income. Available cash flow for the year came in at 443 million, which was flat to 2020. 07:36 Slightly lower adjusted earnings were offset by slightly lower capital expenditures. The cash flow impact of working capital was nearly neutral as well with increased inventory offset by other components of working capital. 07:52 As I think about the road ahead, I firmly believe our vision strategy and support of our seamless access is more relevant than ever. I also believe we have the right team and an engaged workforce that will respond to the challenges we face today. 08:09 We are bullish on construction and DIY markets for 2022 and continue to expect the IoT trends of electronic adoption and smart buildings to fuel growth for many years. Allegion\u2019s future is bright and we will return to the peak performance and profitability that you expect. 08:30 Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I'll be back to discuss our 2022 outlook. Patrick Shannon : 08:37 Thanks, Dave and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to Slide number 6. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the fourth quarter. 08:49 For the fourth quarter of 2020 reported earnings per share was $1.01, adjusting $0.48 for charges related to restructuring, M&A costs, impairments, as well as a loss on held for sale assets, the 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $1.49. 09:08 Favorable year-over-year tax rate and share count drove another $0.04 and $0.03 increase respectively. Interest and other income were slightly positive as were the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, both at $0.01 per share. 09:24 The story for the quarter is reflected in the operational results, which decreased earnings per share by $0.41. The inflation of productivity headwinds were predominantly driven from higher input costs, wage increases, and efficiencies from supply chain challenges and the bounce back of variable related costs, which were not as high in the prior year. 09:46 These added costs were partially offset by price. Pricing sequentially improved in the quarter and will continue to accelerate in 2022. Investment spending increased during the quarter and reduced earnings per share by $0.06 [when we] [ph] remain committed to investing in new product innovation and technology that will accelerate future growth and deliver solutions that enhance customer and end user experiences and connectivity. 10:15 This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2021 earnings per share of $1.11, a decrease of $0.38 or 25.5%, compared to the prior year. 10:25 Lastly, we have a $0.15 per share increase for the combination of a non-cash gain on a remeasurement of an Allegion Ventures investment offset by charges related to restructuring, M&A and debt refinancing. After giving effect to these items, you arrive at the fourth quarter of 2021 reported earnings per share of $1.26. 10:48 Please go to Slide number 7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the fourth quarter, as well as for the full-year of 2021. As indicated, we experienced a 1.4% organic revenue decline in the fourth quarter. Like Q3, the electronics and other component shortages, primarily in the Americas region, had an impact our ability to meet continued strong demand. 11:15 We achieved the highest quarter price realization in the year, which offset some of the volume decline. For the full-year, you can see that total revenue was up 5.4% with organic revenue growth of 4.5%. Both segments of the business delivered organic growth for the year with the international segment at 10.4% and Americas at 2.4%. 11:39 As mentioned, end-market demand increased considerably faster than we anticipated in 2021. And although we were able to deliver significantly more than our initial outlook, we were unable to meet the full market opportunity currently. However, our record backlogs will enable accelerated revenue in the future once the supply chain constraints are mitigated. 12:03 Please go to Slide number 8. Fourth quarter revenues for the Allegion Americas segment were 499.5 million, down 4.2% on a reported basis and 4.3% organically. The organic decline was driven by continued supply chain pressures for both mechanical and electronic products. 12:23 On the plus side, we did see sequential improvement in price and the Americas has announced another increase that goes into effect this month. We're driving price in all channels and products and our expectation is that pricing will exceed inflation in 2022. 12:40 The Americas non-residential business was up low single digits as strong price was offset by delayed volume, related to electronic allocations and other component shortages. These supply chain constraints paired with robust market demand, slowed the pace of revenue realization that led to historic levels of backlogs at the end of the year. 13:00 Americas residential was down mid-teens. Similar to last quarter and mentioned previously, the main drivers of the decrease are the prior year being inflated by channel refill coming out of the pandemic shutdowns experienced in Q2 2020, and the shortage of electronic components that primarily impact us in the DIY space of big box retail and e-commerce. 13:23 Electronics revenue was down low 20%, driven by continued shortages of electronic components in both the non-residential and residential businesses. The prior year residential channel refill also had an impact on year-over-year electronics performance. 13:39 Allegion Americas adjusted operating income of 105.5 million decreased 29% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter was down 740 basis points. The decrease was driven by inflationary pressures, productivity challenges related to supply chain, and volume de-leverage. Incremental investments had a 90 basis points dilutive impact on adjusted markets. 14:05 Although margins were down significantly in the quarter, down 370 basis points for the full-year, margins will improve in 2022, compared with 2021 from increased price realization, volume leverage, and improved business mix. 14:21 Please go to Slide number 9. The Allegion International segment had another solid quarter. Fourth quarter revenues were 209.7 million, up 1.7% and up 5.8% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by strength in our global portable security business along with good price realization. Reported growth reflecting impacts at currency headwinds and divestitures. 14:48 Allegion International adjusted operating income of 29.4 million decreased 11.2% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased by 200 basis points. The margin decrease was driven primarily by inflation exceeding price and productivity along with negative product mix, which more than offset the positive volume leverage. Incremental investments reduced margins by 50 basis points. 15:16 I would also note the full-year performance of the International segment, double-digit organic growth, and achievement of 11% operating margin. This was a record year for the segment and reflects a tremendous amount of effort and dedication by the entire team. 15:32 Please go to Slide number 10. Available cash flow for 2021 came in at 443 million, which is flat compared to the prior year period. The adjusted net earnings were slightly lower and was offset by slightly lower capital expenditures. In total, the working capital impact was near neutral with increased inventories offset by other components of working capital. 15:58 Looking at the working capital chart, it shows working capital as a percentage of revenues and the cash conversion cycle decreased based on a [4.25] [ph] average. 16:09 Last chart on the slide shows our net leverage. The net debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased from 1.5 last year to 1.7 this year. The increase in the ratio was driven primarily by reduced cash position from shareholder distributions for the year. 16:27 The business continues to generate strong cash flow and conversion of net earnings. We have a healthy balance sheet and we executed 542 million and shareholder distributions were 413 million in share repurchases and 129 million of dividends. We also recently announced a 14% increase in our dividend coming later in March. 16:51 During the quarter, we entered into a new 750 million unsecured credit agreement, consisting of a 250 million term facility, and a 500 million revolving facility. We obtained a rating upgrade with Moody's and a move to positive outlook by Fitch. Our capital structure is an asset of the company and we continue to execute on our balanced capital allocation strategy that will deploy capital through incremental, high returning organic investments, CapEx, M&A, or shareholder distributions. 17:25 I\u2019ll now hand it back over to Dave for some comments on 2022. Dave Petratis : 17:29 Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide 11. Before I get into our outlook for the year, I want to highlight actions we are taking to mitigate constraints and drive growth and profitability in 2022. 17:47 Our expectation is to fully cover inflation with price. We are in the midst of executing aggressive pricing actions across the globe in all product categories and all channels. We will remain vigilant during the year and we will not hesitate to pull the pricing lever if inflation headwinds increase further. 18:12 With regard to timing, we expect net margin pressures during the first half with the price versus cost dynamic improving sequentially throughout the year and turning positive in the middle of the year. 18:26 Our product redesigned and alternative sourcing work is expected to be completed by the end of Q2. This will help alleviate the supply chain pressures related to our mechanical business and provide access to additional electronic component solutions. However, electronic chip allocations will continue to be choppy throughout the year. As the supply chain normalizes, we will continuously improve our lead times and reduce our record backlog. 18:58 Our greatest strength lies in the people of Allegion. With broad tightness in the labor market, we are protecting our labor pipeline. We have implemented pay increases and are not flexing labor to the degree we normally would. This is operationally inefficient in the short-term, but when supply chains pressure ease, we want to be sure we have the labor in place to move product out of the factories and reduce backlogs. 19:30 We expect return to margin expansion this year. Second half margins are anticipated to perform stronger than first half, and we will exit the year on a path back to peak margin performance. We continue to invest in R&D and software development that progresses our seamless access strategy and to build critical talent capabilities and innovation. 19:55 Please go to Slide 12. For the 2022 outlook on revenue, the Americas is expected to strengthen our non-residential businesses with the continued recovery in those end markets, particularly education, healthcare, and commercial. All leading indicators are positive and the level of institutional specification for our business had continued to be strong. 20:22 Residential indicators are positive as well and we expect that business have continued growing in 2022. The under supply of single family homes continues to be corrected and the builder channel and retail point of sale has been strong for quite some time. Electronic and smart home adoption continues to be long-term growth drivers. 20:48 As underscored earlier, we are aggressively pursuing pricing in all channels, products in the Americas, and around the globe. Given the supply chain challenges that persist, we expect the revenue performance to be better in the second half than in the first, but still project organic revenue growth in all quarters. 21:09 With the strength in non-residential constructions, continued growth in residential, our expectation for electronic chip allocation and redesign work to ease supply chain pressures, we project total organic revenue in the Americas to be up 8.5% to 10% in 2022. 21:29 In the Allegion International segment, we expect growth, but we are starting to see some electronic supply chain issues in that region as well. Currency headwinds are projected to offset organic growth. 21:44 For Allegion International, we project total revenue to be in the minus 1% to plus 1% range with organic growth of 3% to 5%. All in for Allegion, we are projecting total revenue to be up 6% to 7.5% and organic revenue growth of 7% to 8.5%. Our 2022 outlook for adjusted earnings per share is $5.55 to $5.75. Timing [warrants] [ph], we expect to realize approximately 60% of the adjusted EPS in the second half of the year. 22:24 As indicated, adjusted operational earnings are expected to increase 14% to 18% driven by volume leverage and price exceeding inflation. Incremental investments continue to be a priority as we remain focused on accelerating electronics and seamless access growth in support of our vision and strategy. These incremental investments predominantly relate to added R&D and engineering to further develop, enhance, and accelerate new product development and software capabilities. 23:01 The combination of interest and other expenses is expected to be a headwind as some of the more favorable items that we experienced in 2021 are non-recurring. Our outlook assumes a full-year adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 13%. It also assumes outstanding weighted average diluted shares of approximately 88 million. 23:23 The outlook additionally includes approximately $0.05 per share for restructuring charges during the year. As a result, reporting EPS is projected to be $5.50 to $5.70. We are expecting our available cash flow for 2022 to be in the $465 million to $485 million range. 23:45 Please go to Slide 13. In summary, end market demand remains strong in the fourth quarter and we expect that to continue. The supply chain issues we are experiencing have hindered our ability to meet that demand, and as a result, we have built record backlogs that will support growth in 2022 and 2023. 24:10 The product redesigns and alternative sourcing should begin to alleviate some of the supply chain pressures by mid-year, primarily on the mechanical side of the business. We are projecting solid organic revenue growth of 7% to 805% in 2022, even with the expectation that chip allocations will continue to be tight. 24:33 We expect year-over-year growth in electronics and acceleration in that growth throughout the year. We are aggressively going after price across the globe and in all products and channels. For the calendar year, pricing will exceed inflation. This will help Allegion to deliver margin improvement, which we expect will progress as we go throughout the year. 24:58 Please go to Slide 14. A final note on some key leadership announcements before we move into Q&A. Mike Wagnes, who leads the Commercial Americas strategic business unit will be transitioning to the role of Chief Financial Officer on March 1. He succeeds Patrick Shannon, who will be retiring later this year. 25:22 As CFO, Mike brings significant financial experience and a deep understanding of our global business in the markets we serve. He has been with Allegion for 15 years and many of you know him from his time as Treasurer and leading Investor Relations. The Board of Directors and I have the utmost confident that he is the right person to step into this important role. 25:46 Dave Ilardi has been promoted to Senior Vice President of the Americas Segment effective March 1. Dave currently leads Allegion Home and is responsible for the flagship Schlage portfolio of residential solutions. He been at the company for 20 years and is highly respected, an industry veteran with extensive knowledge of our customers, channel partners, and vertical markets. We are thrilled to welcome him to the senior leadership team. 26:16 Allegion is equally fortunate to have a strong bench of talented leaders throughout the globe. They are well prepared to execute on our strategy and capitalize on growth opportunities as we emerge from the pandemic. And I want to thank our entire team for their commitment and dedication. 26:34 Last, a few remarks for Patrick Shannon. It has been a privilege to work alongside Patrick, who has been a partner, a friend for me, and an outstanding business leader. And as a family member of the leadership team, Patrick has been instrumental in refreshing our business strategy, building a world-class finance organization, and creating a strong foundation that will serve us well in the years ahead. I speak for all of the employees of Allegion, when I say that it has been an honor and a pleasure to [serve with] [ph] Patrick Shannon. 27:11 We'll now take your questions. Operator : 27:14 [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from [Brett Lindsay] [ph] from [indiscernible]. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : 27:41 Hi, good morning all and congrats to Patrick. Patrick Shannon : 27:44 Thank you. Unidentified Analyst : 27:45 Good. A strong outlook overall. I'm just curious what level of price are you expecting within the guide for the full-year? And any directional color you can give us between how you're thinking about the residential and non-residential piece within the Americas business for 2022? Patrick Shannon : 28:05 Yes. So, I would characterize as you look at price, again, good sequential improvement in Q4 of 2021. You will see continued improvement as we progress throughout 2022, both on the non-residential and residential side of business. It is a large component of our overall revenue growth kind of reaching a peak, if you will, in terms of price realization in Q3 as we realize the full implementation of all the price increases, including both list prices and surcharges on certain products. 28:43 So, a big part of the revenue growth and if you, kind of look at it relative to non-res, res, the non-resi in terms of our guide, full-year revenue growth, you'd be looking at the high-end, kind of low-double-digits, residential mid-single digit type of growth for 2022. Unidentified Analyst : 29:09 Okay, great. And then just to come back to the electronics, you noted growth year-over-year on a full-year basis, I'm just curious, what's the pacing look like through the year? Is it really Q3 until that turns positive again or does it happen earlier? Just curious what\u2019s your planning processes looks like there? Dave Petratis : 29:28 We've spent a lot of time looking at electronic chip and component allocations. And as you think about our guide, it will be \u2013 it will improve sequentially quarter-to-quarter in terms of the flow of electronic blocks and be strongest in the second half and as we move into 2023. Unidentified Analyst : 29:50 Okay, great. I'll pass it along. Thanks. Dave Petratis : 29:52 Thank you. Operator : 29:54 The next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : 29:59 Hi, good morning and thanks for all the help Patrick and wish you all the best. In terms of \u2013 my question would be around the underperformance of, sort of the volumes Allegion in the Americas relative to some of its biggest peers, that's clearly been a point of focus for investors for a few months now. So just wondered what you thought the main factors were behind that seeming share loss, particularly from a non-resi side, if it\u2019s simply a difference in kind of procurement and sourcing strategies? And is there anything else perhaps doing on more on the commercial or customer facing front as well? Dave Petratis : 30:46 I think you've got to call our second half as of is. Number 1, markets are incredibly strong. Number 2, our loss in opportunity by the company, because of supply chain difficulties. Our supply chains tend to be in region. They perform incredibly well giving high inventory turnover, high return on invested capital when they're working well. 31:16 The pandemic, especially as we move through 2022 was severely impacted by chips and labor shortages that affected our very complex supply chain within region. And when I say complex, you've heard me say Julian, complexity is our friend at Allegion, but when you throw that \u2013 those challenges in supply chain, you're really working a variety of issues, which I'd say stabilized as we ended December and will get sequentially better as we go on. 31:57 I would also say, some of the moves that we made pre-pandemic to vertically integrate actually helped us. And I think, I'm confident that we'll get the mechanical side of the Americas business straighten out its things like investing, investment capping that make the Von Duprin exit device what it is. And as we move through the year, the pacing item will be electronics. 32:30 We build our plan based on the allocations that we believe that we will get, and I believe in the electronics, the supply chain disruptions there have pulled demand forward and will benefit in the secondary markets that will help us exceed our plan in 2022, if that in fact impacts. So, a lot into that answer. I hope that gives you some color. Patrick Shannon : 33:00 Julian, I would also just add real quickly, when you look at, kind of the order activity on non-res, really strong, we're kind of giving indication, maybe similar what we're seeing from our peer set, just this inability to be able to ship and realize of revenue. So, we'll call it, kind of differed or delayed revenue, it will come. They\u2019re definitive orders. We're not seeing any cancellations. And that's why we're going to anticipate 2022 to have accelerated revenues we progress throughout the course of the year with the resolution of some of these supply chain difficulties. 33:40 The other thing is, on the residential side, keep in mind, we got a large channel load last year that's impacting negatively the comparisons year-over-year. So that has kind of the distortion. I mean, if you look at it on a two-year stack basis, it's not as pronounced as what you saw perhaps in Q4 2021. So, just kind of keep those things in mind if you would. Julian Mitchell : 34:08 Thanks a lot. That's very helpful. And then just one very quick follow-up. Just [on kind of] [ph] final point on the, sort of the price volume split within the organic sales guide for total company 2022, is this the sort of rough assumption that the organic sales growth is split sort of 50/50 price and volume? Patrick Shannon : 34:28 Yes, I'd say that's pretty much in the ballpark. Again, we're going to push the price lever and because right now, as the numbers would indicate, underwater relative to the inflation we've seen, but I think that's a decent assumption. Julian Mitchell : 34:49 Great. Thank you. Operator : 34:52 The next question comes from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe O'Dea: 34:57 Hi, good morning. First, just a cadence question. You gave some helpful details in terms of how you're thinking about the back half of the year, but I think with the fluidity of the current environment, just anything that you're able to talk about in terms of the first half? I think, first quarter EPS tends to be maybe a high teens percentage of the full-year. Just trying to understand based on the visibility you have on supply chain, what kind of progression we should be thinking about, kind of as we go first quarter and the second quarter if you're able to talk about that? Patrick Shannon : 35:31 I think, we gave you a [nugget] [ph] there, 60% of the EPS will be in the second half of the year. Second, you know you think about the labor ramp up that I think is happening for us [Technical Difficulty] see people are coming back to work, back into the factories, that momentum is important for us to drive the supply chain to meet this, you know the demand and backlog that we've got to drive through. 36:03 The second would be chip supplies, sequentially they'll get better quarter-to-quarter and it leads to that back half being stronger. Dave Petratis : 36:12 I would just add, seasonally, Q1 normally our weakest quarter from a revenue perspective and earnings. The year-over-year decline in margin not as pronounced. Obviously is what you saw in Q4, but yet margin down relative to Q4 just from a seasonal perspective, that's kind of normal course of business, but as we progress throughout the course of the year, the price cost dynamic, you will see continuous improvement beginning in Q1, relative to Q4, and that will progress throughout the course of the year, as we get more price realization and our assumption is, on inflation that, we've kind of plateaued where we are and actually steel is, if you kind of look at on a [cold role] [ph] per ton basis has come down a little bit, maybe a little opportunity there. But margin expansion really back-end loaded where that price cost dynamic becomes very favorable. 37:20 And obviously, we have easier comps, back half of this year, compared to 2021. So, that's kind of how we see it playing out sequentially. Joe O'Dea: 37:32 I appreciate that. And then I wanted to ask about some of the commentary 2022, but also constructive on 2023 in terms of the conversations that you're having with customers and the amount of backlog that's even scheduled for 2023, but you can just expand on that a little bit in terms of, kind of what you're seeing to help kind of build what would be, kind of a two year constructive outlook on improving demand? Patrick Shannon : 38:03 So, we certainly filtered through the macroeconomic indicators, which we feel all positive all levels. I think as you travel around the country, you see the strength in construction markets. You've got stimulus coming from the top, you also are working through the backlog of work that was disrupted by the pandemic. So, as I think about [K through 12] [ph] hospitals, multi-family, and the overall res, which drives expansion, I feel very good about the next couple of years. Dave Petratis : 38:47 I would also add, we've talked about this record backlog, both on the mechanical electronics, we\u2019ll have an opportunity to work through a lot of the mechanical backlog in 2022. There's still going to be an overhang, if you will, or excess elevated backlog associated with electronic products going into 2023. And so, with that backdrop and their continued strength and market demand, would expect 2023 to be \u2013 have a pretty robust organic revenue growth as well for the Americas region on non-res and really good electronics growth year-over-year. So, would expect that to, kind of continue on, compared to 2022. Joe O'Dea: 39:35 Thank you. Operator : 39:37 The next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow. Please go ahead. David MacGregor : 39:43 Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of quick ones, maybe Dave, you could talk about the backlogs and in the past, you've indicated a disinclination to want to put through pricing on backlogs as you protect some of the spec business that you've [booked] [ph]. I'm just wondering if that's changing now as you think about becoming more aggressive on pricing into 2022? And then obviously great results from Europe under some pretty difficult circumstances there as well, clearly Tim and his team are executing well there. Can you just talk about one of the biggest pieces of the 2022, 2023 margin progression opportunity in Europe? Thank you. Dave Petratis : 40:20 So, I'll talk about international first. I think Tim, our Allegion Home, Europe, SimonsVoss, Interflex, the [Australian business] [ph], great focus of execution in 2021 in the phase of the pandemic. The consolidation that we drove a year ago and announced in combining that did a couple of things. One, simplify their structure. We cleaned up some bits of the portfolio, but Tim's knowledge of the capabilities of America accelerated capabilities that we have here into those markets. It's things like diligence. 41:02 It's things like our electronic software platforms and a belief that some of that product platforms that we're having advanced development can be extended and help us compete. So, I think, when I think about Allegion International that we pulled that off in a pandemic year, is some work that's been going on at Allegion for a couple of years, and it came to our head, and I think our best days are ahead of us. 41:31 I think, in terms of margin expansion, I think the long-term goal would be to be a margin equal or better than [ASSA] in the competitive markets. We're not apples to apples in terms of how we compete, extremely strong in the electronics and then you get more into the regional market forces and what those markets allow where we're competing. 41:59 The second part of the question was? Patrick Shannon : 42:00 Yes. So, David, on the pricing associated with the backlog, keep in mind, industry standard normally when you give a quote, on a project based job or and/or you have an order in-house prior to the price going into effect, you kind of honor that. 42:24 So, normally, there's a time lag between when you announce a price increase and the realization and that could be, we'll call it on average, 90 days to 120 days type of time timeframe. And so, that's why relative to the price increases, we've already implemented and are executing. You don't get to a full run rate realization that we'll call at Q3, but normally you don't go back and reprice quotes and backlog. 42:55 Okay. That's a consistency, kind of in our industry. Now, we have looked at other parts of the business and doing that, but predominantly it\u2019s protected. David MacGregor : 43:09 Is there any way you can update that 80 million to 100 million of backlog number that you gave us last quarter, just to indicate where you think that is today? Patrick Shannon : 43:16 So, it exceeded or increased compared to Q3, just kind of given the surge and order activity. Now, some of that and it's difficult to characterize would be a pull forward from 2022 activity when customers are just trying to get to orders at and get in-line for the products, but increased and I would say, if you're, kind of looking at the full-year revenue impact on Allegion north of 100 million would be how to think about it. David MacGregor : 43:53 Thanks very much, gentlemen. Patrick Shannon : 43:55 Thank you. Operator : 43:56 The next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : 44:02 Good morning. Dave Petratis : 44:03 Good morning. Andrew Obin : 44:04 Hey, guys. Just trying to understand how much overlap is there between your supply chain and the supply chain of your competitors? i.e. just sort of ability to compensate for the fact that it sounds you underestimated the strength of the demand and sort of catch up when the competitors already have sort of slots [on the line] [ph] or is that not an issue? Patrick Shannon : 44:26 I don't believe there's little overlap. You know, look at Von Duprin devices and look at [indiscernible] whatever brand go market with, significant differences on the mechanical side, different [indiscernible] came out of San Francisco. I mean, there's just differences. I think there's also advantages, disadvantages, also out of scale, something we're not shy of. 45:00 A bigger electronic expense would may give us some advantage. I think when I look at the performance of [ourself] [ph] in 2021, I\u2019m humbled and I would say, it's a strong reflection of the opportunity out there in the marketplace for approach. Andrew Obin : 45:16 Yes, we can figure up, I was seeing more on the electronics side, but that makes a lot of sense. And another question, sort of, look you guys have been fairly conservative with the balance sheet usage, particularly on the technology side, you have a lot of, sort of things incubating inside, but the valuations out there are a lot more favorable than they were a year ago. How do you think about strategic opportunities post the sell-off, and I would imagine there are more sort of desperate buyers/sellers than they were a year ago? How does that look for you? Dave Petratis : 45:51 So, I'd say, number one, on the software electronic seamless access side of this, our software stacks that support expanding access, capabilities to customers have never been stronger. We've invested through the pandemic and our ability to bring in visitor management and schools or capacity flow through a building or solving problems and verticals where there's multifamily K through 12, those software stacks are critical, and I believe we're in a leadership position. 46:32 Two is, the valuations are softening. We will be opportunistic on both. You've got to have one leg in the mechanical world and one foot at least in the seamless access world, and we're ready to deploy capital in both that in areas that extend our value proposition and advance our position and seamless access around K through 12 multifamily and hospitals, and we\u2019ve never have been in a better position to do it Andrew. Andrew Obin : 47:06 Great and congratulations to Patrick. Thanks a lot. Operator : 47:10 The next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : 47:17 Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Dave Petratis : 47:19 Good morning. Jeff Sprague : 47:21 Just kind of come back to price cost and also Dave your comment about, kind of glide back to prior peak. When you're talking about recovering inflations fully in 2022, is that kind of accumulative inflation burden that you've taken through this entire episode or are we just speaking about 2022 specifically? And really the nature of my question ties back to the glide path comment, you know your revenues here in 2022 look like there'll be 12% or 13% above 2020 and the margins are 100 bps below 2020, 100 bps below 2019. So, maybe you could just kind of bridge us a little bit more back to where you think you're [normally] [ph] heading here? Patrick Shannon : 48:10 Yes. So, on the price cost dynamic, the commentary relative to 2022 is margin accretive, obviously. Pricing exceeding inflation cost. And then when you add productivity, we're in the positive territory there, margin accretive. If you look at it over a two-year basis, net positive, okay, but down on margin, and you understand obviously the math on this. You can offset inflation, but it's not enough to, kind of cover your normal margin profile. So, pressure there. 48:51 When I look forward to 2023, you've got continued growth in the business. So, you can have volume leverage there. Assuming inflation is normalized, we carryover a price improvement there, plus any incremental pricing improvements would be additive. And then, you just have the normal leverage on the business, plus business mix should be favorable as well. 49:18 So, kind of looking forward, past 2022, glide path to peak margin performance from an overall Allegion perspective, you heard Dave talk about the improvement in the international segment, leveraging corporate spend etcetera, I think it puts Allegion in a good position to be a peak margin performance, and hopefully by the end of 2023 and going into 2024. Dave Petratis : 49:45 I'd add one other, as I think about pricing versus pre-pandemic, we are increasing product \u2013 pricing on our residential products and we'll make sure that we true that element of our portfolio as well. Jeff Sprague : 50:03 And could you just speak to, I mean, obviously everyone is dealing with supply chain issues, but the key competitor does seem to be fairing a little bit better, is there any, kind of dis-slippage in, kind of distribution posture with key distributors or in retail, where you're kind of, for like a better term, I guess stocking out and kind of losing shelf space? Dave Petratis : 50:32 I'd say, my reaction is no, not losing shelf space. I think, one is, when I think about ASSA, they would run with significantly more inventory Allegion versus ASSA. It's a different model, but if we would typically run with $400 million, $500 hundred worth of inventory, they are 4x or 5x bigger on that. So, you got to bigger math. They have to drive that on a global basis. 51:02 I think their electronics position is particularly driven by HID [indiscernible] advantage there. With that said, we worked extremely hard to adapt our supply chain. Again, I talked about the velocity we get through that supply chain in a normal time. We were hit by the electronics, investment casting some extrusion, the mechanical side easier for us to go in effect. The electronics as we think about our guide, allocations equal to the guide, if electronics improved, which I see some bricks. 51:42 We're going to sell more electronic [indiscernible] to be good for Allegion. As I think about lack of shelf space, Jeff, you know as well as I do. If you're \u2013 if the installer needs it today, and you can't provide that, it goes to the competition. And I'm confident we have faced some of that. I'm confident that we will regain whatever we lost. Jeff Sprague : 52:09 Great. And maybe just one housekeeping question. Wages came up a couple of times. Can you just give us a sense of, kind of labor \u2013 direct labor as a percent of COGS or however you'd want to frame it for us just to have the perspective on that? Patrick Shannon : 52:24 So, if you look at it relative to the gross profit, it's a low piece of the overall product manufacturing cost. Wage rates have increased here. We're competitive in the marketplace and so what you're seeing across the board, we would participate in that relative to the increases. I\u2019m sure we're competitive and attracting and retaining good talent. Dave Petratis : 52:50 I would just add, especially in the major sites, our goal is that, Allegion to be that shiny manufacturer on the hill, great benefits, great wages, great opportunity to develop, one of the safest workforces in the world, and a place where people can engage and grow. Jeff Sprague : 53:08 Great. Thanks. Patrick, congratulations. Enjoy retirement. Mike, congrats. Patrick Shannon : 53:13 Sure. Tom Martineau : 53:14 Just a reminder, if we could just have one question and a very short follow-up if possible just to ensure we get everybody in. Operator : 53:21 The next question comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Walsh : 53:27 Hi, good morning and congrats to Patrick and Mike both. I guess just for my one question here, as we think about the margins for the two segments and I appreciate we're not going to get, kind of quarterly detail here, but would you expect both of them to kind of lever at a normal type incremental back half of the year? Is there any kind of divergence between the two of them as we think about the margin growth opportunity for both segments in 2022? Thank you. Dave Petratis : 54:06 Yes, I would say the international segment would be on a more normalized basis, and obviously didn't see the pressure that the Americas region in 2021. And so, your question is specific to the back half of the year. Americas would lever more than what you would normally see, again because of the price cost dynamic, becoming much more positive there, and the efficiencies from a manufacturing perspective as we work through some of these supply chain constraints. 54:38 Now, they will have much better leverage because productivity will be a lot better and then, kind of leveraging on the SG&A cost base. So, higher incrementals in the back half of the year, and you would expect that just kind of given the dynamics of where we are today. John Walsh : 54:58 Great. I'll just leave it at the one question there. Appreciate it. Operator : 55:03 The next question comes from Josh Chan from Baird. Please go ahead. Josh Chan : 55:08 Good morning, Dave, Patrick, Tom. Best wishes Patrick in your retirement. Patrick Shannon : 55:14 Thanks, Josh. Josh Chan : 55:16 I guess my one question based on your comments about raw materials and steel maybe be coming down a little bit and your, kind of how costs flow through your P&L, when do you expect to, sort of hit peak raw material costs, if you will, prior to steal maybe benefiting you a bit later on? Dave Petratis : 55:39 So, we're currently at peak costs right now. That will kind of carry forward into Q1, you know Q2 it starts to level off relative to prior year comparison, but just a quick reminder, even with the market costs being lower today than what it was well say in early to Q4, we don't see the benefit of that roll into our numbers, maybe 3 months to 6 months later, just kind of basis of how we manage our supply chain and entering into contracts with average prices and those type of things. 56:22 So, kind of like the pricing dynamic, there's always a lag relative to market. And so, would expect if they retain here some of that to flow through, we'll call it in Q3. Josh Chan : 56:38 Great. And I appreciate the color and good luck in 2022. Dave Petratis : 56:43 Thank you. Operator : 56:44 The next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : 56:50 Hi, good morning guys and congrats to Patrick and Mike both. Just maybe first question on the supply chain side, you guys had talked about a lot about chip shortage, but I guess, maybe just kind of zooming out the bulk of the portfolio really is mechanical versus electrified, like any other pieces of supply chain that are still, kind of jump [indiscernible] for 2022 that we should think about or will a lot of that throttling really be determined by chips? Dave Petratis : 57:22 We have, what I would describe as more control over that mechanical supply chain have been able to move faster and to develop alternative sources wherever that could come from the world. Again, I'd say a lot of our U.S. mechanical supply chain is based [in region] [ph]. And again, the mitigating moves that we made, I think are substantially more operational execution than the chip side of it. Josh Pokrzywinski : 58:00 Got it. And then just quick follow-up to want to make sure I heard you right, Patrick, on the return to prior peak margins. It was an exit rate for 2023, not a full-year comment? I know, it\u2019s sort of silly like sitting here in early 2022, but just making sure I understood you right? Patrick Shannon : 58:16 So, first of all, what I did mention is, exit rate 2022, kind of, if you kind of go back to, we'll call it more of a normalized margin profile, Q4 this year 2022 is going to look pretty good. So, feel good about that. As we progress throughout 2023, we could be back as a total company, Allegion peak margin. Again, a lot of inputs there and factors, kind of playing into that and things could change, but so if you were in a good trajectory for 2023 for peak margin for the full-year, Americas will still have some wood to chop, kind of get back to peak margins, but we're working at. Dave Petratis : 59:04 I want to make one more comment to make sure I'm clear on the electronics side of this. The team, our engineering resources have done a great job adapting and developing second sources for electronic chips, particularly in some of our newest locks, those chips are in high demand in the external market. 59:31 So, things like our exit devices, those chips, maybe more options on the market than some of the things like the incurred plus that are right on the cutting edge. Josh Pokrzywinski : 59:45 Appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : 59:49 The next question comes from Chris Snyder from UBS. Please go ahead. Chris Snyder : 59:54 Thank you. Actually just wanted to follow-up on those prior comments around chip procurement. Can you maybe talk where the company is in terms of sourcing alternative suppliers? And at this point, is the chip constraint more of a revenue headwind in that, you cannot get the chips or is it more of a margin headwind and that the chips can get from alternative suppliers are running at a higher cost? Dave Petratis : 60:18 I would say, the chip constraints are our revenue headwind. If we could get more, we could some more. And I\u2019m encouraging you take a look at our new [indiscernible] plus, it's the first touch to tap lock on the market. It's constraint. It's got some of the newest chip technologies, battery savings, energy savings, you like it, but it's constraint. 60:48 The second part of your question? Chris Snyder : 60:53 I think that answered. I guess my follow-up question was actually, would be on pricing methodology. Obviously in the current market where availability matters more than price, you can push pretty hard, but how do you guys determine or how do you gauge like what's the sustainable level? How much can we put in Q1 2022 that that could sustain through 2022 because it sounds like the assumption is that availability across the supply chain improves throughout the year? Dave Petratis : 61:21 I think in the [indiscernible] quote market, we're testing that market. We're testing that pricing every day. So, two price increases in 2021 in the commercial institutional, another coming out. So, we're raising list prices. We're making sure we're capturing our freight, but in the bid \u2013 in the quote bid order procurement phase of that, it\u2019s been tested everyday by the marketplace, are you winning or losing and whether it's a bit of an auction market, but we're living that every day. On the residential side, we're going to be strong and stand-up from the inflationary forces that are impacting our products and not give away some of the furnished products on the [plan] [ph] in terms of residential security. Patrick Shannon : 62:18 And, Chris, I'll just add to your question on the product redesign and alternative sourcing strategy, making really good progress. It impacts a lot of products throughout our product portfolio. The expectation is, the majority of it will be completed and executed by the end of the second quarter. 62:41 It\u2019s kind of phased in throughout a little bit this quarter, most of it Q2, which will help us alleviate and start getting more product into the channel or customers, etcetera and higher growth rates organically. And so \u2013 and to start working down the backlog. Chris Snyder : 63:03 Appreciate all the color. Thank you. Operator : 63:06 The next question comes from Brian Ruttenbur from Imperial Capital. Please go ahead. Brian Ruttenbur : 63:12 Yes. Just real quick. I had a number of questions. So, I'm going to hit you with, maybe the easiest one. The total price increases that you had in 2021, can you give us a range, was it on the low of 5% up to [20] [ph]? Can you give us a range on where prices went in 2021 and where you anticipate those to go in 2022, overall in terms of the ranges of price increases you had on your products? Dave Petratis : 63:39 You know, I would say characterize it as a wide range, different product segments get different price increases, you know residential, non-residential is different. Even within non-nonresidential, our hollow metal door business for example has surcharges attached to it, which would be higher than it\u2019s specific to steel, but list price increases maybe is what you're more at asking for. 64:07 I'd say, we're competitive with the market relative to the increases we've already announced and implemented in the market, and then another increase this month as well, pretty sizable, but remember, it's less price and as always discounts off a list price of the key item here is what you end up realizing and that number will continue to accelerate reaching a peak in Q3 of this year. Brian Ruttenbur : 64:36 Okay. Just as a follow-up to clarify that, since you didn't mention any specific numbers, the market as I hear it is around 15% increases, is that the right markets that I'm hearing that you're talking about? Dave Petratis : 64:50 I'd say, again, it depends what you're talking about. That to me sounds like there's a lot of surcharges baked into that number. That is not in aggregate, kind of the list price on your traditional mechanical electronic business. Brian Ruttenbur : 65:08 Thank you. Patrick Shannon : 65:09 So, let me \u2013 specifically with hollow metal steel doors, you could easily be in that zip code or more. But there's a wide range of SKUs here and we're in a \u2013 a lot of it's been [indiscernible] where we're competing every day, but prices are up. Brian Ruttenbur : 65:33 Thank you. Operator : 65:36 This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Dave Petratis for any closing remarks. Dave Petratis : 65:46 To wrap up the main things you heard today, demand remains robust and leading indicators are positive. We're working through the supply chain challenges, which are expected to improve, but we still see some pressure in electronics. 66:01 We will get the price cost equation back to positive this year and we expect to deliver organic growth of 7% to 8.5%, adjusted EPS of 7% to 11%, and high cash conversion in 2022. The long term fundamentals of Allegion remains strong and we are well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities and we\u2019ll return to peak performance as conditions normalize. Thank you, and have a great day. Operator *: 66:30 The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Please note this event is being recorded.  I'd now like to turn the conference over to Tom Martineau, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead. Tom Martineau : Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Allegion's first quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mike Wagnes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and the presentation which we will refer to in today's call, are available on our website at investor.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.  Please go to slides two and three. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our most recent SEC filings for description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.  Today's presentation and commentary include non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details.  Dave and Mike will now discuss our first quarter 2022 results, which will be followed by a Q&A session. Please, for the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and one short follow-up and then reenter the queue. We would like to give everyone an opportunity given the time allotted.  Please go to slide four and I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave Petratis : Thanks, Tom. Good morning. And thank you for joining us today. We had a solid start to 2022. Overall, market demand remains strong and our organic growth and pricing action accelerated. We also announced on Friday the acquisition of the Stanley Access Technologies business, a highly strategic acquisition for Allegion, which is expected to close in the third quarter of this year.  During Q1, we experienced robust demand on the non-residential side of the Americas, as well as strength in SimonsVoss, Interflex, and Portable Security within the International segment. Residential markets in the Americas remain stable. We have made progress on our product redesigns and alternative sourcing similar to the last two quarters, but were not able to fully meet the strong demand due to continued supply chain constraints. We did deliver good revenue growth in the quarter, driven primarily by price. The continued strength in demand is encouraging.  With regard to the supply chain constraints, we expect electronic component challenges to persist and the latest lockdowns in China are likely going to impact global supply chains even further.  Looking at price versus cost, we continue to experience high inflationary impacts from material cost, labor and freight. Price realization accelerated in Q1 and was the driver of organic growth in the quarter. With the recent spike in commodity prices, we have already announced additional price increases to take effect starting in Q2 across residential and non-residential markets, and we'll assess the need for further price increases as inflationary pressures continue.  As we discussed in February, we are aggressively pursuing price across all products and in all channels to offset unprecedented inflation, and we expect price to exceed inflation further for the year.  We are providing an updated outlook for 2022. We're raising our revenue outlook to reflect higher price, offsetting the additional inflation we're experiencing. We're holding our prior EPS range, and I'll share more detail on the outlook later in the presentation.  Last, on the business review, I want to further highlight our announcement from last Friday. We have come to an agreement to acquire Access Technologies business from Stanley Black & Decker. This is the right asset for Allegion and it progresses our seamless access strategic focus, adding a category leader with an expansive service footprint. The business has a strong financial profile and is very complementary to the Allegion Americas core business and our portfolio. Close is anticipated in Q3. And we welcome the Access Technology employees, and we look forward to all of them joining our team.  Now let's turn to the quarter performance for more details. Please go to slide 5. Revenue for the first quarter was $724 million, an increase of 4.2% compared to last year. Organic revenue growth was 6.4%. The organic revenue increase in the quarter was driven by significant price realization of 6%.  Allegion International and Allegion Americas non-residential business also saw volume growth, driven by robust demand highlighted earlier. Americas residential volumes were down as that business had a tough comparable to last year, a drip attributed to the large channel load during Q1 of 2021. Mike will share more detail on the business segments in a moment. Adjusted operating margin decreased by 240 basis points in the first quarter. Continued inflationary pressures, productivity challenge, and currency headwinds drove most of the decrease. Incremental investments for future growth caused 60 basis points of the decline.  Adjusted earnings per share of $1.07 decreased $0.13 or approximately $0.11 versus the prior. Lower operating income, a year-over-year tax rate increase and reduced other income was partially offset by favorable share count. Year-to-date available cash flow came in at $12 million, which was down 89% versus Q1 of last year, but is in line with our historical trends. Last year's high number was driven by lower working capital requirements due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As I've stated before, I firmly believe our vision and strategy in support of seamless access is more relevant than ever, and the Access Technology acquisition will add momentum. We remain bullish on construction and DIY markets for 2022 and continue to expect the trend of electronic adaption to fuel growth for many years.  Mike will now walk you through the financials, and I'll be back to discuss our 2022 outlook. Mike Wagnes : Thanks, Dave. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call.  Please go to slide number 6. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter of 2021, reported earnings per share was $1.18. Adjusting $0.02 for charges related to restructuring expenses, the 2021 adjusted earnings per share was $1.20. Favorable share count increased earnings by $0.03 per share and the impact of acquisition and divestitures drove another $0.01 per share. Higher year-over-year tax rate reduced earnings by $0.02 per share and the combination of interest and other income drove another $0.03 reduction. Investment spending had a $0.04 per share drag on earnings as we continue to invest in the business to fuel long-term growth, expand our electronics capabilities, and drive our seamless access strategy. Operational results decreased earnings per share by $0.08, driven by significant inflation, productivity challenges associated with supply chain pressures and unfavorable currency, which more than offset the favorable impacts of price. This results in adjusted first quarter 2022 earnings per share of $1.07, a decrease of $0.13 or 10.8% compared to the prior year. Lastly, we have a $0.02 per share reduction for the net of a non-operating gain and charges related to restructuring and acquisition costs.  After giving effect to these items, you arrive at the first quarter 2022 reported earnings per share of $1.05.  Please go to slide 7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue performance for the quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides.  As indicated, we had 6.4% organic revenue growth in the first quarter, driven by improved price realization. Although the company's volume was essentially flat, we did see strength in Allegion International and the Allegion Americas non-residential business. Currency headwind and divestitures more than offset the impact of acquisitions, bringing the total reported growth to 4.2% in the first quarter. Please go to slide number 8. First quarter revenue for the Americas segment was $528.2 million, up 5.9% on both a reported and an organic basis. The segment delivered significant price realization. Non-residential price was strong and residential business experience improved price realization.  The price helped the non-residential business grow low-double digits. Residential was down mid-single digit against a tough comparable from last year's channel load in, which drove Q1 of 2021 to be up low 20s percent. Electronics revenue was up low-single digits as component shortages continued to dampen our growth.  Americas adjusted operating income of $123.9 million decreased 8.6% versus the prior-year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter was down 370 basis points. The Q1 margin performance was a sequential improvement for the Americas as we expect to see further improvements as we progress through the year. The decrease in margin was driven by continued inflationary pressures, productivity challenges associated with supply chain shortages and volume deleverage. Incremental investments had a 60 basis point impact on margins as well.  Please go to slide 9. First quarter revenue for our International segment was $195.4 million, flat to last year and up 7.6% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by strength in SimonsVoss, Interflex and Global Portable Securities businesses. The segment also saw solid price realization contributing to the organic growth. The strong organic growth was offset by unfavorable currency and divestitures.  International adjusted operating income of $20.4 million increased 13.3% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margins for the quarter increased by 120 basis points to 10.4%. The margin increase was primarily driven by price and productivity exceeding inflation, as well as solid volume leverage, which more than offset currency and the 50 basis point headwind due to investment spending. Please go to slide 10. Year-to-date available cash flow for the first quarter of 2022 came in at $11.8 million, which is a decrease of more than $93 million compared to the prior-year period. The $11.8 million is more in line with historical trends as the business tends to have modest cash flows in the first quarter of a typical year.  Last year's spike in cash flow was driven primarily by lower working capital needs due to COVID. The business continues to generate strong cash flow and we remain committed to efficient and effective use of working capital. The amount of available cash generated in the first quarter was as expected and the balance sheet continues to be in a healthy position. We expect to use excess cash generated during the remainder of the year to pay down short-term debt taken on to complete the acquisition of the Stanley Access Technologies business.  I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full-year 2022 outlook. Dave Petratis : Thank you, Mike. Please go to slide number 11. Non-residential market demand in Americas continues to be robust. All leading indicators are positive and the level of institutional specifications continues to be strong. The residential business is stable and the under-supply of homes over the last decade will continue to be a factor driving growth in the residential segment.  We have been aggressive in pursuing price in all channels and products and saw substantial improvement in price realization in Q1. We have announced additional price increases to go in effect starting in Q2. Given the continued supply chain challenges, we still expect the revenue performance to be better in the second half than in the first half. With these parameters in place, we are raising the outlook and are now projecting total inorganic revenue in the Americas to be up 10% to 11.5% in 2022. In Allegion International, markets have remained solid, led by our Germanic and Global Portable Security business. The International segment also experienced sequential improvement in price realization, as we are pursuing price aggressively in those markets as well. Currency headwinds will continue to reduce total growth.  For Allegion International, we are raising our outlook for total revenue growth to 0.5% to 2%, with organic growth of 5% to 6.5%. All in, for total Allegion, we're raising the total revenue growth outlook to a range of 7.5% to 9% and organic revenue to increase 8.5% to 10%. These increases to prior outlook are driven primarily by higher price realization. It's important to note this updated outlook does not include any impacts from the Stanley Access Technology acquisition.  Please go to slide number 12. For EPS, we are holding to the ranges provided during our last earnings call. Reported EPS is expected to be $5.50 to $5.70 per share with an adjusted EPS range of $5.55 to $5.75 as the increased revenue from the additional price realization is offset by higher inflationary cost.  The outlook continues to assume a full-year adjusted tax rate of approximately 13% and the share count assumption has been updated to approximately 88.5 million. The unfavorable impact of the higher share count assumption is offset by operational improvements, leading us to hold the prior EPS outlook. Our outlook for available cash flow is being raised and it's now projected to be $470 million to $490 million.  Please go to slide 14. Before we go to Q&A, I want to talk a bit more about our acquisition of the Access Technologies business. For those of you who have missed Friday's conference call, I invite you to visit our website and listen to the archived webcast.  I want to repeat the benefits we saw in this acquisition. It's a highly strategic combination that expands our presence in security markets and unlocks greater values for our employees, customers, distributors and shareholders.  We will bolster our geographic leadership in Allegion Americas through complementary verticals and further penetrate our markets with complementary products and service offerings. Cross-selling opportunities will create more room for mutual growth, and we will enhance and expand a service business that drives customer value in automatic entrance solutions, providing ongoing and consistent revenue streams.  Allegion will significantly expand its breadth of access, egress and access control solutions. In return, the Access Technology business will gain specification and institutional market expertise, strong new end user and architectural relationships and distribution networks as well as additional resources from Allegion.  Along with Allegion's strong balance sheet, significant cash flow and disciplined capital allocation, we believe it will create a stronger financial profile, a stronger value proposition and new opportunities that enhance shareholder value.  Please go to slide 15. As we look at this acquisition, we believe there are many ways to deliver on our promise to create value for Allegion shareholders. We're creating value with a more comprehensive portfolio of solutions, adding a category leader and addressing a current portfolio gap in Allegion's core businesses. We're also adding North American service capabilities to grow seamless access in a connected world.  The acquisition of Access Technologies business is the right opportunity for us. It expands our innovation and electronic capabilities, brings a strong business with good market fundamentals, and complements the core markets and specification expertise of our Allegion Americas segment. We believe the acquisition will strengthen our financial profile. It provides clear synergy and incremental revenue opportunities. A balanced and disciplined capital allocation strategy will continue to be a top priority for Allegion and having a strong balance sheet and cash flow to maintain financial flexibility that supports that.  Ultimately, we believe the automatic entrance solution and service business are a strategic investment that supports seamless access, and the Access Technology acquisition will create value for our shareholders. We're excited to welcome the business and its people to the Allegion family. With that, Mike and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Timothy Wojs from Baird. Timothy Wojs : Let's jump on the quarter. Maybe just to talk a little bit about what you're seeing from an order and kind of a backlog perspective. How are you kind of thinking about the revenue cadence as you kind of think through the year, I'm just trying to kind of understand the visibility that you've got to the back half of the year and what you're building in for any risks that maybe the building timelines might elongate just from a construction timeline perspective and maybe shift some revenue into 2023. Dave Petratis : I think as we think about the path forward in terms of order activity, incoming orders, especially in the commercial business, institutional business, extremely robust. And as I've been traveling around the last few weeks, you also get that feel that construction activity across the country, extremely robust. As we look at our macroeconomics, it says, in the commercial, institutional, we're beginning the upcycle, which says we're going to get stronger as we go through the year in terms of product out the door. I would say supply chains remain under pressure, but have improved from the second half of last year. And then, I think you've got to think about res. When I think about res, it probably shows my age a little bit. Residential was extremely difficult in the last decade. And as I think about the under-supply of housing across the nation, I think we're going to continue to bang out 1.2 million to 1.6 million, even with higher interest rates. So, I feel very good about overall demand. I think about that going out four to six quarters and then we'll see. Timothy Wojs : I think in the prior guidance, just on the EPS cadence, Mike, I think it was kind of 60% weighted to the back half. Is there any difference to that today just given kind of where you are in the first quarter or is that kind of similar? Mike Wagnes : Tim, as you think about it, we got off to a decent start. Right? I would say it doesn't move materially from that 60% that we said at the beginning of the year. First quarter was okay or stronger than maybe the original assumption assumed. And so, it could move a percent or so or two, but it's roughly around that 60% that we gave in the beginning of the year. Timothy Wojs : Is there any change to kind of the price cost assumptions on a dollar basis for the year? Mike Wagnes : I would say as you look at our guide, we raised our guide on the top line, didn't raise the guide on the EPS because that is price realization that is fighting the inflationary pressures. And so, there will be a higher percentage going to price than we assumed in the beginning of the year. So, if in the beginning of the year, we said roughly 50/50, that's going to be higher by the raise of the guide. So, you're going to be looking at that 60% to 65%. Operator : Our next question comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse. John Walsh : Nice quarter. Just kind of wanted to understand the change in the sales guidance. So, sounds like it's being driven by price, but what kind of gave you the confidence to take it higher, given that supply chains were still tough. You have the China COVID impacts. I understand that demand is really robust and you have the strong backlog, but kind of what gave you the confidence that you'll be able to get the parts you need to kind of hit a higher top line. Mike Wagnes : John, as you think about our \u2013 so the price, we feel really strong. We've announced those increases already. So, they're in the marketplace.  With respect to the overall market demand, even stronger than when we exited Q4. So Q1, real strong market demand in non-residential. And then lastly, we've taken actions to qualify additional suppliers and to work on bringing in new supply base. Those activities have gained traction in the first quarter. And so, that does give us confidence that, in the back half of the year, we'll get additional supply from additional suppliers that we can get more volume out. Dave Petratis : I'd add to it as well. Versus the second half of last year, labor has improved in its availability, freight has improved modestly. And I say modestly, the rise in COVID in China, the lockdowns will have some implications. We've got some exposure, but it's not major. And I think particular on the mechanical inputs to our business, redesign, qualifying second suppliers has really strengthened our confidence. That leaves the electronics element. As we think about going forward and our guide, that's based on allocations. If chip availability gets better across the board, we'll be even stronger. John Walsh : I guess just thinking about some of the moving pieces with the margins, I know before we were thinking Americas should see better than normal just on mix and volume recovery. Obviously, we have the higher inflation that's getting passed through. But could you just maybe help calibrate either total Allegion level or within Americas kind of what you're thinking the incremental margins will be for the year or however you'd like to talk to it? Mike Wagnes : John, as you think about Q1, sequential improvement versus what you saw in the fourth quarter, we'll expect to see improvements each quarter sequentially, such that the back half, you start to really see that margin expansion versus the prior year. So, sequential improvement and then expansion in the back half. And then, when you model it, just take into account that there's substantial inflationary pressures. We're driving price to offset it from a dollar amount, but that raises the denominator in the margin calc without raising the numerator from the profit because it offsets it. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Julian Mitchell : You have Matthew Shaffer on from Julian Mitchell's team. So, you guys mentioned that pricing is expected to beat inflation in 2022. Can you maybe talk to the cadence of the price cost differential through the remaining quarters? Mike Wagnes : As you think of the first quarter, we were slightly negative. We provide that information in our 10-Q. So, you'll see it in our 10-Q by region and in total. But, say, $7 million underwater in the first quarter. As you progress throughout the year, think of Q2 being closer to breakeven-ish and then Q3 and Q4 substantial price in excess of that inflation or price and productivity in excess of the inflation. So, gets better as the year progresses and then significantly positive in the back half. Julian Mitchell : Just a follow-up for me. Electronics was up low-single digits in Americas Q1 after being pretty weak in 2021. Just curious the expectation is for 2022 growth for electronics. Mike Wagnes : We don't provide individual growth rates, electronics versus mechanical. But if you think about our performance in the first quarter, substantial improvement from what you saw Q4, as you mentioned. The demand is there. The demand will be limited by the ability to get the supply. So, I would just say, take it into account when you consider our total guide for revenue, understanding that it's better than what you saw in the fourth quarter. And in the back half, we do comp against those easier comparables that we had in the back half of last year. Operator : Our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Joseph Nolan : This is Joe Nolan on for David MacGregor. On the residential business, you mentioned revenues were down mid-single digits. Are you able to talk about what units did in that business? And then I'm aware it's always been a difficult channel to get pricing in. So, if you could just talk about how the recent price increase is trending in terms of how that's gone into the channel. Mike Wagnes : If you look at our resi business, we mentioned earlier that it had positive price realization for the quarter, not as strong as non-res. From a unit perspective then, you can see that units would be a little less than the total growth because we did have the positive price realization.  More importantly, moving forward, we've taken actions in residential to drive price that has been announced to the marketplace and goes into effect in the second quarter. So, we expect to see better price realization in the second quarter and onward through 2022. Joseph Nolan : Can you just give an update on trends in spec writing activity, just the size of projects, your content, order size, timing, that sort of stuff? Dave Petratis : I would say spec writing activity continues to be robust. You can look at the ABI. I think the march ABI was at like a 58. I'd say a good range of projects with strength in the medical and hospital areas, which is good for Allegion. Can't really get into the size of these, but the order activity is good, and I think reflects the strength we're seeing in our incoming bookings. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Rutenberg from Imperial Capital. Brian Rutenberg : Great quarter. So I'd like to break things down a little bit on gross versus operating margins. So, gross margins were down from fourth quarter and obviously down year-over-year. Do you expect gross margins to increase from first quarter to second quarter and then progress couple hundred basis points per quarter? Is that what you're saying? Mike Wagnes : Yeah, I would say, if you think about the gross margin, that's inflation in excess of pricing that we talked about in the 10-Q. As you think about margins, in general, they'll improve as we get throughout the year. So, we should see both the gross and the operating improve as we move throughout 2022. Brian Rutenberg : So, on the operating basis, we'll also see improvement sequentially with that because there's going to be lower SG&A or just increased leverage from the top line and more gross profit. Mike Wagnes : As you get significant growth in the back half of the year, Q2, Q3, Q4, you leverage that SG&A base. So, that does help also the operating margins. Dave Petratis : Volume is a very beautiful thing in this business. And as we go through the second half, the business leverage quite nicely. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Unidentified Participant : You have Sabrina Abrams [ph] on from Andrew Obin's team. I understand that you mentioned you're sort of expecting them, but in the past month, have you been seeing worsening supply chain impacts from the COVID-related China shutdowns and from the Russia-Ukraine conflict? Dave Petratis : I'd say we have very little exposure to Russia. I'd say the bigger effect there has been pricing of raw materials. And we'll adapt to that with price. As we think about China, it's certainly serious. We have exposure there, but it has not affected us in April. And I think we've got the adaptability to be able to work through that. We're not totally immune, but are in geographic production capabilities position us well. Unidentified Participant : I understand that you're raising the revenue guide and maintaining the EPS range on inflation. But I guess I'm curious, you guys had a strong EPS beat in 1Q and are maintaining that guide. Are there any other headwinds we should be thinking about besides inflation in the remainder of the year? Mike Wagnes : As we think about where we are today, we just completed the first quarter. We've got three quarters to go. Feel good that we got out to a nice start to the year. As we started the year, we had a very back half loaded plan. Getting off to a good start makes us feel even better about us hitting our EPS range. Operator : There are no more questions in the queue. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Petratis for any closing remarks. Dave Petratis : To wrap up our main themes you heard today, Allegion got off to a solid start in 2022. Demand remains robust and leading indicators are positive. We continue to work through supply chain challenges that macroeconomic events in China could delay in the improvement of some of the global supply chains. It's not unique to Allegion, but it does affect us. Pressure in electronic components is expected to persist. Inflation continues. We are aggressively producing price in all channels and products and we'll get the price cost equation back to positive this year.  And last, we're excited to welcome Stanley's Access Technology business to the Allegion family and portfolio of products.  Thank you and have a safe day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Dave Petratis : Thanks, Tom. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Please go to Slide number 4. Before we provide our business and financial overview for you for the quarter, I want to start by acknowledging two significant announcements from the last few months. In May, I shared my plans to retire from Allegion announcing John Stone as the incoming President and CEO of Allegion. John is the right leader to take Allegion into its next chapter. And I'm happy to say, Allegion has the right talent, right strategy, and right foundation to successfully execute its vision of seamless access and a safer world under John's leadership. It's been a privilege for you to know John and learn about his service to our country as a West Point graduate, Army Officer and Veteran. He also has a background in engineering and manufacturing with a track record of leading sustainable profitable growth, building from the core business by layering on new innovation and technology. We are particularly impressed by John's experience, leading Deere & Company\u2019s Intelligence Solutions Group. John is well versed in connectivity, having guiding the company through the digital transformation for agriculture. He drove value through digital tools, helping the industry become more productive through innovative technologies like automation, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. He leverages the IoT to deliver wireless data, sensing technologies, as well as innovative remote service capabilities. All of this enhanced the performance and value of traditional mechanical equipment and allowed customers to drive their own operational efficiencies. Most of all, John has experience at managing complexity. Deere & Company is a complex global business and his leadership opened an important route to precision agriculture during his time there. In many ways, John has already driven growth and success utilizing seamless access strategies. John, would you like to say a few words? John Stone : Yes. Thank you, Dave and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call. I'm looking forward to getting to know each of you a lot better over the coming quarters. Dave, I am super energized to be here, highly motivated by our higher purpose of pioneering safety and motivated by our vision of seamless access for a safer world. I agree with you that Allegion has a very sound foundation. We've got great brands, great products, a strong team strong culture, and customer relationships that have stood the test of time. I'm looking forward to visiting more of our sites in the coming weeks, getting to know our employees, our investors, and our customers and learning the business at a deeper level right alongside our experts. I feel it's a really exciting time to be part of Allegion. Back to you, Dave. Dave Petratis : Thank you, John. Leading Allegion has been an honor and one of the most rewarding experiences of my professional career. And I'm proud to turn over the reins of this incredible organization to you, John Stone. Please go to Slide number 5. In the second quarter, we shared Allegion's intent to acquire the Access Technologies business from Stanley. I'm happy to announce that of July 5, Access Technology is now a part of the Allegion family. The Access Technology business bolsters Allegion's seamless access strategy with a category market leader that has more than 90 years of history and innovation. Automatic entrance solutions is a strategic investment that addresses a gap in our portfolio. We're adding a high growth service and support network to our North American portfolio, which will position us better as devices become more connected. Importantly, bringing the Access Technologies business to Allegion also provides clear synergy and incremental revenue opportunities. And we believe we're creating a stronger long-term financial profile for our company that will deliver long-term value creation for Allegion\u2019s shareholders. Simply put, with Access Technology as a part of Allegion, we are now able to offer our customers broader solutions and services and continuing to grow profitably. At this time, I want to go over Access Technology's expected financial impacts for the second half of 2022. We expect the business to deliver approximately 9% growth in the full-year top line number for the Americas segment. We are also projecting the business will be diluted by \u2013 to adjusted EPS by approximately $0.10 per share in 2022. Breaking down that impact further, the Access Technology\u2019s business is expected to deliver $0.20 per share of operational earnings offset by non-cash intangible asset amortization of negative $0.13 per share and increased interest expense related to financing the deal is expected to drive a negative $0.17 per share impact. I want to reiterate that the Allegion team is proud to welcome the Access Technology's dedicated employees who bring immense talent and expertise in safety, security, and service to our Americas segment, as well as our global organization. We're excited to have you here. Please go to Slide number 6. As we look at business conditions, American non-residential market demand remains very strong and we expect that to continue. Leading indicators are showing expansionary readings. On the flip side, we are beginning to see some softening in the Allegion International segment and Americas residential markets from previous robust levels. In international, we are seeing the impacts of geopolitical instability and zero tolerance COVID policies in China that have negatively impacted volume. We continue to make progress on our supply chain actions, which have resulted in improving component availability for mechanical products. Electronic component challenges continue, however the product redesigns and alternative sourcing actions we have taken set us up better for the remainder of the year and 2023. Looking at price versus cost, we delivered strong price in the quarter across the entire portfolio. Price realization accelerated again in Q2 and was the driver of organic growth in the quarter. Price exceeded inflation in the quarter and we expect that to continue for the remainder of the year. Allegion will assess the need for future price increases. We remain vigilant to increase \u2013 to ensure that price and productivity exceeds inflation. Lastly, our Allegion International business is experiencing significant currency pressure as the dollar strengthens. In the second quarter, reported revenues reflect 22 million of currency pressure related to foreign exchange rates. And as noted in our press release, currency headwinds are driving a reduction in our full-year EPS outlook to the effect of $0.09 per share. Now, let's turn to the quarterly performance for more details. Please go to Slide 7. Revenue for the second quarter was 773 million, an increase of 3.5%, compared to last year. Organic revenue growth was 6.4%. The organic revenue increase in the quarter was driven by significant price realization of 8.4%. The negative volume was driven by the Allegion America's residential business, which was comparing against a robust to Q2 2021 growth rate associated with prior year catch up on COVID related backlog. It was also impacted by the current year electronic parts shortages. Allegion International delivered organic growth driven by price, but faced volume declines that were driven by COVID-19 lockdowns in China and softening European markets. Mike will share more detail on the business segments in a moment. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margins increased by 40 basis points and 30 basis points respectively in the second quarter. The increase was driven by price productivity, exceeding inflation, which include favorable corporate cost, and favorable business mix, which more than offset the negative impacts of volume deleverage and incremental investments. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.37 increased $0.05 or approximately 4% versus the prior year. Strong operational performance and favorable share count more than offset a favorable impact from FX, investments, other income, and tax rate. Mike will now walk you through the financials and our updated 2022 outlook. Mike Wagnes : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I want to echo Dave's comments in welcoming John as our new President and CEO and in welcoming Access Technology employees to Allegion. Please go to Slide number 8. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter of 2021, reported earnings per share was $1.31. Adjusting $0.01 per charges related to restructuring and acquisition expenses, the 2021 adjusted earnings per share was $1.32. Strong operational results increased earnings per share by $0.13, net of $0.05 per share pressure related to FX. The performance was driven by significant price, which exceeded inflation and business mix driven by the strength of the Americas non-residential business. Favorable share count increased earnings per share by $0.03 and the impact of acquisition and divestitures drove another $0.01 per share. A higher year-over-year tax rate reduced earnings by $0.02 per share and the combination of interest and other income drove another $0.05 reduction. Investment spending had a $0.05 per share drag on earnings as we continue to invest in the business to fuel long-term growth, expand our electronic capabilities, and drive our seamless access strategy. This results in an adjusted second quarter 2022 earnings per share of $1.37, an increase of $0.05 or 3.8% compared to the prior year. Lastly, we had a $0.07 per share reduction from the net of non-operating gains and charges related to restructuring, acquisitions, and debt financing costs. After giving effect to these items, you arrive at the second quarter 2022 reported earnings per share of $1.30. Please go to Slide number 9. This slide depicts the components of our revenue performance for the quarter. I\u2019ll focus on total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we experienced 6.4% organic revenue growth in the second quarter, driven by strong price realization. Although the total company volume was down, we did see significant strength in our Americas non-residential business, which is starting to benefit from our supply chain actions over the last year. As mentioned previously, currency headwinds were significant in the quarter and reduced reported revenue by 3%. There was a small impact from acquisitions bringing the total reported growth to 3.5% for Q2. Please go to Slide number 10. Second quarter revenue for the Americas segment was 592.3 million, up 7.8% on a reported basis and up 8% organically. The segment delivered significant price realization coming in at 9.4% in the quarter. Both the non-residential and residential businesses delivered strong pricing. Pricing helped the non-residential business grow high teens when combined with volume growth. Residential was down mid-teens driven by a prior year catch-up on COVID related backlogs and continued pressure in electronic components availability. Electronics revenue was down low single digits, driven primarily by electronic component shortages that limit our ability to fully meet demand. Americas adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter were down 150 basis points and 160 basis points, respectively. The Q2 margin performance was a sequential improvement from Q1. For the quarter, price exceeded inflation and productivity headwinds on a dollar basis, but were dilutive to operating margins. Please go to Slide number 11. Second quarter revenue for our Allegion International segment was 180.8 million, down 8.5% on a reported basis and up 1.9% organically. The organic growth was driven by solid price realization, which more than offset the volume declines experienced as a result of COVID shutdowns in China and geopolitical pressures in Europe. The negative impact related to currency headwinds reduced reported revenues by 10.9% as the U.S. dollar has strengthened substantially against other foreign currencies. Second quarter international adjusted operating margins decreased 100 basis points, compared to last year and adjusted EBITDA margins were down 60 basis points. The margin decline was driven by unfavorable impacts from volume and mix, FX, and incremental investments that more than offset the favorable impact of price and productivity exceeding inflation. Please go to Slide number 12. Year to date available cash flow for the first half of 2022 came in at 84.5 million, which is a decrease of more than 165 million, compared to the prior year. The 84.5 million is more in-line with historical levels. Last year's cash flow was driven primarily by lower working capital, due to the pandemic. We are now projecting that 2022 full-year available cash flow to be between 420 million and 440 million. The reduction in ACF from the prior outlook is primarily related to investing in inventory to create supply chain resiliency and to better serve our customers. This will position us to manage backlogs, which are expected to be elevated entering 2023 due to strong non-residential demand. The revised cash flow outlook includes the impact of the Access Technologies business, inclusive of operational cash flows offset by acquisition and integration costs related to the transaction. As discussed earlier, we closed on the acquisition of Access Technologies business on July 5. The transaction was funded by issuing senior notes and utilization of our revolver. As mentioned when we announced the acquisition, we expect to use excess cash generated during the remainder of the year to pay down short-term debt to taken on to complete the transaction. This would be after paying expected dividends, which are subject to Board approval. Please go to Slide number 13. We now turn our attention to the revised revenue outlook. Non-residential markets in the Americas continues to be robust, leading indicators remain positive, and the level of specifications continues to be strong. Consistent with the broader macro industry, we are beginning to see signs of residential softening from robust COVID level peaks. However, we remain positive on the long-term growth opportunity in residential due to the undersupply of homes to meet demand and the long-term trend of electronic adoption. We've been aggressive in pursuing price in all channels and products and as a result, expect to deliver solid price realization for the remainder of the year that will more than offset substantial inflationary headwinds. As noted previously, we expect the newly acquired Access Technologies business to deliver approximately 9% growth for the full-year reported Americas revenue. With these parameters in place, we are now projecting total growth for the Americas to be up 21% to 22% and organic revenue to be up 12% to 13%. The increase in the Americas organic revenue outlook is primarily driven by price to offset the ongoing inflationary pressures. Allegion International experienced sequential improvement in price realization. However, we are beginning to see markets soften and currency pressures are anticipated to continue. For Allegion International, we are revising our outlook for total revenue to be down 7% to 8% with organic growth coming in at 2% to 3%. All in for a total Allegion, we expect revenue growth to be in the 13% to 14% range with organic revenue increasing 9% to 10%. Please go to Slide 14. For our EPS outlook, we are expecting reported EPS to come into a range of $5.05 to $5.15 per share, and adjusted EPS to be between $5.35 to $5.45. These ranges include the approximately negative 10% impact related to Access Technologies acquisition as the discussed earlier. The updated outlook also includes a $0.09 per share reduction from the prior outlook related to currency pressure. This outlook assumes incremental investments of approximately $0.20 per share. As a reminder, the incremental investment spend is predominantly related to R&D and technology investments to accelerate future growth and support our seamless access strategy. Also included in the revised outlook is a slight increase in interest expense driven by an increase in variable interest rates on the base business. This does not include the Access Technologies acquisition, which will have a $0.17 per share negative impact related to financing we secured to close the transaction. That impact is included in the overall $0.10 per share dilution from the acquisition. I will now hand it back to Dave for some closing remarks. Dave Petratis : Thank you, Mike. Please go to Slide number 15. To wrap up the main things you heard today, Allegion is excited to welcome John Stone as President and CEO. He brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise that will help Allegion on its seamless access journey. We are also excited to welcome Access Technologies to Allegion. This is a category market leader with a strategic investment that expands our core business. Globally, Allegion is driving significant price realization and has turned the price productivity inflation dynamic positive. The supply chain actions we have taken will help efficiency and productivity in our manufacturing locations and along with ongoing price realization will continue to drive pricing and productivity to exceed inflation. Non-residential markets in the Americas continue to be robust. Leading indicators have been positive for over a year and given the late cycle nature of that business, this bodes well for the near term future, plus we are still sitting on healthy backlog levels that should fuel future growth as supply chains normalize. With that, Mike and I would now be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Thanks very much and wish Dave all the best and thanks for your help and look forward to working with you John. In terms of \u2013 I guess the first question would probably be around \u2013 on the residential business, understand you've had, sort of several quarters of very tough comps and sort of a destock that had to happen, maybe help us understand on residential today, where are you on the inventories, kind of in the channel? The comp should get easier in the second half year-on-year, but the broader U.S. resi demand backdrop is probably worse than you had thought a few months ago. So, maybe help us understand, kind of what slope of residential revenue growth we should get in the second half of the year and the assumptions behind it? Dave Petratis : So, thank you for your comments, Julian, and for your questions, and support over the years. When I think about the residential market. We moved through this \u2013 went through this supply chain, which has been pretty dramatic over the last 24, 36 months. I continue to be positive on residential. We still have some noise, but there's an undersupply of housing. We'll see some softening in the R&R, but we have maybe been hit harder in res because of the lack of electronic chips. We'll build momentum back over the second half and into 2023. I think the nation's got to build between 800,000 and a million single family homes. So, I think that's net opportunity as we look at the change. Mike Wagnes : And Julian, if you think about guides, we don't guide the residential business. We do give outlooks for Americas in total, but just \u2013 I'll just agree with you. We had that prior year comp in the second quarter that went up against last year. The second half for this year is much easier comps versus last year. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. Thank you. And then just my second question would be around the, sort of the price cost dynamics. Any updated thoughts around how that plays out in terms of margin impact in the back half? And I suppose based on the recent declines in spot commodity prices, when do you see those perhaps rolling into your gross margins in terms of the timing of those lower costs starting to help the gross margin? And do you think you can retain those savings when they come through or they might have to be passed back to the customer? Dave Petratis : Yes. So, Julian, as you think about price cost, we struggled at the end of last year. We got slightly behind and we put efforts to raise prices to get that price productivity inflation positive. We had improvement in Q1. In Q2, we are now positive. Like we said, we would be as we look to the back half that continues to be positive for both quarters in the back half, we'll be positive for the full-year and price productivity inflation. We do have substantial inflationary pressures in the back half and we've taken additional pricing actions to mitigate that. As a result, you'll see that price productivity inflation positive, as well as margin expansion in the back half. If you think about commodity prices, those spot prices are coming down. As you see from the public markets, they're still elevated versus, say historic norms. Any decrease in commodity prices is not something 2022 we feel because we've been putting in those purchase orders to ensure that we had adequate parts and inventory to meet that demand that we have. So, as you think about price productivity inflation, think of it as a net plus in the back half full-year and we're back to expanding margins. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead, sir. Joe Nolan : Hi. This is Joe Nolan on for David. Congrats on a nice quarter, guys. Dave Petratis : Thanks. Hi, Joe. Joe Nolan : So, I was just wondering within the Americas non-residential business, can you just talk about how distributor inventories look? And also just wondering, are you seeing any increase in order cancellations or signs that distributors maybe getting more cautious about holding inventory in a slowing macro environment? Dave Petratis : I would say, as we think about distributor inventory and wholesale pull through, I would say it's normalized. Remember there was a big to pull back 15 months ago as we entered COVID. I would say it's normalized. Wholesalers typically play the price increase gain intelligently. They'll bring in those orders earlier ahead of a price increase to create a margin opportunity for themselves, but I would say they are solid. There are some deficiencies within our portfolio, which would be electronics, which will improve over the second half of the year. I would say, second half of the question. Mike Wagnes : Yes, I would say that the \u2013 if you think of our business, we've had such supply chain challenges last year. So, as we move forward to this year, our distribution base is looking for product. So, we have very healthy backlogs. Demand is very strong, elevated backlog. So, as we move forward, we feel very confident about the non-residential business. Dave Petratis : I would also say, touch base with our teams on cancellations, not seeing it. There's a demand for product flow. There's a very strong construction backlog right at nine months and the indicators would suggest work in for a good 12 months to 18 months of non-residential activity. Joe Nolan : Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then just as a quick follow-up on the Access Technologies business, can you just talk about what this acquisition adds revenue wise to your aftermarket business and whether it would be accretive or dilutive to margins on the existing business? Thanks. Mike Wagnes : Yes. If you think about Access Technologies, when we announced it in April, we talked about that 38% of the business was service revenue. Our business today, we don't have service revenue to a substantial level, especially in the Americas. We have some out in the international, but in the Americas, we don't have that service capability. So, this is a great asset to add to our existing portfolio as we leverage their strengths with our Allegion Americas strengths. Dave Petratis : I would add that in our vision of seamless access and smart connected edge devices on the doors, the service component becomes required by our customers and the ability to grow recurring revenues through services, we like the opportunity. Mike Wagnes : And I think you also asked about margins. When you think about Access Technologies, we gave some guidance in the April call, how that business is, think of it as a mid-teen EBITDA margin. Joe Nolan : Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. I'll pass it along. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from the line of Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please go ahead, sir. Brett Linzey : Hi, good morning and congrats today, best of luck, and welcome to John. John Stone : Thank you. Dave Petratis : Thank you. Brett Linzey : Just wanted to come back to the electronics activity still continues to show just kind of uneven performance here with the chip constraints. I guess as you've gotten closer to the redesigns and some of these new suppliers coming ramping up here, I mean should we see the electronic growth snap back here in the second half or do you expect this to be still uneven for the next few quarters as you kind of work through some of those new product designs? Mike Wagnes : Brett, as you think about revenue growth, so much of it has to do with the prior year comparable. Electronics growth should be better in the back half from a growth percentage as you think about prior year. In addition, we are seeing signs of improvement related to the activity we've been driving on the product redesign. So, both those areas should lead to better second half growth than what we experienced in the first half. Brett Linzey : Okay, got it. And just coming back to the reporting convention and thinking about the guidance framework and now rolling in Access Technologies, have you considered ever moving to ex-amortization? I mean, it is a big number, so that's question one. And just the follow-up would be, within this new framework, are there any one time items related to integration or anything that we should be thinking about maybe don't repeat, sort of the second half of the year ownership? Mike Wagnes : Yes. So, if you think about the one-timers we backed that out of reported EPS to get to our adjusted EPS, right? So, if you look at our guide, we have that at the bottom of the schedule. With respect to amortization expense, we started the year obviously with our guide. We're using the same presentation that we have when we started the year, but clearly identifying that amortization drag because it is significant for Access Technologies. We're going to get through 2022 using this presentation. With respect to the future, we can tackle that in the future, but when you think about 2022, we're going to have that amortization in the adjusted EPS, but we're going to clearly show it to you and provide it to you so you can have all those details. Brett Linzey : Okay, great. I will pass it along. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from the line of Brian Rutenberg with Imperial Capital. Please go ahead, sir. Brian Rutenberg : Yes, thank you very much. A couple of quick questions. In your guidance for 2022, what do you assume the supply chain will do? Will it get better, worse, the same? Just want to know what are your assumptions are around the supply chain? Mike Wagnes : Yes. As you look at our guide for the back half of 2022, we are seeing improvement, especially in the mechanical space in the non-residential business. This is attributable to all the sourcing actions we've taken over the last year. So, as we think about that non-res growth, right, that high teens that we had, part of that is attributable to a better supply chain due to our activity. Our back half is taking into account what we've known we've done and chips that our partners have committed to get to us or provided us. Chips are always fragile, as you know, that can move, but this is not seeing a [sea change] [ph] of improvement that we don't have line of sight to. So, if you think about back half, think of it as the activity we've driven is helping provide better confidence in our ability to meet our customers' needs. Dave Petratis : I would add two. If you look at some of the macro numbers, [Institutional Supply Management] [ph], deliveries across the board to all industrial players have improved. I'd say number two, the system of all manufacturers remain fragile, a port strike, COVID surge, puts a level of uncertainty that we've grown to navigate, but it remains fragile. And I'd say, the extensive work Allegion has done on the mechanical and electronics positions us nicely for the second half. We\u2019d factor that in. I think we're not alone. The electronic flows for chips and other components is improving and that will benefit Allegion in 2022 and nicely steps up in 2023. Brian Rutenberg : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back to our Executive Chairman, Dave Petratis, for any closing remarks. Dave Petratis : Thank you. This concludes my 56th earning call as a CEO. The balance here at Allegion. This will likely be my last call. I want to thank our shareholders and the financial community for their support over the years. I also want to thank Nelson Peltz and Mike Lamach for the opportunity to create and lead Allegion. I want to thank Kirk Hachigian and the Allegion Board. Kirk has been with me since the day one. Kirk and the Allegion Board has helped create this company and guide us to where we are today. Last, a heartfelt thank you to the people of Allegion worldwide. You have a great new leader in John Stone. We have done some great work together. Allegion, your best days are ahead of you. Be safe, be healthy, and thanks for all your contributions. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

We would like to give everyone an opportunity given the time allotted. Please go to Slide 4 and I\u2019ll turn the call over to John. John Stone : Thanks, Tom. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. Allegion delivered a very strong third quarter and as we look at the market dynamics, we continue to see strength in the Americas non-residential sector. Leading indicators for that business like the ABI and AIA consensus are positive and continue to be in expansionary territory, particularly for institutional verticals. On the Americas residential side, our business grew nicely in the quarter, but we are seeing signs of a slowing market. Certainly new construction is impacted by rising mortgage rates and retail point of sale for our industry is returning to more normal levels. Although Allegion International is experiencing broader weakness in many of its markets, we continue to see strength and demand for our electronics and software solutions. Allegion delivered record revenue during the third quarter. This is due to the hard work and dedication of our team as we've made significant progress on product redesign and other supply chain improvements that are driving strong operational performance across the company. Top line revenue was also aided by robust price realization in the quarter across the world. I do want to highlight that while we've made some progress, there's still choppiness in the electronic supply chain, backlogs, and electronics are still elevated as demand for those products has remained strong. At the beginning of the year, we underscore our commitment to aggressively pursue price across all products and in all channels. The result of this effort is evident in the quarterly results. While we continue to experience inflationary headwinds, our price productivity inflation dynamic was positive this quarter, both on a dollar and margin basis. Allegion will continue to assess the need for future price increases. Lastly, the currency pressures impacting our international businesses persist, the reported revenues in the third quarter reflect $26 million of pressure related to foreign exchange rates. Please go to Slide 5. At the beginning of the quarter, on July 5, in fact, we officially welcome The Access Technologies business into the Allegion family. Together, we will deliver long-term value for customers, shareholders, and employees alike and we're already moving in that direction. The operational performance of the business was in-line with the expectations shared with you in last quarter's earnings call and our teams are getting well aligned on culture, vision, and strategy. Just as important, our early work together affirms that Access Technologies and Allegion are a great combination. We have unique opportunities to accelerate our seamless access strategy with innovation that will create new value around doors and entrances. This is where I get to say a picture says a thousand words, and we now have a well-established recurring service business that positions us to meet new customer needs as devices become more connected and technology advances. And we have expanded portfolio of products that fills gaps, complements our business, and takes full advantage of our demand generation specification engine in the Americas. Bottom line, Access Technologies is a strong business. It's another category market leader for Allegion. We're off to a great start and excited about the opportunities ahead. Now, let's turn to Slide 6 and take a look at the quarter performance for more details. Revenue for the third quarter was 914 million, an increase of 27.4% compared to last year. Organic revenue growth was 18.6% attributed to both significant price realization worldwide and strong volume growth in the Americas. The Access Technologies acquisition contributed approximately 12% to the total growth number and currency impacts remain a significant headwind. Mike will share more details on the segment reporting in a moment. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margins increased by 100 basis points each in the third quarter. The increase was driven by volume leverage in the Americas, as well as price and productivity exceeding inflation. These more than offset the margin dilution related to Access Technologies. Excluding the Access Technologies business adjusted operating income margins were up 240 basis points. Adjusted EPS of $1.64 increased $0.08 or approximately 5% versus the prior year. Robust operational performance more than offset the unfavorable tax rate impact, which is compared against the prior year that had substantial non-recurring benefits. Mike will now walk you through the financials and I'll be back later to discuss our 2022 outlook. Mike Wagnes : Thanks, John, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to Slide number 7. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2021, reported earnings per share was $1.59 and adjusted earnings per share was $1.56. Operational results were very strong in the quarter, adding $0.49 per share, reflecting 31.4% growth. This was driven by strong pricing, volume, and operational execution, which more than offset inflationary and currency pressures. Access Technologies delivered $0.06 to earnings per share as operational results of $0.10 per share offset $0.04 of intangible amortization. The operational results were as expected and amortization was favorable. A year-over-year tax rate reduced earnings by $0.28 per share. This decline was driven by tax benefits in 2021 that were non-recurring. As anticipated, interest expense was a $0.12 per share drag on earnings, primarily driven by increased debt-to-finance the acquisition of Access Technologies. Other income was a $0.08 per share reduction as the prior year had some favorable items that did not repeat in 2022. Favorable share count offset the impact of investment spending in the quarter. This results in adjusted third quarter 2022 earnings per share of $1.64, an increase of $0.08 or 5.1%, compared to the prior year. Lastly, we have a $0.34 per share reduction from adjusted EPS to arrive at reported EPS. This reduction is attributable to M&A and additional non-purchase accounting items related to Access Technologies, along with the loss on the divestiture of our Milre business in South Korea. After giving effect to these items, you arrive at third quarter 2022 reported earnings per share of $1.30. Please go to Slide number 8. This slide depicts the components of our revenue performance for the quarter. I'll focus on total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we experienced a robust 18.6% organic revenue growth in the third quarter, driven by both price and volume. Strength in Allegion Americas, both non-residential and residential led to volume growth. Net acquisition and divestitures delivered 12.4% growth driven by Access Technologies. Currency pressures continue to be a significant headwind, primarily impacting our international segment, bringing the total reported growth to 27.4% in the quarter. Please go to Slide number 9. Third quarter revenues for the Americas segment was 747.2 million, up 42.5% on a reported basis and up 25.8% organically. This segment delivered significant price realization in both our non-residential and residential businesses as we remain committed to addressing inflation. Aided by substantial price and strong volume, non-residential grew approximately 30% in the quarter. Residential was up mid-teens, also driven by both price and volume. A portion of our growth was fueled by backlog reductions as the actions our team undertook helped us improve component availability and shipments in the quarter. Electronics revenue was up approximately 30% and was a significant improvement from the growth rates experienced the past few quarters. This was supported by continued strength in demand and the timing of component availability. While it is important to note that electronic component supply chains remain choppy, our reengineering and alternate supply efforts are providing improved flexibility to our supply capabilities. Access Technologies contributed mid-teens percent to the Americas reported growth numbers. Americas adjusted operating margins and adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter were up 50 basis points and 80 basis points respectively. This includes Access Technologies, which we previously stated, would be dilutive to margins. Excluding Access Technologies, the business drove a 300 basis point improvement in operating margins versus the prior year. Volume leverage contributed to the margin increase and for the quarter. Price productivity inflation dynamic was positive both on dollars and margins. Please go to Slide number 10. Third quarter revenue for our Allegion International segment was 166.5 million, down 13.6% on a reported basis and down [0.8%] [ph] organically. In the quarter, strong price realization mostly offset lower volumes. Lower volumes are attributable to end market softening. However, demand for our electronics and software solution remained stable. Currency headwinds persisted this quarter and reduced reported revenue by 12.8%. Third quarter international adjusted operating margins decreased 180 basis points compared to last year, and adjusted EBITDA margins were down 160 basis points. The margin decline was driven by reduced volume and FX pressures, which more than offset favorable impacts of the combination of price productivity and inflation. Please go to Slide number 11. Year to date available cash flow is 225.6 million, which is a decrease of more than 102 million, compared to the prior year period. This year's available cash flow continues to be in-line with three pandemic levels. We continue to operate with a strong debt structure with 80% of our debt having fixed interest rates. We currently have 199 million outstanding on our revolving borrowings. During the third quarter, we repaid approximately 140 million from the initial draw used to help fund the acquisition of Access Technologies. We have a strong leverage profile with our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 2.9x at the end of the quarter. We still plan to use the excess cash generated during the remainder of the year to pay down the revolver. This would be after paying expected dividends, which are subject to Board approval and other debt payments. The 2022 full-year available cash flow outlook is unchanged from our prior outlook remaining at a range of 420 million to 440 million. I will now hand it back to John for an update on our full-year 2022 outlook. John Stone : Thanks Mike. So, please go to Slide 12 and looking at our full-year 2022 outlook, and to reiterate a few things said earlier in the call, we see non-residential market demand in the Americas as remaining strong. Leading indicators remain favorable. Further, while demand for electronics products remain strong, residential markets in the Americas are indeed softening. As you've heard, the Allegion team has made significant progress on supply chain challenges, our electronics growth was strong this quarter, and we continue to navigate the choppiness of component supply. Long-term, we expect electronics adoption to remain a growth driver for Allegion. Given this backdrop, we're raising the outlook for Americas and are now projecting total growth to be between 22.5% and 23.5% with organic revenue to be up 13.5% to 14.5% for the year. Allegion International experienced another quarter of solid price realization and stable demand for our electronics and software solutions. However, we see the broader markets continue to soften, driven by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors and currency pressures are anticipated to remain. For the Allegion International segment, we're revising our outlook for total revenue to be down 10.5% to 11.5% with approximately flat organic growth. All-in for total Allegion, we expect revenue growth to be in the 13% to 14% range with organic revenues increasing 9.5% to 10.5%. Please go to Slide 13. We are expecting reported EPS to come in at a range of %4.90 to $5 per share and adjusted EPS to be between $5.40 to $5.50. The adjusted EPS increase from the prior outlook is driven by lower Access Technologies and tangible amortization. The revised amortization takes the outlook for the acquisition impact to negative $0.05 per share versus negative $0.10 per share we communicated last quarter. Our updated outlook assumes incremental investments of approximately $0.17 per share. And as a reminder, the incremental investment spend is predominantly related to R&D and technology investments to further accelerate our growth and support our seamless access strategy. The $0.20 per share increase in reported to non-GAAP adjustments from the previous outlook is driven by the loss on the mill rate divestiture and non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, which were primarily recorded in this quarter. Please go to Slide 14 and let's wrap this up. Here's the main themes I hope you heard today. Allegion had a very strong third quarter. Our operational performance was exceptional. The entire Allegion team deserves a lot of credit for this. The Access Technologies acquisition is off to a great start and performing as expected. We're excited to have this business and the people as a part of the Allegion family and to have automated entrance solutions in our portfolio. We've made significant progress on supply chain challenges, although choppiness in electronics components persist. America's non-residential demand is still strong, leading indicators are still positive, and we continue to see strength and demand for our global electronics products. To reiterate, we see electronics adoption as a long-term growth driver for Allegion. I'm very proud of the dedication and resiliency of our entire team and the results we've delivered this quarter. With that, Mike and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi good morning guys. John Stone : Good morning. Josh, good to hear you on the call. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just wanted to begin a little bit on this, kind of non-resi backlog phenomenon, it's not really a metric you guys talked about as much, but with the growth in the quarter clearly supply chain improvement, but get some product out the door. Can you maybe contextualize how much of the excess backlog you worked off? And how should we think about, maybe kind of a normalized margin? Because I would imagine the mix on that influences things a lot once we get past that backlog period? Mike Wagnes : Yes, Josh, as you know, we had built backlog starting the end of last year. And most of that driven by some supply chain, as well as really strong demand. As you look at the third quarter, we have better component availability as we talked about on the call. That helped drive more revenue in the Americas non-res at 30%, and not all of that obviously is demand. So, we did reduce backlog levels. We don't disclose the exact amounts, but we did have a very strong volume growth, which we provided and that's driven by both demand being strong, as well as backlog reductions. With respect to margins, the key thing about margins for us is, we're driving that price realization to offset the inflationary pressures that we've been seeing. This quarter, we finally turned the corner on the margin percent. Last quarter, it was offsetting on dollars. So, we've made significant progress here as we progressed over the last few quarters on that element. So, it's those key items, I think that have led to the margin expansion you saw. John Stone : Josh, this is John. I would just add one thing that probably every manufacturer has dealt with. When we talk about choppiness in the supply chain, without a doubt that injects this or the other inefficiency into the factories. So, that's \u2013 there's been some cost inefficiencies over time that we've been working through and certainly that's on the way towards improvement as well, but just one other nuance there to your questions. That's a good one. Thank you. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up on the pricing dynamic. I know you guys and the industry in general honors exist and quotes out there. So, price kind of layers in over time. What inning are we in, in terms of being caught up on price versus having these outstanding older price quotes? Mike Wagnes : Yes. We've been raising price pretty consistently over the last year as we've had such challenges in the inflationary environment. I would say, the dynamic of price productivity and inflation will be positive moving forward. So, I wouldn't expect a situation where we turn the other way. We\u2019ve had the dynamic positive and expected to be positive moving forward. Josh Pokrzywinski : Perfect. Appreciate the color. Thanks guys. Best of luck. Operator : The next question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Kiran Patel-O'Connor: Hi. This is Kiran Patel-O'Connor on for Julian Mitchell. So, I just wanted to ask on residential. So, it looks like residential growth in the Americas are inflected positively, and I just wanted to get a sense of, is this more of a function of supply chains easing versus underlying demand and to what extent do you see this growth as sustainable going forward given what we're seeing in housing market? John Stone : Thanks for the question. This is John. I would say, you know, going back to our comments, certainly the Americas residential market is softening. We're reading the same headlines that you are. Higher mortgage rates is certainly going to have an impact there. I would say our performance in the quarter is without a doubt due to strong demand for our products. We have good products, people like them, we get good reviews. Our electronics growth, you saw, was very strong, which is quite prevalent in the residential sector, but the broader market is softening without a doubt. I think electronics remains a tailwind for us. And yes, so what more to say there. I think that's it, broader market softening a little bit, electronics is favorable, that's a tailwind, and yes, so we're still chugging along. Kiran Patel-O'Connor : That's helpful. Thanks. And then my follow-up is, just kind of what you're seeing in the channel? Based on your results today, it doesn't seem as if you're seeing any signs of destocking, which we're seeing in some other industrial markets. So, can you give us a color of what you're seeing in channel from an inventories perspective? And what underlying demand is looking like relative to that? John Stone : Thanks. Yes, you bet. Very, very relevant question. Thanks for that. I'd say, we'd like in it to more normal levels. I wouldn't necessarily say, de-stocking, restocking, just more normal point of sale pull-through based on retail demand. And I think that's the environment we're getting back to as lead times normalize to more of what the industry is used to. Retail demand pull-through is what's going to drive the stocking levels. Kiran Patel-O'Connor : Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead. Ryan Merkel : Hey, good morning and thanks for taking the questions. My first question is on 4Q. It looks like guidance implies a little bit of a cut there. Can you unpack any changes you made versus prior expectations? Mike Wagnes : Ryan, if you look at Allegion, we always guide for the full-year. In July, we put a guide out there and essentially we reiterated the guide this quarter for the full-year, because we're a full-year guiding company. With respect to Q4, you can back into some math, see strength in the Americas, right, Americas top line guide implied in the high-teens. We are seeing obviously some weakness in that guide internationally, right, which we called-out. So overall, our business is seeing strength in Americas led by obviously non-res, which we talked about and seeing some softening internationally. Full-year, in-line with what we said July. So, I don't think there's major changes from what we told you previously, but you do have some mix between the two regions. Ryan Merkel : Got it. That's helpful. And then for my follow-up, you mentioned progress on supply chain, but still some choppiness. Where are there still issues? And when do you expect to fully catch-up? John Stone : Yes, that's the question of the year, I think, on fully catch up. But I would think of it like this, you know if three or four quarters ago we had like 50 suppliers on the severely delinquent list, today, that would be 7 or 8. Just to kind of quantify it for you, I think the choppiness still exists primarily in semiconductors, microprocessors. Now, the redesign work that Allegion did is obviously having benefits, we're seeing strong electronics growth. Some of those suppliers are performing quite well. Some are still having a lot of issues. And it comes up both in terms of quantity that we need to fully meet retail demand, but then also linearity that we need to really have a productive manufacturing operation. So, that's kind of if we double click into what we mean by choppiness, I'd say this is definitely continuing on into 2023, but we're making progress and we feel good about the progress we've made. We feel good about the improving flexibility and resiliency of our supply base and I think the improvement trend will continue. Ryan Merkel : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho Americas. Please go ahead. Brett Linzey : Hi, good morning all. Mike Wagnes : Good morning. John Stone : Good morning. Brett Linzey : Congrats on a great quarter. Just back to the price and productivity and specifically within the Americas business did step-up nicely from what's 6 million in Q2 to [24 million] [ph] here in the third quarter. Should we see that continue to move higher into Q4? And then given the wraparound price, you should be able to get next year. I mean, should we think of 25 million in Q1 and Q2 of next year at a minimum? Mike Wagnes : Yes. Brett, with respect to next year, we'll give an outlook when we come back in Feb, I'm certainly not on the third quarter call going to get that specific of price productivity inflation. However, in general, think of this dynamic as progressively improving to this point, right? We were weaker last year, negative, got back to positive this quarter on a substantial way.  Obviously, volume drives more ability to get that price because you have more revenue, but in general, we're going to fight that inflation and have that dynamic positive moving forward. Brett Linzey : Got it. And then just back to the backlog question. And so, you're obviously working here to [uncork] [ph] that specifically on the electronic side. As these supplier additions are ramping here, should we think of the electronics growth normalizing back to that double-digit plus level that Allegion has really observed pretty consistently for several years before the pandemic? So, going forward, kind of double-digit in that territory. Mike Wagnes : Yes, especially long-term, this is a great growth driver for us and that be a double-digit growth business for us as you think about the long-term. We talked about choppiness, right, but long-term, this is a double-digit growth opportunity for us. Brett Linzey : And just a quick follow-up, do you think you have enough availability to, kind of sustain that into Q4 here? Mike Wagnes : Yes, I'm not going to guide a specific quarter, but as you looked at our results for the Americas in particular, we have a pretty healthy top line guide in Q4. So, you can draw your conclusions to that particular item, but we still see strength in Q4 as indicated in our guide. Brett Linzey : Appreciate the color. John Stone : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Joe O\u2019Dea with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe O\u2019Dea: Hi, good morning. I wanted to start on the operational and FX piece of the guide. And if you could just, sort of bridge from prior guide to revised guide, I mean, the numbers didn't change, but what some of the moving parts are and given the strength we saw in the third quarter, would have expected to see that that could have moved up, but if you could just talk, kind of the Americas piece, the international piece, the FX piece in terms of what moved from last guide to this one? John Stone : Yes. So, Joe, if you think about FX, we actually took down our guidance in July when we reported our Q2 results for currency. So, a good chunk of the currency pressure you seeing with the dollar strengthening, we anticipated and put in that guidance that we put out in July.  Currency rates have gotten a little worse since that period of time, but a good chunk of the FX pressure we called out previously. And then with respect to operations, we're right online with what we said in July for the year. Obviously, like I mentioned earlier, a little more strength in Americas as we took up the revenue outlook there, and a little more pressure from the markets internationally. Joe O\u2019Dea: Okay. And then I wanted to ask on the Americas margin, excluding Access Tech, clearly some nice progress that we saw sequentially, but when we go back to where, kind of pre-pandemic margins were, there still now appears be some good opportunity there. So, again kind of bridging to that, I mean, what are the keys to, sort of get back to those kinds of margins pretty good volume this quarter. I'm not sure sort of mix side of things. If still from a price productivity inflation, there's room to go and you have visibility into that. It's kind of a timeline to getting back to where your margins were. Mike Wagnes : Yes. If you think about the margin profile in Americas, the strong contribution margin those businesses have as we grow, we should get margin expansion. We've done a much better job this year driving the price realization and offset the inflation. We've been talking about this all year on these calls. We expect that to continue. So, we think that there's margin runway for the Americas and we'll continue to drive that pricing to offset inflation with an understanding that this has been the most significant inflationary environment I've ever personally experienced and we're going to have to just combat that with pricing actions. John Stone : And Joe, this is John. I'd add that again there's an electronics angle to this as well. Electrified and connected products are delivering substantially higher value to the end customer, which then should also be not just organic growth on the top line, but also a margin expansion opportunity too as electronics adoption continues. So, that's an element as well that we're really keen to continue to grow, and deliver more value to the customer. Joe O\u2019Dea: Just related to that, do you think you're capturing that value proposition today or do you think there are opportunities to, sort of better capture that margin opportunity on the electronic side? John Stone : I think both. I think we're doing very well today and I think there's continued opportunity. That's a tailwind for Allegion. Joe O\u2019Dea: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Joe Nolan : Hey, good morning. This is Joe Nolan on for David MacGregor. Mike Wagnes : Hi, Joe. Joe Nolan : First, I just wanted to ask within the Americas group, can you talk about volume versus price trends for both the non-res and residential businesses? Mike Wagnes : Yes. Historically, we don't disclose those individual components. What we did share for the quarter was, they were both up pricing and volume for each segment, but the individual numbers historically we have not and don't anticipate disclosing that level of detail. Joe Nolan : Okay, got it. And then just on the Access Technologies business, I realize it's still early from an integration standpoint, but can you just give any update about how that's going in terms of the integration? John Stone : Yes, I appreciate that question. I think as we said in the prepared comments, off to a great start, our teams are gelling very well. There's this or the other small project win here and there. So \u2013 and I think the early work on some of the heavy lift in terms of systems and things like this will continue for the next many months, but off to a very good start, cultural fit is very good, strategic fit is very good, the automatic doors is an excellent complementary portfolio to the rest of Allegion. And just really excited for that team. And really excited for the services business that comes along with that. And we're quite bullish on the future there. Joe Nolan : All right, great. Thanks for answering my questions. Operator : Last question is from Brian Ruttenbur with Imperial Capital. Please go ahead. Brian Ruttenbur : Yes. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Can we talk a little bit about the competitive landscape right now? What you're seeing given the ASSA ABLOY [HII Spectrum] [ph] transaction appears to be at least held up some with the DOJ, can you talk about the opportunity that you see out there with Allegion and the competitive environment? Are you gaining market share, losing market share, because of this transaction or it doesn't impact you at all? John Stone : Yes, it's certainly not appropriate for us to comment on that particular situation. I would say we feel good about our product portfolio, about our brands, about our competitive position in the market. I think our third quarter results reflect that that as we made the supply chain improvements, we continue to talk about, we generate good results. We've been saying for several quarters now, we were supply constrained versus demand constrained. And I think that continued to prove itself out. And so, yes, we'll continue to compete vigorously in the segments where we compete. And I think Allegion's best days are still ahead. Brian Ruttenbur : Okay. As a follow-up, I'll go in a different direction. Then can we talk about \u2013 you addressed a little bit, but price increases going forward, are you starting to see a pushback on the non-residential market yet in the Americas on price increases and that, kind of tells you when you're done? And I just want to get kind of an indication from you what you see in terms of price indication, price increases going forward if you feel like you can push more through or you feel like that you're at the top end of that market? Mike Wagnes : Yes. We put a number of increases in. I would say it all depends on what the future inflationary environment is, but as we sit here today, we would always communicate future price increases to the channel for an earnings call, but expect us if inflation persists, expect us to pass along pricing to mitigate that, but it all depends on the inflationary environment moving forward. Brian Ruttenbur : Great. Thank you. Operator : This concludes our Q&A session, and we like to turn conference back over to John Stone for any closing remarks. John Stone : Thanks very much and thanks everyone for attending today. I would just like to again reiterate; we feel like we delivered an outstanding performance this quarter. The entire Allegion team and our distribution partners deserve credit for that. Access Technologies awesome acquisition off to a great start. We are making the supply chain improvements that we've been promising for a while and you'd see that reflected in our results. And we see continued strength in the Americas non-residential end markets and global electronics demand. Allegion's best days are still ahead. Thanks very much. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Kevin Sayer, who has been Allegiant's Director of Investor Relations for the past six years has been promoted to the role of Finance Director of our Commercial Americas business. This is a fantastic role for Kevin, who will now serve as our senior finance leader for that business. And I want to express my thanks and appreciation for all of Kevin's support. I'm also pleased to announce the promotion of Joby Coyle to the Director of Investor Relations role. Most recently, Joby has been leading our Americas home finance organization. Effective today, Job is the primary contact for our Investor Relations office. I will continue to lead the Investor Relations function. I would also like to share that Allegion will be hosting a 2023 Investor and Analyst Day on May 2nd of this year. The event will be at our Carmel, Indiana facility, which is in the North Indianapolis Metro area. A webcast option will also be available. Look for more details as we get closer to the event. John and Mike will now discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 results, as well as provide an outlook for 2023, which will be followed by a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Now I'd like to turn the call over to John. John Stone : Thanks, Tom, and let's go to slide four. And first off, congratulations to Kevin, and welcome to Joby. Allegion delivered another outstanding quarter of operational performance. As we look at market dynamics, we continue to see strong demand in the Americas non-residential segments, as well as global electronics. Residential markets continue to be soft with new construction slowing due to inflation and higher interest rates. International end markets are softening as a result of macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions. Our engineering redesigns and alternate supply actions are delivering results and lead times are normalizing on our mechanical products. We're seeing continued improvement in electronic supply, although it's still short of the very strong market demand we're seeing for our products. Price, productivity and inflation dynamic was positive again this quarter on both a dollar and a margin basis as we continue to combat inflation with pricing actions across products and channels. Consistent and efficient available cash flow generation remains a focus for our company. In 2022, we made the decision to protect our customers by investing in inventory, which resulted in a short-term increase in working capital. We're also accelerating certain strategic capital investments to deliver future growth. As a result, available cash flow in 2022 was less than expected. Lastly, to our 2023 outlook, which I'll speak to in more detail later in the presentation, shows revenue growth of 9% to 10.5% with organic growth of 2.5% to 4.5%. Adjusted EPS on a recast basis will be up 5% to 9%. Mike will provide details on the recast in a few minutes. Let's go to slide five. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $861.5 million, an increase of 21.5%, compared to 2021. Organic revenue growth was 11.4%. The organic growth was driven by strong price realization across the portfolio and favorable volume in the Americas non-residential business, offsetting weakness experienced in the Americas residential and international businesses. The Access Technologies acquisition contributed approximately 14% to total growth and currency impacts remain a headwind. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margins increased by 310 basis points each in the fourth quarter. The increases were attributable to favorable price, productivity and inflation dynamic, positive business mix, along with volume leverage associated with the Americas non-residential growth. These factors more than offset the expected margin dilution related to Access Technologies. Excluding the Access Technologies business, adjusted operating income margins were up 430 basis points. Adjusted EPS of $1.60 increased $0.49 or approximately 44% versus the prior year. Strong operational performance more than offset the unfavorable impact of higher interest expense and supported continued investments for growth. Please go to slide six. Building greater supply chain resiliency remains a focus for Allegion from redesigning our products to dual sourcing, we've taken the right actions to strengthen our company and capabilities over the past couple of years. Today, this work continues as we are adding a 350,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Central Mexico. This operation will boost in-region production for our Americas business with core activities like stamping, plating, die cast and assembly. Strategically, this new operation will increase our supply chain resiliency in a number of ways. The plant will be vertically integrated as we will now build components and products in-house that were previously sourced. At the same time, we're driving more efficiency in our supply chain, increasing manufacturing capacity and improving our future cost position. Production is expected to get started later this year, and we could not be more excited about this strategic investment. Mike will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our 2023 outlook. Mike Wagnes : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to slide number seven. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2021, reported earnings per share was $1.26, adjusting down $0.15 per share for a non-cash gain on an investment remeasurement offset by charges related to restructuring, M&A and debt refinancing costs, the 2021 adjusted earnings per share was $1.11. Operational results were very strong in the current quarter, adding $0.48 per share, reflecting 43.2% growth. This was driven by double-digit organic growth, favorable operating leverage and positive business mix, which more than offset currency headwinds. Access Technologies delivered $0.08 to earnings per share as operational results of $0.12 per share were offset by $0.04 of intangible amortization expense. We are pleased with the performance of Access Technologies in the first six months as the business results were in line with our expectations. A lower year-over-year tax rate increased earnings by $0.04 and favorable share count added another $0.03. Interest expense reduced earnings per share by $0.10, primarily driven by increased debt to finance the acquisition of Access Technologies. We continue to invest in the long-term strategy of the business, resulting in a $0.04 earnings per share headwind. This resulted in the fourth quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $1.60, an increase of $0.49 or 44.1%, compared to the prior year. Lastly, we have a $0.07 per share reduction from adjusted EPS to arrive at reported EPS. This reduction is primarily attributed to M&A and additional non-cash purchase accounting items related to the acquisition [Technical Difficulty] of Access Technologies. After giving effect to these items, you arrive at a fourth quarter 2022 reported earnings per share of $1.53. Of note, starting in 2023, we are making a change to our adjusted operating income, earnings and EPS to exclude amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets. This change is based on the non-cash nature of those expenses and supports our growth strategy. Please go to slide number eight. This slide depicts our components of our revenue growth for the fourth quarter, as well as the full-year. As indicated, we experienced 11.4% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter, driven by price across all segments. Volume growth in the Americas mostly offset declines in the international region. Net acquisitions and divestitures delivered 13.4% growth driven by Access Technologies. Currency pressures continued to be a headwind, primarily impacting our Allegion International segment bringing the total reported growth to 21.5% in the quarter. For the full-year, you could see the total revenue was up 14.1% with organic revenue growth of 10.7%. Both segments grew organically for the year, led by Allegion Americas, which grew 14.4%. Please go to slide number nine. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas segment was $683.9 million, up 36.9% on a reported basis and up 18% organically. Price realization remains strong in both our residential and non-residential businesses offsetting ongoing inflationary pressure. In non-residential, we continue to see strong volume growth that when coupled with price, drove organic growth in the mid-20%. Residential was up low-single-digits with favorable price being offset by lower volumes. Electronics revenue was up approximately 50% for the quarter as we compare against supply chain headwinds in the prior year. Full-year electronics growth was approximately 20% and as our engineering and supply chain actions are yielding good results. We are pleased with the ongoing access technologies integration and results. This business contributed nearly 20% to the Americas reported growth number. Americas adjusted operating income of $164.4 million increased 55.8% versus the prior year period, while adjusted operating margins and adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter were up 290 basis points and 320 basis points, respectively. Excluding Access Technologies, the business drove a 530-basis point improvement in operating margins versus the prior year. Pricing productivity in excess of inflation along with volume leverage on America's non-residential business and positive mix contributed to the margin improvement. Please go to slide number 10. Fourth quarter revenue for our Allegion International segment was $177.6 million, down 15.3% on a reported basis and down 4.3% organically. In the quarter, strong price realization was more than offset by lower volumes attributed to softening end markets. Notably, the demand for our electronic and software solutions remain stable. Currency headwinds persisted this quarter and reduced reported revenues by 9.9%. International adjusted operating income of $23.3 million decreased 20.7% versus the prior year period. Compared to 2021, adjusted operating margins and adjusted EBITDA margins decreased 90-basis points each. The margin decline was driven by reduced volumes and FX pressure, which more than offset the favorable impact of the combination of price, productivity and inflation. Please go to slide number 11. Available cash flow for 2022 came in at $395.5 million, down $47.7 million versus the prior year. This reduction is driven by higher capital expenditures, as well as increases in working capital. Given the inconsistencies in the supply chain and component availability, we increased inventory to protect our customers in 2022. When combined with the added working capital of the Access Technologies acquisition, there is an increase in working capital as a percent of revenue. We expect this to improve in 2023 as supply chains disruptions moderate. Capital expenditures as a percent of revenue also increased as we made strategic investments to drive future growth and improve supply chain resiliency like our new production facility in Central Mexico mentioned earlier. The last chart on the slide shows our net leverage. The net debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased from 1.7 times in 2021 to 3.3 times following the Access Technologies acquisition. We have quickly delevered post acquisition and are down to 2.5 times as of the end of the year. The business continues to generate strong cash flow, providing the opportunity for capital deployment with a focus on organic investment and acquisitions. Previously, our Board declared a dividend increase of approximately 10% in the dividend payable in March. I will now hand it back over to John for our 2023 outlook. John Stone : Thanks, Mike. Let's go to slide 12 and take a look at full-year 2023 outlook. In the Americas, we expect to see total growth in the low to mid-teens with organic growth being approximately 4% to 6%. Electronics growth is expected to be strong as we've made significant progress working through supply chain challenges and demand and our backlogs remain robust. We do, however, expect some choppiness of component supply to continue throughout 2023. Non-residential market demand in the Americas continues to be strong heading into the year. We expect growth in the mid to high-teens for our non-res business, inclusive of our Access Technologies acquisition and high single-digits organically. Given the strength we saw in the second half of 2022, we expect stronger growth in the first-half with moderated growth in the second half, up against tougher comps. As communicated last quarter, residential markets have softened we expect our residential business to be down slightly, driven by the slowdown of single-family new construction. In the International segment, we expect relatively flat revenue as end markets continue to soften driven by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. We project total revenue for international to be in the minus 1% to plus 1% range with organic revenue between minus 2% and flat. All in for the company, we are projecting total revenue to be up between 9% and 10.5%, organic revenue growth of 2.5% to 4.5%. Our 2023 outlook for adjusted earnings per share is expected to be between $6.30 and $6.50. This is inclusive of the reporting change effective January 1 of this year to exclude all acquisition-related amortization. Adjusted operational earnings are expected to increase 9% to 12%, driven by volume leverage and price and productivity exceeding inflation and investments. Interest is expected to be around a $0.24 per share headwind, reflecting a full-year of acquisition-related borrowings and increases to variable interest rates. Tax is expected to be a $0.20 headwind and other income is expected to be around a $0.05 headwind. The outlook assumes approximately $0.20 per share for costs related to restructuring and M&A and amortization expense related to acquired backlog. In addition, it excludes approximately $0.40 per share for acquired intangible asset amortization. As a result, reported EPS is projected to be between $5.70 and $5.90. Lastly, we're expecting available cash flow for 2023 to be in the $470 million to $490 million range. Let's go to slide 13. So in summary, we delivered significant growth in the fourth quarter, and we expect to see continued growth into 2023. Our electronic solutions are well received in the market, we continue to see very strong demand and we expect this to be a long-term growth driver for our company. As a late-cycle business, the Allegion Americas non-residential market demand is solid. We're well positioned for 2023. We're excited about a full-year with Access Technologies and love the recurring service aspect of that business. Operating margins have been improving, and we expect that trend to continue into 2023. We are accelerating investments in new product development, software capabilities and supply chain resiliency, all of which support the health of our business and the creation of long-term shareholder value. Overall, the entire team at Allegion, along with our distribution partners had a great finish to 2022, and we're headed into 2023 with the right velocity and momentum. With that, we're happy to turn to Q&A. Operator : We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe O'Dea: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. John Stone : Good morning, Joe. Mike Wagnes : Hi, Joe. Joe O'Dea: I wanted to -- hi, just wanted to start on sort of Americas non-res end markets trends you've seen sort of in the year-end, the beginning of this year. If you could talk about color across verticals, I think seeing sort of ABI sub-50 for four months, looks like Dodge momentum remains pretty strong. I think we're hearing about some mix toward bigger projects. So just kind of what you're seeing kind of institutional side, commercial side with visibility into 2023. John Stone : Yes, that's the right question, Joe. Thank you very much. This is John. What I would say is probably we're seeing the same trends on ABI as you are, and that would tend to telegraph what the market's doing 9 to 12 months from now. So we're watching that, of course, very carefully. I would say the present situation right now is there is a lot of construction activity going on. And we're pretty heavy institutional. And so what we see is, if you look at things like the association of building contractors, construction backlog, while it's sequentially down just a little bit, it's still looking at historical trends quite elevated, which means there's a lot of activity. And that index, I would tell you is quite consistent with what we hear from our distribution partners. It's what we're hearing from our folks out in the regional sales offices that there's a lot of project business out there, and we feel very well positioned to capture it. Joe O'Dea: That's helpful. And then just wanted to touch on growth investments in 2023, just from a capability and end market perspective, where some of those growth investments are focused? Mike Wagnes : Yes. So really good question. We'll take an organic angle at it first. And I would say we feel like we're a leader in electromechanical products. So continuing to invest on the R&D side in those products and those capabilities, continue to build that portfolio. You saw -- I hope you saw in January, we did close on our acquisition of Plano in Germany, kind of, building more of our Software-as-a-Service business there in the International segment. And I think you can continue to expect us to be more acquisitive in the future. I think that's definitely something we're interested in. Pipeline feels pretty good. But of course, these things are rather episodic in nature. So we take it as the right asset comes available at the right price. I would take you back to in the deck the facility that we're building in Central Mexico. That's essentially in-sourcing and near-shoring previously sourced product. And that facility has a lot of expansion capability to it. So as we ramp up production there, we'll have a better cost position on some of our mechanical products and then future products to be built there yet to be seen. But I think we're quite excited about that from an organic growth perspective as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Vivek Srivastava : Good morning. This is Vivek Srivastava on for Joe Ritchie. Thank you for the question. My first question is on the residential pricing. It looks like this quarter pricing was basically offset by volume. If you can provide some color on how the realized pricing is progressing, especially on the big box side of the business? And how should we think about 2023 here as we think about pricing? Mike Wagnes : Yes. Thanks for the question. As you think about our residential business historically, say, before 2022, we've struggled to get price in residential, and we made it a focus area to drive pricing due to all the inflationary pressures we had. We had the strongest price realization I can recall in my decade-plus here in residential in 2022. And we expect to see price realization next year as well. So as we deal with inflationary pressures, look for us to combat that with pricing, and we've had significant progress in that area across the entire portfolio in 2022, moving into 2023, we expect that to continue. Vivek Srivastava : That's great to hear. And maybe just a follow-up there, especially on the any destock risk on the residential side? Any -- has any of the destock happened already? Or do you expect some in 2023? John Stone : So I think -- this is John. Kind of two things going on there in that channel. I think on the mechanical side, again, you heard earlier in the call, our lead times are essentially back to normal. So book and ship business, retail point-of-sale pull-through. Certainly, on a volume basis, particularly on the mechanical side, it's a little softer. There is no doubt. On the electronics side, again, demand is very strong. Backlogs are still elevated. And in all honesty, we still have -- by historical values, we still have shelf space to fill with electronic products, both on the commercial side and the residential side. So I think there's -- again, electronics will continue to be a growth driver for the company in all segments. Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Linzey from Mizuho Americas. Please go ahead. Brett Linzey : Hey, good morning, all. John Stone : Good morning. Mike Wagnes : Good morning, Brett. Brett Linzey : Yes, just wanted to come back to the pricing discussion. Mike, I think you touched on pricing expectations for residential. But thinking more broadly about the portfolio and actions into 2023. How are you thinking about additional pricing for this year? And then specifically, within the whole framework, what do you think in for price realization this year? Mike Wagnes : Brett, as we've talked over time, we're committed to fight that inflationary pressure we see. We expect price realization -- substantial price realization in 2023 and such that, that price, productivity, inflation and investment dynamic is a net positive. You've heard me talk about this for at least 6 months now. We've made good momentum in '22, and we're set up nicely for '23 such that we have a net positive of those 4 characteristics or those 4 items. Brett Linzey : Okay. Got it. And just wanted to follow-up on the Mexico facility for stamping, plating, et cetera. In terms of identifiable paybacks, how are you thinking about the potential cost savings as you look into \u201824 and \u201825? Or what that payback might look like? John Stone : Yes. It's the right question. I think payback is going to be pretty quick. I mean, these are high-volume products and the cost reduction that we're looking at is substantial. I'm not going to give you the exact down to the penny number, but it's substantial. And we see, because of that, a favorable impact on margins and a favorable impact on market share in those segments. It's -- we're quite excited about getting this facility ramped up. Mike Wagnes : And Brett, just to add, if you think about 2023 because the facility is going to come online later in the year, that margin benefit and that cost benefit, that's more of a \u201824, \u201825 benefit. If you think about \u201823, think of there is some investment in start-up costs as you bring a new facility up and running during the year, but this is a great long-term investment like John mentioned. So I just wanted to add that color. Operator : Our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Please go ahead. David MacGregor : Yes, good morning, everyone. I just wanted to continue on the pricing. And in response to the last couple of questions. You made it very clear that you're pushing much harder on pricing. But can you just talk about that in terms of price cost expectations and what you've got reflected in your full year guidance? Maybe talk about how that should phase over the 4 quarters. Mike Wagnes : Yes. As you think about it for next year, definitely positive. Obviously, price cost will be better in the first half because of the prior year comparable. And then if you think about quarters, we try not to guide quarters. But think of it as price cost inflation and investments, \u2018this is a net positive for us moving forward. We fell behind last year, right, in 2021. '22, we caught up, we made some positive traction at the end of the year, and now we're set up nicely moving forward and expect this dynamic to continue to be positive. David MacGregor : Good. Just as a follow-up, I guess, maybe talk about Access Technologies and maybe the progress to date? And how are you reflecting that acquisition in your 2023 growth and margin guidance? Mike Wagnes : So if you look at the first half of the year, that would be considered inorganic growth. And so on the slide in the presentation, we show a delta between reported and organic for the Americas, that inorganic would be Access Tech. The back half of the year, it will be part of organic growth and is included in that non-residential number John mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks. So it's a combination of both the first half is that inorganic growth. John Stone : Yes. Strategically, David, it's a great fit. We've retained the key talent. We've retained the key customers. We're working very, very hard on getting these automatic doors into this very powerful Allegion spec engine. That team is super excited to be here. We're super excited to have him. And again, you've got a very robust recurring service business as a part of that acquisition that we're really excited about. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Hey, thank you. Good morning, everyone. John Stone : Hey, Jeff. Mike Wagnes : Hi, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Good morning. Just a couple for me, if I could. Just first, back to price cost and everybody has asked the question a couple of times. But I just want to be clear really on your volume expectations for the year. It would seem we could get two or pretty close to your organic revenue growth just on carryover price. And the fact that I would think you've also got some positive mix effects on revenue as electronics ramps up. So perhaps you could just give us a little bit more color on what you're expecting for volumes for the year. Mike Wagnes : Yes. Jeff, if you think of the non-residential business in the Americas, still going to see volume growth, good end markets. If you think about international and residential, they're a little softer. So think of any form of growth coming more from the price there, all in weighted more towards pricing like you suggested than volume. But the non-res side and electronics, that's where the volume growth will be driven. Jeff Sprague : Great. And then actually, I just wanted to ask a little bit of a philosophical question about going to ex-amort and I agree it's the right thing to do, ultimately, particularly given a lot of other folks do it. But the main premise of it is, right, that amortization is non-cash. So when I go to adjusted EPS, my earnings and my cash flow are then, in fact, similar, right? And the EPS is kind of an economic number. You're only going to convert at about 85% free cash flow to adjusted net income this year according to your guide. Do you -- and it's certainly understandable supply chain inventories elevated and the like. But do you see those numbers converging over time? And getting the organization to, I don't know, 95% to 100% conversion to adjusted net income. Mike Wagnes : Yes. So Jeff, historically, when we looked at it at reported net income, that was in the low-90s based on the current guide on the reported net income, it's mid-90s. I would say, longer term, we do expect it to be better. We do have an increase in capital expenditures this year. So if you think of depreciation versus CapEx, CapEx is elevated. Think of it as 2.5% plus of revenue. We're building a new facility. That's not something we do every single day, so it is a little lighter, because a higher level of CapEx. But longer term, think of us as focusing on, especially as we make M&A, the cash returns of these acquisitions. We've been talking about Access Tech for almost a year now. And it's -- the ability to drive cash earnings from those acquisitions rather than a non-cash charge. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Snyder from UBS. Please go ahead. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I want to follow-up on the previous question around the Americas organic growth guide of 4% to 6%. Can you just, I guess, specifically talk about the split between volume and price within that? Because my math is kind of similar to Jeff. It feels like Americas can get there on just wrap around price alone, and it sounds like there is scope for incremental price as well. Mike Wagnes : Yes. So when you think about 2023 and pricing. Clearly, we had good momentum coming into the year. We have more pricing than volume growth. Residential is when you build your models, don't forget, starts have been down considerably there in the residential space. So residential volume is going to be more challenged, right? So overall, the volume growth coming from non-res in the total segment, I don't want to give subsegment targets for volume versus price. But I would just say the total segment is more pricing than volume when you build your models. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I appreciate that. And then maybe for my follow-up, just around the cadence of America's organic growth as the year goes on. So it certainly feels like organic growth in the first-half of the year will be stronger in the back half, just on the easier price comps. But could you just provide some more color on that trajectory? And does the guidance imply that Q4 will be negative organic for the Americas? Thank you. Mike Wagnes : Yes. So if you look at our history, we're not going to guide quarters. I would say this 2022 very back-end loaded. Our historical norms for the Americas is probably more indicative of what you think 2023 would look like from a percent of the total. As a result, you'll see more revenue growth in the first-half than the second-half, but we do expect to see growth in the back half of the year. Operator : The next question comes from Tim Tojs from Baird. Please go ahead. Tim Tojs : Hey, good morning, [Indiscernible]. Maybe just on backlog. Just maybe if you can give us a little bit of flavor for where backlog is maybe versus a year ago? And I know there's some noise in there just from the supply chain, kind of, constraints. But just maybe any color on the trajectory of that backlog through the year would be helpful. Mike Wagnes : Yes. So Tim, we ended last year very elevated backlogs, especially in electronics and mechanical, that's 2021. If you think about \u201822, we worked through the excess mechanical backlog such that lead times are normal. Demand is good, lead times are normal. So it's where we want to be from a health of a business. If you think of electronics, electronics does have elevated backlogs at the end of 2022, which is attributable to both supply challenges, but as well as really strong demand. And so we do have elevated backlogs in electronics, which will give us tailwinds for both and frankly, \u201824. This is a long-term trend moving for us. Tim Tojs : Okay, okay. So it sounds like you've burned off most of the kind of buildup from \u201821 and now it's just stronger demand. Mike Wagnes : On the mechanical side, yes. Tim Tojs : Yes. Okay, okay. Got you. And then John, maybe just bigger picture. I mean, you've been CEO now for six to nine months. And now that you've gotten maybe a little bit more settle into role. Just maybe some color on any potential strategic changes or tweaks that you think you might make with the business going forward. John Stone : Yes, absolutely. I think these last two quarters, it's really been a pleasure being here, working with the Allegion team and working with these distribution partners out there. I think what you should see is a lot of the things that built Allegion's reputation since spin of outstanding operational execution, year-over-year expanding margins. Those kind of things will continue. What we're looking to do is continue to orient the company towards growth and allocate capital towards growth. That means driving organic growth. That means continue to look for us and expect us to be acquisitive and really leading with our technology. Allegion got a fabulous electromechanical portfolio. We've got extremely talented engineers. We feel like we're a leader in that space, and we'll continue to be a leader in that space. So organic growth, inorganic growth through M&A, I think that's what you need to expect us to layer on top of the operational excellence that you're used to from Allegion. And this year-on-year ability to drive above-market growth and continue to expand margins. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hey, good morning, guys. John Stone : Good morning. Mike Wagnes : Good morning, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : So John, you talked a few times about the visibility in the non-res business, particularly on electronics with the elevated backlog. Just wondering if you could give us sort of any view on where backlog levels stand? Or how you think about conversion or something like book-to-bill in the framework this year? John Stone : Yes. So I think, again, on the mechanical side of the portfolio, we're -- you put air quotes around it back to what you would expect a book and ship business. So very efficient, very lean book and ship business. Electronics demand is still very, very strong, and that's globally. And supply limited is still where we are. We've got -- and I think quarter-to-quarter, month-to-month made continuous progress on that. And that's why you see the kind of year-over-year growth numbers that you've seen in Q3, Q4 of \u201822. We're very bullish on that portfolio, and we're continuing to invest and refresh the products. So we do expect demand to continue to remain strong. We do expect conversion and adoption to continue to grow. That being said, of course, there are parts of a building. There are parts of Allegion's portfolio that will never be electrified. So it doesn't just go from some state to 100% electric. But electronics will continue to be a double-digit growth driver for the company and that gives us a pretty interesting avenue to continue to build out Software-as-a-Service, like you see with our Enerflex and our Plano acquisition. So I'd say, again, look for us to continue to be acquisitive and build on this advantage that we feel we've got with the electronic products. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. Looking forward to hearing more about that at the Investor Day as well. On the margin guide in the Americas or I guess implicit in the guide overall, how do we think about sort of what's an easy comp and timing elements around things like either price/cost or miss shipments, productivity versus just kind of volume leverage. Is there any way you guys would sort of break down those buckets of what just comes from kind of the absence of the bad guys versus some of this healthy mix, price/cost, some of the other things you're talking about. Mike Wagnes : Yes, Josh. Clearly, first half, we're going to see more margin expansion, due to the easier comp. Look for us, though, for all quarters to be driving pricing and productivity in excess of that inflation and investment number on a dollar basis. And when you think about expansion, Americas margin expansion will be more front half loaded year-over-year. Operator : The next question comes from Ryan Merkel from William Blair. Please go ahead. Ryan Merkel : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to pick up on the electronics demand. Can you just talk about some of the key drivers is the strength in both resi and commercial? And then what are the features and benefits that are really resonating with customers? John Stone : Yes, it's a great question. Maybe start with residential. I think the rise of the mega tech smart home ecosystems, the two most popular products that you find connected to those systems would be thermostats and locks. People might do other things, but those two fundamental elements seem like the most popular the functionality you get with a phone connected to your smart -- excuse me, a phone connected to your lock, the visibility of the state of that lock the peace of mind aspect that, that gives you, I think that's quite attractive to a lot of folks. On the non-res side, it's -- I mean, this is a B2B environment. So here, you're talking about like real economic value add for the end user. So think about a multifamily residential setting, an apartment complex rather than the landlord managing and swapping out metal keys. You can do this all digitally now with digital credentials, mobile credentials. It's just -- there's operating cost savings there that will continue to drive adoption in spaces like that. So -- on the non-res side, this is real economic benefits that are delivered over time. Residential side, peace of mind, visibility, higher tech connected to my smart home, et cetera. Those trends are, I think, still in the early stages of a traditional S-curve of adoption and a nice long runway ahead of us. Ryan Merkel : That's helpful. Thanks. And then on supply chain, just where are the pinch points in electronics? Do you have any visibility to when that improves and the investment in working capital. Is that primarily in electronics? John Stone : So the supply chain, the way I described it last quarter, the same way I'll describe it this quarter of a year ago. We had 50 suppliers on the delinquent list that was shutting our assembly lines down on any given day. Today, that number is down to a handful, three or four. So that's the order of magnitude of improvement. The constraint is the semiconductors themselves, microprocessors in particular. And it's just been a matter of the industrial Internet-of-Things, that space has had extremely strong demand, while you've probably seen news headlines and other things about some foundries or chip manufacturers seeing softening demand, that\u2019s from things like consumer goods and mobile phones, these much smaller, much more advanced, much more expensive chips. But these chips that hit the sweet spot of cost and power and performance for the industrial IoT, which is like what we use in our products. That demand has still outstripped supply and capacity all the way back to the foundries. We've been working very closely to do a couple of things. One would be expand the quantity of supply that's been improving. The other thing has also improved the visibility and the linearity of deliveries. So then our factories can run a bit more efficiently and we can bring our lead times down. So it goes all the way back to the semiconductor itself, and that's the value chain we're trying to work through and continue to make improvements. And we're happy with the improvement so far, but we're still supply constrained versus very strong demand. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Rittenberg from Imperial Capital, please -- I'm sorry, Brian Ruttenbur from Imperial Capital. Brian Ruttenbur : Okay, thank you very much. So one other question on the residential side in 2023. It looks like it's going to be driven by pricing. Can you talk a little bit about -- you say it's primarily driven by pricing. Will volumes actually be down? And could they be down 2% to 3%, 4% or 5% and you still hit that -- your goals for 2023 on the residential side? Mike Wagnes : Yes. Brian, I really don't want to give the subcomponents for res, non-res, but if you think about it, I would say you're approximating a reasonable outlook for res in that it's going to be price driven and that volume will be challenged. But I don't want to give individual components between res and non-res. Brian Ruttenbur : Okay. And then along those same lines, have you experienced on the residential side or even the international side, any debooking in the fourth quarter where you've just heard about some debooking in the residential side, and I didn't want to kind of get your color on that, if there's been any debooking and you've seen a recovery post fourth quarter? Mike Wagnes : If you think about our residential business, electronics, clearly, there's shelf space to be filled, as John talked about. On the mechanical side, what we have seen is slowing there again to the overall numbers we talked about residential. As far as de bookings, we have not seen a lot of cancellations from customers more think of it as slowing down in the consumer making purchases there. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Stone for any closing remarks. John Stone : Thanks very much. So to wrap up, what you heard today, Allegion Americas non-residential demand remains robust. Global electronics demand remains very strong. Our supply chains are improving, and our products are very well received in the market. Access Technologies acquisition is continuing to perform very well. We, along with our distribution partners had a great finish to 2022 and feel that we're favorably positioned for 2023. Thank you very much for joining the call, and have a great day. Operator : Conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Martineau, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead. Tom Martineau : Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Allegion\u2019s first quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are John Stone, President and Chief Executive Officer and Mike Wagnes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we will refer to in today\u2019s call, are available on our website at investor.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website. Please go to Slides 2 and 3. Statements made in today\u2019s call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our most recent SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Today\u2019s presentation and commentary include non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details. Please go to Slide 4. And I will turn the call over to John. John Stone : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Allegion delivered another quarter of outstanding operational performance. We reported revenue roughly 27% up and adjusted EPS growth of nearly 40%. Looking at our markets, we see ongoing robust demand in our North America non-residential business, along with strong demand globally for our electronic solutions. We are seeing improvement in electronics components availability. And although supply is still short of demand, Americas Electronics Solutions grew by more than 30% this quarter. Residential markets remain rather soft in the quarter, particularly for the mechanical products and certain international markets also remain soft, particularly our global portable security business, which Mike will address in a few slides. We expanded margins substantially, up 290 basis points versus prior year. This now represents the fourth quarter in a row of margin expansion for Allegion as pricing momentum continues and efficiency and productivity are accelerating. We remain committed to expanding margins for 2023 and beyond, as you\u2019ll hear on our Investor Day next week. We also realized significant improvement in cash flow year-over-year driven by its favorable earnings and better operating efficiencies. We are raising our outlook for the year on revenue, EPS and cash flow given strong Q1 execution, resilient market demand in non-residential segments, improving electronics availability amid the ongoing industry transformation to electronic smart hardware. Please go to Slide 5. Revenue for the first quarter was $923 million, an increase of 27.6% compared to \u201822. Organic growth of 15% was driven by favorable volume in the Americas non-residential business and strong price realization across the portfolio. The Access Technologies acquisition contributed approximately 14% to total growth and currency impacts remained a headwind. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margins in the first quarter increased by 290 basis points and 270 basis points respectively. The increases were attributable to favorable price and productivity, positive business mix and volume leverage associated with Americas non-residential growth. Excluding the acquisition of Access Technologies, adjusted operating income margins were up 380 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.58 increased $0.45 or approximately 40% versus the prior year. Strong operational performance more than offset the unfavorable impact of anticipated higher interest and tax expense. As previously mentioned, available cash flow was $46.7 million in the quarter, up nearly 300% versus the prior year. Mike will now walk you through the financial results and I\u2019ll be back to discuss our updated 2023 outlook. Mike Wagnes : Thanks, John and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining today\u2019s call. Please go to Slide #6. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter of 2022, reported earnings per share was $1.05. After $0.08 of adjustments for the items noted on this slide, 2022 adjusted EPS was $1.13. Operational results were strong in the quarter, adding $0.46 per share, which drove approximately 40% growth. This was driven by double-digit organic revenue growth, favorable operating execution and positive business mix, which more than offset currency headwinds. Acquisitions and divestitures delivered $0.13 to earnings \u2013 of earnings per share. This was primarily driven by Access Technologies, which continues to deliver strong results. Interest expense reduced earnings per share by $0.11 driven by increased debt to finance the acquisition of Access Technologies and higher variable interest rates versus Q1 2022. A higher year-over-year tax rate reduced earnings by $0.03. This resulted in first quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $1.58, an increase of $0.45 or 39.8% compared to the prior year. Lastly, as detailed on the page, we have an $0.18 per share reduction from adjusted EPS to arrive at reported EPS. As we discussed in our last earnings call, this amount now includes an adjustment for all acquisition-related amortization. After giving effect to these items, you arrive at first quarter 2023 reported earnings per share of $1.40. Please go to Slide #7. This slide depicts our revenue growth for the first quarter. I will talk to the results in total on this slide and address the regions on their respective slides. We delivered 15% organic growth driven by price realization across the portfolio and strong volume growth in the Americas non-residential business. Net acquisition and divestitures contributed 14.1% growth driven by Access Technologies. Currency pressures continue to be a headwind, primarily impacting our International segment bringing the total reported growth to 27.6% in the quarter. Please go to Slide #8. First quarter revenue for the Americas segment was $740.9 million, up 42% on a reported basis and up 22.6% organically. During the first quarter, price realization remained strong, offsetting ongoing inflationary pressures. In non-residential, we continue to see strong end market demand and volume growth, which benefited from the catch-up of improved electronic component supply. When coupled with price, this drove organic growth to approximately 30%. Our residential business was up mid single-digits, with favorable price offsetting lower volumes. Residential electronics volume growth was strong, but we continue to see weakness in end markets for mechanical products. Electronics growth exceeded 30% for the quarter as we continue to see both improvements in our supply chain and strong demand. Backlogs for non-residential electronic solutions remain elevated as we exit Q1 as demand is still limited by supply availability. Additionally, we expect residential electronics demand to be more aligned to retail point-of-sale as we go forward. We are pleased with the ongoing Access Technologies integrations and results. This business had pro forma revenue growth of approximately 15% versus Q1 2022 and contributing nearly 20% to the Americas reported growth number. We continue to see the benefits of a stable high-growth service business that Access Technologies provides us and the business is performing as well as we anticipated when we purchased it. Americas adjusted operating income of $198.1 million increased 59.5% versus the prior year period, while adjusted operating margins and adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter were up 290 and 260 basis points respectively. Excluding Access Technologies, the Americas segment drove 500 basis point improvement in operating margins versus the prior year. Pricing productivity in excess of inflation and investments, volume leverage, along with positive mix, contributed to the margin improvement. Please go to Slide #9. First quarter revenue for Allegion International segment was $182.1 million, down 9.7% on a reported basis and down 4.8% organically. In the quarter, solid price realization was more than offset by lower volumes, primarily associated with our Portable Securities business. This business benefited from a COVID-related demand surge that extended into the first half of 2022. This resulted in the first half of 2023 having a more difficult comp as the market works its way back to a more normal cycle. Notably, the demand for our electronics and software solutions remained strong in Allegion International. In addition, currency headwinds persisted this quarter and reduced reported revenues by 4.4%. International adjusted operating income of $19.7 million decreased 27% versus the prior year period. Compared to 2022, adjusted operating margins and adjusted EBITDA margins declined 260 and 220 basis points respectively. The margin decline was primarily driven by reduced volumes. Please go to Slide #10. Year-to-date available cash flow for the first quarter came in at $46.7 million, up $34.9 million versus the prior year. This increase is driven by higher earnings and lower cash used for net working capital partially offset by higher capital expenditures that were mostly related to our new manufacturing facility in Mexico, which is scheduled to come online in the second half of 2023. Working capital as a percent of revenue increased versus the prior year. This is driven partially by the Access Technologies business, which was not owned in Q1 \u201822. Working capital has also increased from Q1 2022 as a result of the investments in inventory we made in the second half of last year to increase our safety stock and protect our customers. We saw a year-over-year and sequential improvement in inventory turns as we remain committed to manage our working capital more efficiently and drive improvement. The business continues to generate strong cash flow and the balance sheet continues to be in a healthy position. I will now hand it back over to John for an update on our full year 2023 outlook. John Stone : Thanks Mike. Please go to Slide 11. We continue to expect strong electronics growth and the non-residential market demand in the Americas remains robust. Given the late cycle nature of our business, we expect this strength to continue through 2023. As a result, we are raising our 2023 outlook for the Americas segment, where we expect organic growth to be between 7.5% to 9.5%. We expect total growth inclusive of our Access Technologies acquisition to be between 15% and 17%. We expect to see non-residential organic growth to be up low double-digits with favorability in both price and volume. We still expect the residential business to be down with price mostly offsetting volume declines, which are expected to be in the low to mid single-digit range. Based on the strength we saw in the second half of 2022, we expect stronger growth in the first half of 2023, which we believe may moderate later in the year against those tougher comparables. There is no change in our outlook for the International segment we expect revenue in that segment to be relatively flat in soft end markets. All-in for the company, we are raising our outlook and expect total revenue growth to be between 11.5% to 13.5%, with organic revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5%. Please go to Slide 12. As a result of our favorable revenue outlook and strong operational execution, we are raising our adjusted EPS outlook for the year and believe it will be between $6.55 and $6.75. Adjusted operational earnings are expected to increase approximately 13% to 16%. Interest is still expected to be around a $0.24 per share headwind, reflecting a full year of acquisition-related borrowings and increases to variable interest rates. Tax still expected to be a $0.20 headwind and other income still expected to be around a $0.05 headwind. The outlook continues to assume approximately $0.20 per share for costs related to restructuring and M&A and amortization expense related to acquired backlog. In addition, it excludes approximately $0.40 per share for acquired intangible asset amortization. As a result, reported EPS is now projected to be between $5.95 to $6.15. Lastly, we are increasing our outlook on available cash flow for the year to be in the $480 million to $500 million range. Please go to Slide 13. To summarize, we see strength in our Americas non-residential business and our global electronics solutions continue to provide us with significant growth opportunities, both near and long-term. We\u2019re very pleased with the performance of our Access Technologies acquisition. The business is performing well, and we love the synergies with our non-res business. We\u2019ve expanded margins for the fourth quarter in a row and remain committed to doing so moving forward. We saw significant improvements in cash flow, and it\u2019s worth mentioning again that we saw improvements in inventory turns in the first quarter of 2023. Overall, we\u2019re off to a great start. In 2023, our team is executing well, and Allegion\u2019s best days are still ahead of us. Please go to Slide 14. And before we turn the call over to Q&A, I\u2019d like to provide a final reminder that you\u2019re all invited to join Mike and myself as well as other members of our executive team next week on Tuesday, May 2 for 2023 Investor and Analyst Day at our Americas headquarters in Carmel, Indiana. There you\u2019ll have the opportunity to learn about our leadership team, our strategy and our exciting work driving seamless access. Formal presentations will be held 12 :30 to 2 :30 Eastern Time. And those who attend in person will also get a pretty exciting tour through our technical center following the presentations. This is a really exciting time in our company\u2019s history. We\u2019re a few months away from turning 10 years old, and our current executive team\u2019s first Investor Day together. We hope to see you there. With that, let\u2019s turn to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just a first question around that non-residential Americas outlook and sort of an update there, so I heard you call out, I think, low double-digit revenue growth assumed for non-resi Americas this year. Maybe help us understand kind of what\u2019s the split between price and volume versus your prior assumption? And also, it seems that your revenues you\u2019re getting this big sort of boost from component supply issues easing? And give us some clarity perhaps about how you\u2019re looking at sort of the spec writing the order flow? There is obviously a lot of investor consternation about commercial construction. So any signs of any change in customer appetite there? Mike Wagnes : Yes. So Julian, why don\u2019t I tackle the kind of the components of the guide, and John can talk to the general business dynamics. If you look at our non-res business, we expect to see both revenue growth driven by price and volume. As you know, we\u2019ve been committed to fight that inflationary pressure. So pricing should be good for the full year. You saw a good pricing in Q1. And then as you look at a full year basis for volume, we will have growth, but not to the level you saw in Q1, obviously. We are running up against that tough comparable in the back half of the year. If you recall, non-resi grew 30% and I think in the third quarter and then greater than 25% in the fourth quarter. So we do have a tougher comparable. And then, John, do you want to talk to the spec activity and other items? John Stone : Yes. Good morning, Julian, thanks for the questions. I think on the supply chain, you\u2019re exactly right. Component supply has been, I\u2019d say, steadily improving, including on the electronic side. And what we\u2019ve been really happy to see is how quickly the Allegion team has essentially compounded every incremental improvement in the supply chain with better productivity, better operating efficiency in the factory. And our distribution channel sell-through has been quite rapid as lead times have come down. So happy to see that. I would say if you look back to the prepared remarks, Mike had some comments around electronics, particularly on the non-res side of electronics, still have elevated lead times, still have elevated backlogs. Supply has improved, quantity has improved. It\u2019s still not as linear as we would like to see it, a bit choppy in terms of deliveries. But demand is still very strong, very robust and exciting future there. On just the general activity, I\u2019d say, leading demand indicators : ABI, Dodge new starts, Dodge Construction Index, AIA consensus still reading rather favorable, honestly, choppy. It\u2019s been mixed last few months. But some of those indices are, again, tipping back favorable here and there. For us, we do see strong spec writing activity, and that\u2019s a flywheel that turns all year, every year. And the time between engaging with the architect, writing a specification and turning that into revenue that can sometimes be 18 to 24 months even. But the spec engine is always running. And right now, it\u2019s running very hard. When you think about quoting, bidding, etcetera, that activity is quite robust as well. So again, we feel good about the non-res business. We feel good about our position in the non-res business through 2023. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. And you did have a very good tailwind in the Americas from that sort of line price and productivity versus inflation and investment spend. I think it was over 300 points in the first quarter as a margin tailwind. So maybe as we think about the balance of the year, how does that \u2013 how quickly does that tailwind shrink? Should it still be a tailwind overall in the fourth quarter or is it more kind of back to neutral there? Just trying to understand some of those moving pieces in what you\u2019re guiding for margins this year? Mike Wagnes : Yes. So if you look at margins for the year, I expect our margins to be up, say, 50 to 100 basis points full year. And in every year moving forward, look for us to drive that margin expansion. You will hear this at Investor Day next week. We\u2019re going to be driving margin expansion moving forward, and we\u2019re committed to doing so. If you look at price productivity inflation investments, that is a big tailwind in Q1. We do have an easier comp in Q1. Obviously, Q3 and Q4, it\u2019s a more challenging comp. I would just add, we expect that to be positive on a dollar basis in the back half of the year. We expect margin expansion for the full year, as I mentioned earlier. And as you think about our business, we are driving the necessary pricing actions to fight the inflationary pressures. We fell a little behind, let\u2019s say, in \u201821 and early \u201822, we\u2019ve taken the necessary actions to ensure that, that doesn\u2019t happen again. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s great. Thank you. John Stone : Thanks, Julian. Operator : The next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Hey, guys. Good morning. John Stone : Hey, Joe. Joe Ritchie : So can we maybe just follow-on on that pricing discussion? Look, it\u2019s been great to see, particularly in the Americas business here, you\u2019ve had double-digit pricing now for three quarters in a row. I\u2019m just curious, like, have you put additional price increases through for this year? And then like how do you see pricing specifically in Americas progressing as the year goes along? Mike Wagnes : Hey, Joe, thanks for the question. If you think about our Americas business, starting late \u201821 and all of \u201822, we\u2019ve put in a substantial amount of pricing actions. We are starting to comp up against those pricing actions in \u201823. So as you move through the year, the realization percentage will be highest in the first quarter and then less as you proceed through the year. You\u2019re still going to sell the product at a higher value, but the incremental price realization percent will come down. We do expect our pricing to be very sticky. As you remember, our non-residential business, we do list price adjustments that tend to stick. So we feel good about our pricing, but the magnitude will decline the amount of price realization as we progress through the year. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Alright. Great. Helpful. And then my follow-on question, like back to the consternation in the market right now on non-res. Your commentary so far have been very positive as you think about the year. I guess maybe just provide a little bit more color how you\u2019re thinking about the potential risk of a slowdown associated with middle market banking concerns and when you would potentially see that in your business with the leading indicators are that you\u2019re looking at? John Stone : Yes, Joe, this is John. It\u2019s a good question. And it\u2019s top of mind for everyone. I would say, again, if you think about Allegion\u2019s business model, we are late cycle. We are a bit heavily weighted to the institutional segment, which tends to have sources of financing like bond referendums, public finance or these mega projects with large bank finance. So there is part of the business that maybe is not all that susceptible to the regional banks. And certainly, a lot of the business is susceptible to regional bank lending and credit conditions. So could that become an issue? Of course. Are we seeing a big impact right now? No, we\u2019re not. Again, think about engaging with the architect, writing specifications of the classic pull strategy to pull the product through the channel. The timing from spec to project initiation to when doors and door hardware goes in the building can be 12, 18, 24 months. And so projects that have been started tend to get completed, and I think we\u2019re seeing that right now. Joe Ritchie : Makes lot of sense. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Hi, thank you. Good morning. John Stone : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hey, good morning. My question actually kind of picks up a little bit on some of that last point, John. Can you actually see kind of stimulus flowing into those institutional markets or kind of anything else that gives you maybe more visibility than you would typically have at this point in time? John Stone : Yes, that\u2019s a good question. And I think it\u2019s always tricky to see. When we sell through distribution, you\u2019re not quite sure the source of the project, the source of the financing. We\u2019re \u2013 like \u2013 anyway, I\u2019d say you see stimulus in airport terminal renewals, that was a big part of the Infrastructure and Jobs Act. You know there is funding going to higher ed through the emergency relief fund back from the COVID days to help with contactless, touchless, which goes very well into seamless access and electronic locks and credentials, etcetera. So I think, certainly, that\u2019s flowing. I think there is still stimulus dollars left. Those tend to take a long time to work their way through the system. I would say, again, the leading indicators for our non-res industry still read positive. Our spec writing activity is quite robust. Our quoting, bidding activity in the channel is still robust. And given the fact that mechanical supply chain has improved, we are back to the book and ship, we are back to made to order there. Sell-through on the channel has been pretty strong. And so I think at least now, we would just still continue to reiterate, we feel good about non-res through 2023. Jeff Sprague : Great. And then not to steal the thunder from next week, but have people walking out of their next week, what \u2013 if they took away one thing from the meeting that maybe they didn\u2019t know or understand about Allegion or was important to accentuate what would that be? John Stone : Yes. I appreciate the prelude to that question, Jeff. It\u2019s good. No, I would say let\u2019s hold the fireworks around the strategy and the technology and all that for now. What I am really excited about is getting all of you over here. You can come in and see what we are doing, see what we are all about and get some more time with this new leadership team. That\u2019s important to us. We just appreciate the chance to spend some time with you and share with you what we are working on. Jeff Sprague : Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question comes from Joe O\u2019Dea with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe O\u2019Dea: Hi. Good morning. John Stone : Good morning Joe. Joe O\u2019Dea: I wanted to start on Americas margin, excluding Access Tech. This looks like, I think maybe the strongest first quarter ever and seems like a faster recovery in those margins than you anticipated earlier this year. So, could you talk a little bit about the factors that contributed to that this quarter? And I think then moving forward, anything unusual about the quarter that wouldn\u2019t persist as we continue to move through the year? Mike Wagnes : Yes. Joe, if you look at the first quarter, we had an extremely strong non-residential revenue quarter. As you know, that is our strongest margin business. So, we had positive mix there and a very elevated revenue number versus what we were in the previous Q1. So, we had both combinations working in our favor. As we move through the year, the one item I do want to highlight, we are ramping up that new manufacturing facility in Mexico. Q1 doesn\u2019t have any real cost there. But as we move through the year, there is investment in start-up costs that are going to be a headwind to margin rate that\u2019s in the assumed guide. And obviously, we are going to be conservative when you think about start-up costs of the new plant so that we are adequately prudent in that guidance. But in general, I would say the factors that drive margin expansion, the productivity that is accelerating from what it was last year, the pricing actions which we feel good about, I think the activity we are driving is sustainable and should be a long-term margin expansion driver for the business. Joe O\u2019Dea: And maybe just a clarifying point on that, I think given seasonality, the first quarter margin tends to be one of the lower of the year, but given the sort of Mexico factory considerations, is it still reasonable to think about just kind of volume seasonality where we would see margins improve or are those costs such that we wouldn\u2019t? Mike Wagnes : Yes. I would say if you think about the margin percentage in Q1, historically, less. However, if you look at that dollar amount of revenue for commercial, you would not have the same size of margin uplift delta versus Q1 than maybe historically you have seen. And then the investments \u2013 think of the investment for the plant, you could see 10 basis points, 20 basis points full year impact from that level of investment. John Stone : Yes. I would add, I think looking at Allegion\u2019s historic seasonality, both for volumes and then obviously resulting margins and operating leverage and whatnot, given how the supply chain disruptions of late \u201821, early \u201822, somewhat moved sales volume from one quarter to the next. I think we have got to be a little bit careful on applying just direct historic seasonality. But that being said, we feel confident in the guide and feel confident that we are in a position to continue to expand margins, like Mike said, 50 bps to 100 bps, and continue to do that in future years as well. Mike Wagnes : And Joe, just to clarify that number for the plant, that would be closer to 20 basis points. Joe O\u2019Dea: Got it. And then, John, maybe on your point, just as we think about sort of backlog that you have to burn and you have supply chain improving, but on top of it sounds like sort of underlying demand conditions remain pretty healthy. And so how do we sort of combine all those factors as we do think about seasonality and we would think that as you go into the middle of the year, you do improve, given what should be a pretty solid backlog in this underlying demand? But I just want to make sure that you think about those factors all correctly. John Stone : Yes. I think that\u2019s why we took the organic growth guide up, the total growth guide up, EPS guide up that we do feel like we got off to a really good start. We do feel that non-res demand is robust. And I think again, quarter-to-quarter looks different just because of the comps last year. But full year, we feel good about the guidance. Joe O\u2019Dea: Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. David MacGregor : Yes. Good morning everyone. Congratulations on the results. Great quarter. John Stone : Thanks David. David MacGregor : I wanted to ask about pricing in the non-res business and specifically in your spec writing business because this is a business that at least as I understand it doesn\u2019t rely as much on MSRP as much as it\u2019s a negotiated price. And obviously, very strong price realization there. Is it just a more competitively rational space right now and that\u2019s really facilitating the price realization, or maybe just talk about what you are seeing competitively in that spec writing space? Mike Wagnes : Yes. David, if you think about the non-res business, new construction tends to be quoted work where it is bid. Historically, it is an industry where everyone competes on value or the market leaders, I should say, compete on value, not price. And so as there is inflation, market participants drive pricing actions to cover inflationary pressures. And since there is a higher inflationary pressure, we are able to get more pricing. But the key takeaway on this industry is everyone competes on value. It\u2019s not a race to the bottom on pricing in the non-residential business. It tends to be a very complex configured offering and that allows everyone to compete on the value of their portfolio. David MacGregor : Yes. I mean I think that\u2019s always been the case. It just seems like right now, it\u2019s a more rational space and maybe your \u2013 there is just enough business to go around that everybody doesn\u2019t have to compete whereas hard. But I don\u2019t know if you can comment on that or not. Mike Wagnes : I would just say for us, and our perspective, I don\u2019t want to talk about anyone else. It\u2019s the inflationary pressures that we felt the last 2 years and the pricing is catching up to some of those pressures. And so you really have to look at it over the last few years, and we have been able to mitigate some of those pricing \u2013 I am sorry, the inflationary pressures that we felt end of \u201821, \u201822 and into early \u201823. David MacGregor : Okay. Great. Second question, just on the distribution channel. In terms of sort of the commercial two-step distributors, are they restocking at this point? Was that a contributing dynamic this quarter? John Stone : Yes. We do field visits all the time. And I think \u2013 again, let\u2019s divide this a bit between electronic products and mechanical products. So, on mechanical products, most of our lead times would be back to a normal level, which puts us in our distribution channel and kind of a made-to-order book and ship type model. And so destocking, restocking is not really a dynamic we see in the majority of the channel. In some of the two-steps, some of the large wholesalers, perhaps. But I think the evidence that we have seen and the anecdotal evidence, at least is demand is pretty robust, sell-through is pretty rapid. And again, as lead times normalize, ordering behavior adjusts and adapts back to that more normal lead time. There are \u2013 some of our electronic products, our commercial electronic products, like we said, still elevated lead times, elevated backlogs and that we are just working hard with the supply base and our redesigns and new suppliers are coming onboard just to catch up to demand and get that part of the business back into this book and ship normal lead time space. We are just \u2013 we are not quite there yet. David MacGregor : Thanks very much. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Ruttenbur with Imperial Capital. Please go ahead. Brian Ruttenbur : Yes. Thank you very much. Let me talk a little bit about pricing plans for the rest of the year and what you have built into your guidance. It sounds like there is less pricing increases, trying to read the tea leaves here, in the second half of 2023 in your guidance. Is that correct? Mike Wagnes : We would always announce a price increase to the channel before we would on an earnings call. I would just say, if you look at our pricing and you try to model it for the back half of the year, you got to just take a look at how much price started to accelerate Q2, Q3 and Q4 last year, which is driving some of the reduction in the overall realization. But it\u2019s important to note, you are still selling the product at the same price. So, it\u2019s not like you are selling it for less dollar value, it\u2019s just the incremental realization percentage will decline versus a more challenging comparable. Brian Ruttenbur : Okay. Thank you. And then my next question is about Q2. I know you don\u2019t normally comment specifically on a quarter, but maybe you can give us a bigger than a breadbox, smaller than a tractor trailer kind of guidance in the second quarter. In terms of versus Q1, should we be seeing revenues and gross margins at relatively similar levels to Q1 and Q2? Mike Wagnes : Yes. I would really not \u2013 don\u2019t really want to give specifics on a quarter per se, but a full year. The only thing I would say is, Q1 obviously a little higher than historically we would do in the first quarter. But I wouldn\u2019t anticipate, don\u2019t model something where the summer season is significantly less than Q1. We still have summers that tend to be pretty strong. Brian Ruttenbur : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to John Stone, President and CEO for any closing remarks. John Stone : Okay. Well, thanks everyone for joining. Thank you for your questions. And again, I would like to reiterate our invitation to all of you for next week\u2019s Investor and Analyst Day. I hope to see you all here in person, both for our management presentations and the tour through the tech center, very excited about that. And just to summarize, continue to see strength in Americas non-res and global electronic solutions. Very pleased, very happy with the Access Technologies acquisition and how that\u2019s starting to perform, very happy and remain committed about our margin expansion, and we will continue that into the future, improvements in cash flow. And just overall, I am really proud of the entire Allegion team and our distribution partners to get us off to such a great start in 2023. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Jobi Coyle, Director of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead. Jobi Coyle : Thank you, [Joe]. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Allegion's second quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are John Stone, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Wagnes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion.

Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details. Please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to John. John Stone : Thanks, Jobi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. My, how time flies. It's hard to believe this time last year, I was joining you for my first Allegion earnings call. I shared then my belief in our company's mission, our people, our culture, and my excitement around this chapter that we're writing in Allegion's history together. One year in, I'm even more energized about Allegion's future and even more proud of our global team who has just delivered another quarter of outstanding operational performance. Let's go to Slide 3 and talk about some of the highlights. The Allegion team delivered 18% total growth and we drove strong margin expansion. In Q2, we increased margins across the Americas and international business segments, both sequentially and year-over-year, resulting in a 130 basis-point increase in adjusted operating income margin for the quarter. We see electronics continuing to be a key growth driver for Allegion. Demand was strong for our electronic solutions in the second quarter, fueling Allegion's overall revenue growth. In Q2, strength across both residential and nonresidential business in our Americas segment totaled nearly 40% electronics growth over the prior period. We also saw a strong electronics and software solutions performance in our international segment. As we work to shape the transformation taking place in our industry, we continue to see electronics as key to our overall growth. Our nonresidential markets remained stable and electronics demand continues to be a bright spot in both Americas and international segments. However, we did see some softness in nonresidential and mechanical demand as customers and distribution partners adjust their ordering patterns to our reduced lead times due to much-improved supply chain and operational execution. The Americas residential business was bolstered by very strong electronics sales, but we're still seeing soft mechanical demand. Certain international end markets, particularly in the portable security business, also remained soft. Overall, our team delivered another strong quarter, resulting in a solid first half 2023. We are operating at a high level, and as a result, are raising our outlook for the year for adjusted EPS, which is now expected to be in a range of $6.70 to $6.80. I'm very proud of the Allegion team's operational performance. I'll provide more color on the outlook later in the presentation. Please go to Slide 4. Now let's move to our vision and strategy. This is a slide we talked through at our Investor Day and while it's a simple overview, it reflects an important foundation for our company. Our vision of enabling seamless access in a safer world. What does that mean? It means if you have the right credentials, whether that's a metal key, an encrypted proximity card, or a digital identity in a mobile wallet, we will provide you the most convenient and secure experience possible. Why is this the right strategy and why is this the right strategy now? Because our world is increasingly digital, mobile, and connected. Because touchless and contactless experiences in technology will clearly live well beyond COVID. Because digital credentials and smart hardware not only provide more seamless access experiences, they also provide more rich data to the end user customer and added layers of security. We feel this transformation has a long runway ahead. Our vision is supported by our strategy of creating value as a pure-play provider of security and access solutions. This is how we differentiate our company and drive innovation for a safer world forward. Building on our legacy, delivering new value and access, being the partner of choice, and operating with excellence. Please go to Slide 5. So, this month also reflects the first anniversary of the Stanley Access Technologies acquisition. Acquiring the Access Technologies business was a direct reflection of our seamless access strategy, making the world more accessible, expanding our presence in access and security markets and unlocking greater long-term value for our customers, our shareholders, and our employees alike. In year one, our teams have integrated very well together. We've taken very good care of our customers, and you can see this in our results, which reflects operational performance in line with the business plan. Access Technologies generated revenues of approximately $385 million, which represented approximately 10% growth. This was $0.11 accretive to adjusted EPS release in its first 12 months. In addition, when we made this acquisition, which is our largest to date, we committed to deleveraging quickly. You can see the results. Our leverage ratios are back to pre-acquisition levels. Overall, we feel great about this highly strategic combination. The automatic doors product portfolio is a hand-in-glove fit with our demand creation and specification engine. This acquisition has greatly enhanced Allegion's service capabilities and we look forward to much more long-term profitable growth opportunities together. I'll ask Mike now to walk you through second quarter financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our updated 2023 outlook. Mike Wagnes : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to Slide Number 6. Allegion delivered another strong quarter, with both top- and bottom-line growth as well as improving cash flows. Revenue for the second quarter was $912.5 million, an increase of 18% compared to 2022. Organic growth of 5.6% was driven by price realization along with strong growth in electronics, offsetting lower volumes in mechanical products. Our Access Technologies acquisition contributed approximately 12% to total growth. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin in the second quarter increased by 130 basis points and 110 basis points, respectively. These increases were attributable to strong operational execution and favorable price and productivity, which more than offset inflation and investments. Excluding our acquisition of Access Technologies, adjusted operating margin was up 270 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.76, increased $0.33, or approximately 23%, versus the prior year. Operational performance drove 20% earnings per share growth with additional earnings per share growth coming from acquisitions, offset by the unfavorable impact of anticipated higher interest. Details of our earnings per share performance versus the prior year are in the appendix. Year-to-date available cash flow was $190.1 million, up nearly 125% versus last year. Please go to Slide Number 7. I will start by reviewing the revenue results for the enterprise here before turning to our respective regions. In Q2, we delivered 5.6% organic growth, driven by price realization across the portfolio. Strong volume growth in electronics was more than offset by volume declines in our mechanical products. Our Access Technologies acquisition served as the primary driver of our 12.5% growth in net acquisitions and divestitures. Currency pressure were minimal in the quarter, bringing total reported growth to 18%. First half organic revenue growth was 10.2% overall, driven by strength in electronics. Americas operating growth was nearly 15% and international was down 3%. Please go to Slide Number 8. Our Americas segment continued to deliver strong operating results in the second quarter, with revenues of $727.2 million, up 23.8% on a reported basis and up 7.7% organically. During the second quarter, we achieved double-digit price realization. Our electronics growth for the Americas was nearly 40% as we continue to see both improvements in our supply chain and strong demand. Electronic component availability was significantly challenged in the first half of 2022, making the quarter an easier comparison versus the prior year as our supply chains are much healthier now. In the second quarter, we saw soft mechanical volumes as customers adjust to our reduce lead times to our improve supply chain and operational execution. Organic growth was up high-single-digits for both our nonresidential and residential Americas businesses. As John mentioned earlier, Access Technologies has now been part of Allegion for just over a year, and we are pleased with the ongoing integration and results. This business had pro forma revenue growth of approximately 9.5% versus Q2 2022, and contributed over 16% to the Americas reported growth. Our adjusted operating income of $205.9 million increased 32.9% versus the prior year period, while adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter were up 190 basis points and 180 basis points, respectively. Excluding Access Technologies, our Americas segment drove a 460 basis-point improvement in operating margin versus the prior year. Our team is executing well and we were able to drive price and productivity in excess of inflation and investments to deliver the strong margin expansion. Please go to Slide Number 9. Our international business had a solid second quarter, with revenues of $185.3 million, flat on a reported basis and down 1% organically. In the quarter, price realization was more than offset by lower volumes, primarily associated with our Global Portable Securities business. As we've discussed previously, this business benefited from a COVID-related demand surge in the first half of last year. We expect this market will normalize and be less of a headwind to our international segment in the second half of this year. Our electronics and software solutions are performing well and continued to be a growth driver for our international segment. In addition, currency was a slight tailwind this quarter and positively impacted reported revenue by 0.6%. International adjusted operating income of $20.9 million increased 2% versus the prior-year period. We saw a significant improvement in adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margins of 30 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively, when compared to last year. The margin improvement was primarily driven by favorable price and productivity in excess of inflation and investment, reflecting strong execution by the team. Please go to Slide Number 10. Year-to-date available cash flow came in at $190.1 million, up $105.6 million versus the prior year. This increase is driven by higher earnings and lower cash used for net working capital, primarily offset by higher capital expenditures. Working capital as a percent of revenue increased versus the prior year, partially driven by our Access Technologies business, which was not owned in the first half of last year. Working capital management remains a priority of our company as we efficiently turn earnings to cash. As committed, we deleveraged following the acquisition of Access Technologies, and our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is back down to 2.1 times. We repaid $60 million on our revolving credit facility in the second quarter and the remaining $30 million outstanding was repaid in the month of July. This means, we have completed our repayments of short-term borrowings for the acquisition, demonstrating our ability to effectively deploy capital and maintain an investment-grade credit rating. Our business continues to generate strong cash flow and our balance sheet continues to be in a healthy position. I will now hand it back over to John for an update on our full-year 2023 outlook. John Stone : Thanks, Mike. Please go to Slide 11. And as we look at the remainder of 2023, we're tightening our full-year revenue outlook, while also increasing our earnings per share outlook. We now expect the Americas segment to be between 15% to 16% for total growth and 7.5% to 8.5% organically. Within the Americas, we expect to see nonresidential organic growth up high-single to low-double-digits. We expect the residential business to be relatively flat as electronics growth is expected to offset mechanical weakness in that segment. As a reminder, our supply chain challenges in our Americas business began to recover in the second half of last year. So, we'll have a tougher, comparable period in the second half of 2023. Additionally, due to our improved lead times this year and their impact on our nonresidential customers' ordering patterns, seasonality is expected to be somewhat flatter than what Allegion's history would imply. For international, we expect revenue to be down 1% to flat in total and down 1% to 2% organically. The comparison for the international business is somewhat easier in the second half of 2023 as weaker market conditions really started to set in during the second half of last year. All in, for the company, our growth outlook reflects total revenue growth to be between 11.5% to 12.5%, with organic revenue growth of 5.5% to 6.5%. As a result of our team's strong operational execution and favorable first half margin performance, we're raising our adjusted EPS outlook for the year and believe it will be between $6.70 and $6.80, which is approximately 12% to 13.5% over the prior-year period. And as you heard from Mike, this is primarily driven by operations execution. Lastly, we're increasing our outlook on available cash flow for 2023 to be in the $500 million to $520 million range. Please go to Slide 12. So, in summary, Allegion delivered a solid first half of 2023. And like we said at Investor Day, we've returned to a high operating level. Our teams are executing very well. Also at Investor Day, we laid out the Allegion operating model that I'd like to go back and revisit a little bit, about driving organic growth, compounding that organic growth with both margin expansion and capital deployment, resulting in double-digit EPS growth. And I feel we're well on track to deliver all of that for 2023. Our end markets are stable, demand is steady, electronics will continue to fuel our overall revenue growth as we stay focused on our vision of enabling seamless access in a safer world. I'm confident in our outlook and very proud of what our team and our distribution partners delivered this quarter and in my first year with Allegion. So, with that, we can open up the Q&A. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just a first question to try and understand the organic sales guidance development first off. So, you raised the guidance in late April on organic sales and you've taken it down a little bit today. So, was it that you saw channel partners and customers suddenly start to destock sort of late in the second quarter? Maybe help us understand sort of what the process was behind that that guidance we vision. And then also on the nonresidential market, specifically, it seems that the macro drivers in the Americas are still very good. So, perhaps a little bit puzzled that you're not seeing new orders coming in to sort of offset the destocking that seems to be happening in some areas. Mike Wagnes : Yes, Julian. If you think about the guide, the last few years, we really struggled with lead times and we got considerably better the end of last year. Our channel partners were maybe a little late to adjust to our reduced lead times. So, what we saw in the second quarter is they're starting to adjust that ordering pattern to our reduced lead times. Especially on the mechanical side, they're back down to normal and were, let's say, at March 31. It took a little longer for them to adjust their ordering. So, they're burning through some of the work that they previously ordered. As you know, we're mostly a made-to-order business, but channel partners will order based on what they think manufacturers can provide product at. And so, we did have some of that choppiness in the second quarter that you saw. When you think about the business in general, I talked about this at Investor Day, expect for us to be total company roughly 50-50 first half to back half. And as you look at our guide right now, you would say it's roughly 50-50 as a company. So, I do think in the second quarter, we did see that channel partners are adjusting to our improvement operationally, which is great because we put a lot of effort to get back to operating at a high level. And then second part of your question related to markets, I'll kind of let John answer that. John Stone : Yes. Julian, thanks for the question. And we see some of those same things, and I think when I look -- if you disaggregate Americas non-res a little bit, the institutional segment in particular shows -- continues to flash signals of resilience. Healthcare, education, even airports that probably are still in the benefiting phase from the Infrastructure Bill because airport terminal renewal was one of the funding principle there of that bill. But the institutional segment continues to show good signals, positive signals. And as you know, that's where our business a bit heavily-weighted. Now that being said, are there pockets of weakness, major metro, commercial office? I mean, that's been soft for sure. That's no secret. But we're also late-cycle. We're heavily-weighted towards institutional. That segment seems pretty resilient. So, in general, yes, we feel, again, that our exposure in non-res is quite stable. The end markets are stable there. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. Thank you. And then just my follow-up, just to make sure we sort of calibrated properly within the second half. Clearly, seasonality is abnormal this year. Your revenues were down sequentially in Q2, which is unusual. And you talked in the prepared remarks about flatter seasonality this year. So, should we assume that you have a much narrower sort of variability between the third and fourth quarter earnings as we look at that, and maybe sort of sales and margins also not that different across the two? Mike Wagnes : Yes. Thanks for the question, Julian. Historically, you know us, we are -- we don't guide quarters. But if you think about our business, usually we have a step-down in Q4 versus Q3 in the Americas, and it's reverse in international. If you think of the Americas this year, we would expect that to be more flatter than normal. So, the way you're thinking about without giving numbers is correct. You shouldn't see as big a drop-off from Q3 to Q4 when you model this versus, let's say, historical norms. Julian Mitchell : That's great. Thank you. Mike Wagnes : Thanks, Julian. Operator : The next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Please, go ahead. Joe O'Dea: Hi. Good morning. Thanks very much. I guess, in terms of that last point, and as we think about what's going on with channel partners and volume trends and the swing from 1Q to 2Q, as we think about the back half of the year and how you're thinking about channel inventory levels, and given maybe not as much seasonality from 3Q to 4Q, is that based on sort of an expectation that at the end of the third quarter, these channel inventories are sort of roughly normalized, or just any views on timing of when those channel inventories get to a more or less normal state? John Stone : Yes. Joe, I think you would find -- and we find on our channel checks and customer visits, a very wide range of answers there. I think our two-step distribution partners, our wholesalers would have a different answer than some of the more traditional contract hardware distributors. And our integrated hardware distributors might have a different answer. I think, in aggregate, we still hear comments like aftermarket activity is very strong, particularly in the non-res space, again, and then the leading macros would say the institutional segment is still pretty resilient. So, we still see, I'd say, good levels of sell-through. And the inventory state of the business is going to be different within the channel. Overall, I think the best way to think about it is you just listen to what Mike said and think first half, second half, 50-50 as kind of the way we see 2023 working out. Joe O'Dea: And then on the Americas margin ex-Access Tech, the 31%, clearly, a really strong margin level. I guess, the -- just sort of framing that relative to some of the comments at the Investor Day and targets to grow margins 50 bps to 100 bps kind of annually, is there anything about the mix that you're seeing or price-cost dynamics that make kind of growing off of this space a little bit more challenging? Just kind of want to understand some of the strength behind that margin in the quarter. Mike Wagnes : Yes. So, Joe, a great question. As you know, obviously, the back half of the year won't have as much margin expansion year-over-year as first half just because the back half of last year was pretty strong. And so, as a result, we still expect to see margin expansion in the back half in total. But it won't be as strong as what you saw in the last two quarters just due to the prior year comp. If you think of last year, we started to really pick up operationally back half. Long-term on Investor Day, I talked about that 50 basis-point to 100 basis-point improvement, that's part of our operating model, and we still believe on a long-term basis, we can deliver margin expansion in those levels. Quarter-to-quarter, it could change by a prior-year comp. But think of the operating model where we're going to drive price and productivity to offset and fund that inflation and investment, drive some expansion with that and the volume leverage. So, in total, the operating model I talked about in length at Investor Day still holds, and we feel good about the progress we've made in our operational execution over the last four quarters. Joe O'Dea: Thank you. John Stone : Thanks. Joe. Operator : The next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please, go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. And John, congrats on the one-year anniversary. John Stone : Thank you, my friend. Joe Ritchie : Yes. So, maybe let's just start on pricing. Obviously, very strong this quarter. Americas was, what, 10%, and you had international pricing that actually accelerated in 2Q. Maybe just tell us a little bit about what's -- what to expect as we progress through the year and whether you're putting additional pricing actions in either region. Mike Wagnes : Yes. Joe, we've talked about this in the past. We fell behind starting in the back half of '21. And we put efforts in to catch up to that inflation dynamic that we struggled with in years past. I feel like we did a pretty good job and have caught up now. The last pricing actions we put in, in our non-res business were earlier this year as we discussed in previous earnings calls. So, as you think about back half pricing, you will see a step-down in the realization percentage, only because the prior-year comp started to accelerate last year. So, if you take a look at last year Q2 to Q3 to Q4, you get an idea of what happened, then you can model the price realization this year on, knowing that the pricing actions have been put in the marketplace. I think it's important to note. We drive pricing actions to kind of recover that inflationary pressures, coupled with productivity and investments. So, that four-item dynamic I've talked about over the last year, that still holds. But you will see a step-down in the realization percentage due to the prior-year comparable. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's helpful, Mike. And my follow-on since you referenced that equation. That price and productivity net of inflation and investments is the strongest, I think, we've seen in really many years. And so, can you maybe just break down a little bit what you're seeing on the productivity versus the investment side? And again, how that's expected the cadence for that going forward through the remainder of the year? Mike Wagnes : Yes, Joe. I really don't want to give individual numbers, but I will say you are seeing an improvement in our productivity and in our efficiency, right? So, as we -- our supply chains normalize, and we operate at a higher level, we are driving a higher level of productivity than what you saw in '22, '21. And so, we're really excited about the momentum we have in productivity. We expect that to continue as an organization. And we do expect to continue to invest in our business to drive that top-line growth, thinking about the great opportunity that electronics and software provides us. So, we'll continue to invest in the business. But what you saw this quarter, you do have better operational efficiency and productivity as that has been a focus for us. John Stone : Absolutely. Joe Ritchie : But that's -- just to be clear, that equation is expected to remain like pretty strongly positive in the back half of the year, correct? Mike Wagnes : Yes. I don't want to forecast or guide that dynamic. Just make sure you get the margin rate right as you look at our EPS guide and revenue. I kind of gave you the pricing as well so you can back into the -- all the dynamics you need for your model. But expect to see margin expansion in the back half. And then as you look at quarters, just be cognizant of our Q3, Q4 comparables of last year as well. Joe Ritchie : Understood. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning, guys. John Stone : Hi, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : So, I just wanted to tease out, if we can, some of the supply versus demand signals on the mechanical side. I think we've heard elsewhere in terms of lead time normalization, some destocking, I guess, those are going to be two separate things with same concept. But any indicators that you're getting from distributors or maybe specifying architects on demand signals or sell-through in June, maybe just to kind of match up that supply versus dynamic -- demand dynamic a bit better? John Stone : Yes. Josh, we'll segment is down a little bit. So, I think when you look at mechanical products broadly, as we indicated in the comments, residential mechanical for us is indeed soft, offset by very strong electronics performance. In the non-res side, I think that dynamic -- again, you can imagine if, for the last eight, nine, 10 months, you're placing your orders and you're not getting delivery for 15, 20 weeks, and then suddenly you're getting delivery and two to four weeks. It takes a little bit to work through that. I think channel checks have anecdotally indicated things to us, like when you look across the Americas, places like the Midwest, South, Southeast, really, really strong. And if you go to some major metro areas that are probably a bit heavy commercial losses, they're pretty light. So, it's pockets of strength and pockets of weakness. On balance, we still see good sell-through. We still see that the non-res market is stable, primarily supported by the institutional segment. Josh Pokrzywinski : Super-helpful. And then just to pick up, some comments that you made, and I guess congrats on the quick de-levering post Access Technologies. I think at the Analyst Day, a lot more focus on growth and inorganic growth was a piece of that. How would you characterize the pipeline right now and what you guys are seeing out there, especially, with now higher interest rates and maybe some less PE competition? John Stone : Yes. I'd say short of talking about any specific targets or anything, I would feel very good about the top of our funnel in terms of looking for acquisition targets. I think, again, think of us as a pure-play provider of security and access solutions. We've talked a lot about the importance of electronics, the importance of controlling software, really driven by the increasing use of smartphone wallets and mobile credentials. That as a macro tailwind really propelling and giving new uses for smart hardware, electronic access control solutions. We feel, again, as an industry, that's still -- all the signals we can find, that's still high-single-digit growth that we can tend to outperform by a point or two and get Allegion's performance in the low-double-digit range. And certainly acquisitions plays a part in that. And I think as we've said now, you can look for us to be acquisitive, you can look and expect us to also be a disciplined buyer. But we do see acquisitions playing a key role in our overall growth strategy. Josh Pokrzywinski : Good color. Thanks. I'll leave it there. John Stone : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please, go ahead. Andrew Obin : Hi, guys. Good morning. John Stone : Hi, good morning, Andrew. Mike Wagnes : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a question on international market volumes. You highlighted portable security weakness, but it seems like underlying volumes got sequentially a little bit better. Can you just -- I know that it's a fairly diverse group of countries, but can you just highlight dynamic maybe by region, Italy, Spain, I don't know, France, Central Europe, Korea, Australia, just any granularity on what's happening there? John Stone : Yes. I'll take a little bit different angle and hope it still answers your question, Andrew. But it's a good... Andrew Obin : Of course. John Stone : Thank you. So, I'd say, the portable security business, without a doubt, volume drag. No doubt about it. As Mike mentioned in the prepared comments, the post-COVID demand spike that you saw in that space was quite dramatic. We do expect that market is going to normalize as you get into 2024 and '25. But I'd say -- and we're not alone and seeing this or commenting on it, but residential in general in Europe is rather weak. And that's by and large a mechanical business. So, those volumes are under pressure. There is no doubt. Our electronics and software solutions would still be probably the low-double to mid-teens organic growth. So, we feel really good there, which is, again, more than the commercial side of our business, the non-res side of our business. APAC for us, we do have some China exposure, it's not a lot, but there's no doubt, China is under a lot of pressure. And so, our relatively small but profitable business there is certainly lower relatively speaking. Australia-New Zealand, pretty steady, pretty stable, kind of falling in line with what you'd see in the Americas, just stable end markets, our teams are performing well there. Andrew Obin : Okay. And just maybe a follow-up question related to institutional. A, if you could sort of differentiate between what's happening hospitals and schools, because it seems that dynamic is somewhat different? And, B, a more interesting question, and you guys turned me onto this years ago, but if you look at muni bond issuance and tax receipts, what's your latest read on the environment going to second half and '24, because I know you guys have an educated view there? Thanks so much. John Stone : You're very kind in your comments, Andrew. I'd say looking at the institutional segment, you don't see quite the amplitude of volatility that you might see in other parts of the commercial business. It's a little bit steadier. It's a little bit more stable. That is the segment that we performed very well in. That's a segment where codes, compliance, safety standards for your building really matter. And that's where Allegion differentiates and I think really excels. Healthcare has been pretty resilient, education has been pretty resilient. And that's both higher ed and K through 12. School safety is always important. Allegion has for a long time been a very proud and vocal advocate for proper standards, proper codes, and compliance. We've increased our human resources, human capital in that space, and continue to be, I think, a very positive participant in the industry for school safety there. When we look at things to the second half, to your question, like muni bonds and state tax revenues, the picture is actually pretty stable, pretty favorable, I'd say. State tax revenues look to be relatively high, like what you saw back in the '08, '09 crash. The environment is a little different this year, maybe some COVID stimulus, maybe just good economic growth, very low unemployment, etc. The tax revenues at the state level seems to be pretty good from the data that we see. Bond issuance in '21 and '22 was very high. And obviously, it has taken a bit of a dip here, but it seems to be sequentially recovering somewhat. Then also remember, Andrew, Allegion is a late-cycle. So, from bond issuance to budget development to projects being firmed up, to shovel in the dirt, so to speak, to finally, door-to-door hardware going on, that can take some time. And so, I think, in general, looking at bond issuance over the long term, drawing a trend line there, you can kind of understand why that segment we see is particularly stable. And so, I'd say, again, flashing signals of resilience in the institutional segment would be the way we see it. Andrew Obin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please, go ahead. Ryan Merkel : Hi, thanks. Two questions from me. Any way to quantify the impact of the order pattern adjustment for mechanical for the full year? And then on electronics, when do you see the lead times normalizing there? And could we see a similar order pattern adjustment at some point there? Thank you. Mike Wagnes : Yes. So, I'll talk about the first one. If you think about our business, Ryan, I keep on talking about that roughly 50-50 first half to back half. We -- so if you think about it for the full-year guide, that will be completed by the end of the year. So, it really won't have an impact on full year. But you could see a flatter quarter-to-quarter variance, like we talked about earlier in the call. So, for a full year, it's really not applicable. But when you think about quarterly timing, it does result in a little more smoothing quarter-to-quarter over the last three than you would normally expect. And then remind me again, your second question? John Stone : Electronics. John Stone : Yes, the electronics, should we expect to see a similar ordering pattern and adjustment in lead times, etc. Lead times have been coming down. I'd say that is the portion of our business where lead times are still a little bit extended, certainly down from the peaks that we saw in the middle of last year, but maybe not yet back to normal, but have been on a pretty good glide path getting back to a more normal, say, four- to six-week kind of lead time for those products. And backlogs are still a little bit elevated there. Demand is still strong. If you see the -- our Investor Day material talking about the non-res mechanical segment being a low-single-digit growth industry, the electronics portion would be high-single-digit growth. So, I think that's the main thing, is we see that as the key growth driver. So, will that same dynamic pop up in the channel? It certainly could. Yet to be seen. And I think as we all get a little bit smarter here and having gone through these quite volatile and dynamic times of the supply chain, maybe with good work, we can we can mitigate it, but yet to be seen. I guess, I don't have a real good detailed forecast for you there. But we'll be watching out for it. Mike Wagnes : Yes. And just add, Ryan, just remember, that electronics, we talked about it extensively at Investor Day, about what a real strong long-term growth driver that is for us. So, demand there, as John mentioned, is still really strong. So, as you think about that business moving forward, that electronics business should be a double-digit growth long-term driver for us. So, this is not a couple of quarters of growth, this is a long-term growth opportunity for us. Ryan Merkel : Got it. Thank you. Mike Wagnes : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please, go ahead. David MacGregor : Yes. So, good morning, everyone. John Stone : Hi, David. David MacGregor : Hi. I just wanted to maybe build off Ryan's question on the electronics. And obviously, a 40% number is a huge number and there's a lot backlog clearance going on there. Can you -- and you talked about kind of the -- Mike, about the high-single-digit growth that's underlying that. Is there any way to sort of trifurcate that down between institutional, commercial, and residential and just give us a better feel for what the second half of this year demand in electronics is likely to look like by sort of that framework? Mike Wagnes : Yes. What you'll see, David, a couple of dynamics in the second quarter. And I talked about it earlier in the prepared remarks. Admittedly, Q2 last year was a little weaker. So, you do have some growth here due to a weaker previous year. But still, this is now four quarters in a row, really strong growth in electronics. We saw strength in both electronics growth in resi as well as non-res. So, both were strong in the quarter. And as we look forward to the end of the year, the back half, we expect to see good growth in electronics. The one thing I'll remind you is the comps in the back half of last year get much tougher, particularly, in electronics, right? So, if you remember last year, we threw some pretty robust numbers up in the back half. So, just make sure you take that into consideration when you model your electronics. But overall, still expect to have some good growth this year and beyond this year in electronics in both res and non-res. David MacGregor : Okay. Thanks for that. And then secondly, just a question on Access Technologies. And I wonder if you could just talk about the extent to which you've been successful building out the recurring service revenues in the first year of ownership? And maybe just also remind us on the scale the international business for AT and your growth with that business over the first year? John Stone : Yes. A really good question, David, and we're always thrilled to talk about Access Technology. There has been a great add to the Allegion portfolio. I'd say the service side of the business has historically been about 40% of the total. It has also historically grown around the low-double-digit rate, high-single, low-double-digit rate. And so, we feel really good about that. We see lots of future opportunities and potential there as our overall, our total Allegion's service capabilities continue to expand and grow. Then, I'd say in terms of international presence with Access Technologies, it's quite small. And so, it's not zero, but it's quite small. This is mainly an Americas business, and where we really focus the investments for new product development and just really staying close to those customer requirements. David MacGregor : Are you focused on putting more feet on the street in building this service offering in that sense, or maybe just talk about how you're investing in that business? John Stone : Yes. So, I think, certainly, it's human capital-intensive business, right? These are very highly qualified, very highly trained, very professional service technicians that go out and do this work. I'd say it's a lot of things. We've got to put better productivity tools in their hands, better diagnostic tools in their hands. We're working on a variety of technology there. And then as we work together with certain channel partners as well, making sure we've got the right coverage and the right people to take care of those customers. So, the human element is important. Absolutely. Technology is also important there. David MacGregor : Are you able to find those people? I mean, are you having -- I'm just wondering how much of a struggle there is to identify and recruit and retain those people. John Stone : Okay. So, three follow-ons. All right. Yes. I'd say, obviously... David MacGregor : You said you'd like to talk about Access Technologies. John Stone : Yes. Don't take advantage of me. Come on. These -- again, these people are hard to find. I won't sugarcoat it. These are very highly skilled, very professional technicians. But we put a lot of investment into training and support as well. And so, we have to be very choosy, because these technicians are the ones keeping our customers up and running. So, it's not just hire as many as you can, it's hire the best. And that's what we focus on doing. Thanks very much for the questions. David MacGregor : Thanks, John. Operator : The next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho America. Please, go ahead. Brett Linzey : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Hi, just a question on electronics versus mechanical. I know, historically, you've said that margin profile is similar. But curious as you get more scale in that category and considering all the redesigns and the reengineering you did last year, is there headroom for the ELOC gross margin to move higher over time? Mike Wagnes : Brett, we think about gross margins for the organization moving higher over time as we drive the price productivity in excess of the inflation and investments and we leverage volume growth. So, I don't think it's just in electronics, I think as an organization, we're going to drive margin expansion. With respect to electronics, I would say there are roughly similar percentages, but with a higher selling price, electronics will give us a little more dollars per every unit of sale. That's a dynamic we've talked about in the past. So, it's great when we can upsell to an electronic device, and it's something we're focused to drive long term. Brett Linzey : Great. And then just on the international side. Clearly, volumes continued to be weak but margin is pretty solid in the quarter on price and productivity. Assuming the volume environment remained soft, do you think Tim and team can defend operating margins in that low-double-digit range? Just curious what the sensitivity might be on the upside to downside. John Stone : Yes. I appreciate the question because we were really proud of what the international team put up in 2Q. Flat revenues, roughly, and still driving margin expansion, to your point. Price productivity net of inflation and investments is a positive dynamic for that group. I'd say, like previous quarters, the Allegion international business is on a much more firm foundation as a business, and we're continuing to find improvement opportunities. So, Tim and the team are performing very, very well. We're proud of what they're accomplishing. And I think we're making good progress against the goals that we've got set out for international. I appreciate you calling that out. Brett Linzey : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Stone, President and CEO, for any closing remarks. John Stone : Thanks very much. And thanks, everyone, for a really great Q&A. And just to really quickly wrap up the main themes you've heard today. Electronics continues to be a strong growth engine for us and we believe we're in the early innings of adoption there within the industry. The driver here is the flexibility and added layers of security that are available when you adopt smart hardware and mobile credentials. Our end markets are stable, and while we saw a softening in volumes this quarter, as customers adjusted to our improved lead times, indication from our channels show steady demand, stable end markets. The Allegion team continues to deliver outstanding operational performance. Our team is controlling the things they can control and they're executing very well, in my opinion. This is marked by strong margin expansion and increased cash flow. With this, we're confident in our performance for the remainder of the year and raising our full-year EPS outlook as a result. Thanks very much. Have a nice day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jobi Coyle, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jobi Coyle : Thank you, Drew. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Allegion's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are John Stone, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Wagnes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we will refer to in today's call are available on our website at investor.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website. Please go to Slide number 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our most recent SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Today's presentation and commentary include non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details. Please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to John. John Stone : Thanks, Jobi, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. This current quarter was all about outstanding operational execution from the entire Allegion team, and I'm pleased with our performance. Electronics demand remains strong with in our opinion a long runway for further adoption. In the quarter, Allegion delivered mid-teens organic growth in electronics and software solutions globally, led by our Americas nonresidential business, which had another robust quarter. We already have the highest margins in our industry, and we're driving additional expansion at the gross and operating margin levels despite not having some of the mechanical volume tailwinds from a year ago. Our balance sheet is getting stronger. We delevered from the Access Technologies acquisition quickly and are now building capital to deploy for growth. Bottom-line, Allegion is poised for a record year in total revenue, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. As a result, we're raising our guidance for full year adjusted EPS. Please go to Slide 4. So Allegion's vision of enabling seamless access in a safer world remains core to our company culture, performance and results. Securing people where they live, learn and work has never been more important. We are a pure-play provider of security and access solutions. We have a great legacy of the strongest brands and the highest margins. We operate with excellence and are accelerating our year-over-year productivity with normalized lead times while still managing the massive SKU complexity that we manage in a made-to-order environment. This makes Allegion a partner of choice, and we're leveraging that unique position to promote the adoption of open ecosystems that maximize our addressable market. We're also delivering new value and access, continuing our drive to wrap software and services around our hardware solutions. This is the critical unlock of additional value for our end user customers for Allegion's growth and for long-term shareholder return. A great proof point of how our company is living this vision and strategy is the Allegion Ventures announcement we made yesterday. Allegion Ventures has made a strategic investment in Ambient AI, whose cutting-edge AI platform utilizes innovative technology to enable seamless access in a safer world. This is the largest investment in Allegion Ventures history, and it reflects the tremendous potential we see in Ambient and Allegion's collaboration to deliver new value and access. Please go to Slide 5. I'd like to turn to our capital allocation priorities. When I joined Allegion, we had just announced the acquisition of Access Technologies. And over the last year, I feel we've done a good job in quickly delevering back to pre-acquisition levels, while still investing in our business and returning cash to our shareholders. Allegion is an investment-grade company, and we expect to remain an investment-grade company. This is critically important to us. We will continue investing for above-market organic growth prioritizing projects and solutions that drive seamless access and make the world safer. We're a dividend-paying stock, and you can expect our dividends to grow commensurate with earnings over the long-term. We will also drive growth through acquisitions, considering complementary portfolios like you saw with the Access Technologies business, as well as Software-as-a-Service related to seamless access, like you saw with plano. High-margin recurring revenue businesses and bolt-on acquisitions that fill portfolio gaps in the hardware space will remain priorities. And while we may increase our debt for the right acquisitions, we've demonstrated the ability to quickly delever. Lastly, with regards to share repurchases at a minimum, we will continue to offset incentive compensation, and we will make additional share repurchases as appropriate. Mike will now walk you through third quarter financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2023 outlook. Mike Wagnes : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to Slide number 6. As John shared, Allegion continued to execute at a high level. We delivered another quarter of solid performance with strong electronics growth, sustained margin expansion and healthy cash flows. Revenue for the third quarter was $917.9 million, an increase of 0.5% compared to 2022. We continue to see favorable price realization along with strength in electronics and access technologies. However, ongoing pressure on our residential business, paired with a challenging prior year comparable, resulted in organic revenue decline of 0.6%. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin in the third quarter both increased by 110 basis points. Price and productivity in excess of inflation and investment along with strong operational execution more than offset the volume decline impact. On a year-to-date basis, we have achieved the highest adjusted operating margin in our history. I'm pleased with the margin performance over the last 18 months as we have now recaptured the margin loss during our supply chain disruptions. Our operating model and strong execution have positioned us well for future margin expansion. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.94 increased $0.21 or approximately 12% versus the prior year. Operational performance drove nearly $0.10 per share with the remaining coming from tax driven by timing of discrete items versus the prior year. We expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 15%. You can find further details of our earnings per share performance in the appendix. Year-to-date available cash flow was $320.4 million, an increase of approximately $95 million versus last year, driven by higher earnings. I will provide more details on our cash flow and balance sheet a little later in the presentation. Please go to Slide number 7. This slide provides an overview of our quarterly and year-to-date revenue. I will review our enterprise results here before turning to our respective regions. As I just mentioned, we have reported growth of 0.5% with a decline in organic revenue of 0.6% in the quarter, as price realization offset pressure on mechanical volumes. As you see on the top of the slide, Q3 is comping against our prior year quarter with organic growth of more than 18%. If you recall that is when our supply chain improvement efforts allowed us to start working through backlogs and past due customer orders and represented the highest organic growth in our company's history. Currency drove some favorability in the quarter, bringing total reported growth to 5/10. On a year-to-date basis, organic revenue was 6.1% overall with Americas at nearly 9%, driven by strength in our nonresidential business. Our international business is down about 3% year-to-date. Please go to Slide number 8. Our Americas segment continues to deliver strong operating results in the third quarter, expanding margins despite lower volumes. Revenues of $740.9 million was down slightly on a reported basis and flat organically, as favorable pricing was offset by reduced volumes. Let me disaggregate the components further. The Americas non-residential business was up low single digits against the prior year comp, which grew approximately 30% driven by backlog reductions I just mentioned. On a year-to-date basis, non-residential business has grown double digits. Our Americas residential business is down low teens in the quarter as we continue to see weakness in the residential market as higher interest rates continue to impact new and existing home sales. Our Access Technologies business delivered organic growth of mid-teens, representing another strong quarter of top-line growth and demonstrating the stability that this business provides us. Demand for our electronic solutions remained strong in the Americas. We delivered high teens organic growth in electronics in the quarter, and we continue to see a long runway for further adoption as electronics remains a key growth driver for the long-term. As we discussed during our second quarter call, mechanical volumes were expected to be a little soft in the third quarter as customers adjusted to our reduced lead times. We feel the channel has worked through this adjustment, and we are back to a more normal book and ship business. Our Americas adjusted operating income of $210.6 million increased 5% versus the prior year period, while adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter were up 140 and 150 basis points, respectively. Pricing and productivity exceeded inflation and investments driving substantial margin expansion, demonstrating the resiliency of our Americas business model. Please go to Slide number 9. Our International segment executed well in a challenging macroeconomic environment. Revenues of $177 million was up 3% on a reported basis and down 2.8% organically. Price realization was more than offset by lower volumes, primarily associated with our global portable securities business and our China business, which are operating in challenging markets. We continue to see strength in our electronics and software solutions, which grew low double digits organically in the quarter. In addition, currency was a tailwind this quarter, positively impacting reported revenues by 5.2%. International adjusted operating income of $23.7 million increased over 18% versus the prior year period. We also saw improvements in adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margins of 180 and 190 basis points, respectively. This substantial margin expansion, despite reduced volumes, highlights the healthier portfolio within our International segment. Please go to Slide number 10. As I mentioned earlier, year-to-date available cash flow came in at $320.4 million, up nearly $95 million versus the prior year. This increase is driven by higher earnings, partially offset by higher capital expenditures related to our new facility in Mexico, which begins production later this quarter. Working capital as a percent of revenue increased versus the prior year. This was primarily driven by timing of revenue and associated receivables within the quarter as well as timing of payments to suppliers in the prior year. Working capital and inventory management remain a priority for our company as we efficiently turn earnings to cash. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA is down to 2x as we continue to successfully delever following the Access Technologies acquisition. We repaid the final $39 million on our revolving credit facility in the quarter, completing our repayments of short-term borrowings associated with that acquisition. We are now back to pre-acquisition leverage levels, which demonstrates our proven track record of effectively deploying capital while maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. Our business continues to generate strong cash flow and our balance sheet continues to be in a healthy position. I'll now hand the call back over to John for an update on our full year 2023 outlook. John Stone : Thanks, Mike. Please go to Slide 11. As I mentioned earlier, our company is on track for record full year revenue, adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS in 2023. We're raising our full year outlook on adjusted EPS and affirming our full year outlook on revenue and available cash flow. We continue to expect the Americas segment to be 15% to 16% for total growth, 7.5% to 8.5% organically, led by our non-residential business, which is still expected to grow high single to low double digits organically. Residential business is expected to be down slightly as markets remain challenged. For international, we continue to expect revenue to be down 1% to flat in total and down 1% to 2% organically. All in for the company, our outlook continues to reflect total revenue growth between 11.5% and 12.5% with organic revenue growth between 5.5% and 6.5%. Based on our strong operational performance in the third quarter, we're increasing our adjusted EPS outlook to the range of $6.80 to $6.90, which is approximately 13.5% to 15% growth over the prior year period. Lastly, we still expect our outlook on available cash flow to be in the range of $500 million to $520 million. I'm very proud of the work of the entire Allegion team and our distribution partners over the course of this year and the record results we're on track to achieve. Looking forward, we'll provide our full 2024 outlook to you during our fourth quarter call, as we normally do. However, given the uncertainty in the market moving into next year, we wanted to give you some insights into our view of the market dynamics today. First, we expect growth in electronics adoption to continue, driven by the convenience and added security that digital identities and mobile credentials leveraging smartphone wallets provide to our end user customers. A shift from mechanical systems to electronic access control systems with connected hardware provides efficiencies and operating cost savings for buildings and campuses, and recent channel checks and recent end user visits in the institutional segments in Education and Health Care reinforce this trend. And while small today, our software solutions portfolio is growing, and we look to accelerate this growth into 2024 and beyond. In addition, while the most recent ABI headline dipped, the institutional segment has been very resilient over the last 12 months and 5 of the last 6 months still reading above 50. Allegion's context is important here. You'll recall that we're a late-cycle business and also rather heavily weighted towards the institutional segment. We have an auto door business with strong backlogs and a blue-chip customer base and a service business that continues to grow. Our channel is in good shape on inventory and our lead times across the portfolio are now normalized. Our supply chain has improved to the point where we can regain market share in the aftermarket space. Expected headwinds are well known at this point. Commercial office in major metro areas is indeed soft. It's been soft for several months now. However, that part of our business is only a low double-digit percent of our overall Americas portfolio. Weakness in residential and certain international market is expected to continue, particularly for mechanical products, which we've highlighted for you throughout this year. We expect productivity and recent cost actions that we have taken to help drive margin expansion into next year. And before we go to Q&A, I'd like to reiterate what I said at the beginning of the call. Allegion is in a good industry, and we're well positioned, thanks to the strong execution by our team. We've navigated industry cycles very well in the past. And with the improvements we've made to our portfolio and operations, we feel confident in our ability to succeed and drive continued organic growth and margin expansion. With that, let's turn to Q&A. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe O'Dea: So John, maybe on that last point, and I'm not sure you're sort of willing to maybe elaborate a little bit more, but just the '24 kind of considerations. I mean it seems like if institutional channel checks are constructive market share gain potential in aftermarket, understandable headwinds on commercial office and resi, but then productivity and cost actions as well. I mean it seems like it's setting up for margin expansion. Is it also today setting up for top-line growth with the mix of those factors? John Stone : Yes, Joe. I appreciate the question. I'd say again, the short answer, yes, we see organic growth in the future. I'd just keep bringing you back to Allegion as a late cycle business. We're heavily weighted towards institutional. If you look at Dodd starts, if you look at ABI, the institutional segment has been very resilient in the last 12 months or even longer. And so yes, we feel pretty good about that, both on driving organic growth as well as, just like you mentioned on the margin expansion side. So margin expansion might not be as robust as you've seen these last quarters, but we still feel well-positioned to continue to drive margin expansion productivity and as you heard and as you called out, the cost actions that we've taken here recently, still well positioned. Joe O'Dea: All right. I appreciate that. And then, also just international and maybe level setting on your views on where things stand within that cycle, where we've got I think now 6 quarters of volume declines. It's been, I think, some time that a lot of that has been on portable security. I think electronics has been holding up quite better. But just where you think you are in that cycle? How close you are maybe to a bottom within the international trends? John Stone : Yes. That's tough to peg, Joe, like whereas is the bottom. For international, our portfolio spans Europe and Asia Pacific. And certainly, I think we see continued weakness in China, even though that's a small part of our portfolio. I'd say continued weakness would not be ready to call a bottom. On the portable security business, it's still a challenged market. There's no doubt about it. Time to call a bottom. We're definitely flirting with the bottom, I would say, which could provide a small bit of tailwind into next year and beyond. But you called out the most important piece, and that's the continued growth around our electronics and software solutions portfolio in Europe. They've been performing extremely well. We're continuing to invest in that business, like the bolt-on acquisition of plano. That team came on board and is performing very well, integrated very well with our Interflex team. And we see a really bright future there. And in the electronic space, yes, continued growth, and we will continue to drive investments to drive that growth. Mike Wagnes : Joe, I might also add, if you think about that global portable, we've been calling that out all year. So it's going to be a soft 2023, all 4 quarters. So if you think about next year, it's not a big headwind, I'm sorry, a big headwind versus the current year because you do have 4 soft quarters. So I think it's important to understand that dynamic about global portable. Operator : The next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just wanted to circle back to the Americas organic sales outlook. So it looks like the fourth quarter implied is organic sales may be up mid-single digits year-on-year in Q4 and then sort of down mid-single digits sequentially. So just wanted to sort of make sure that's roughly correct, and any color within that on non-resi versus resi dynamics. And when we look at that plus mid-single digits entry rate into 2024 and the fact that your guidance from the Investor Day was plus mid-single digit for the Americas market, we assuming that kind of run rate can sustain into early '24? Mike Wagnes : Yes, Julian, if you think about the current year, so much of the current year growth rates are driven by comps in the prior year. So if you think about Q3, we last year really started to ramp our plants up as we got rid of that excess backlog in mechanical. That continued into Q4 last year. So this year, obviously, back half does have lower growth rates than first half. With respect to the two businesses, I think it's fair to say that non-residential certainly is healthier or stronger than the residential end markets. So as I think about a full year, think of non-res, double digits, right? And you can do the math to back into the Q4 implied. That residential, we are going to be down slightly this year as we put in the prepared remarks, which is we\u2019ve been saying relatively that this year, whether it's down slightly or relatively flat all year. So you do have a dynamic where resi is a little weaker, as we've been saying, and the non-res led by institutional is hanging in there. But prior year comps do impact the year-over-year quarterly growth rates. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. Thank you. And it sounds like you're fairly confident that, that inventory destock process by your sort of customers and channel partners is largely done. Maybe just sort of help us understand the conviction level around that. And when you're looking at your sort of forward-looking indicators, I think you mentioned backlog down a bit. But maybe any color on sort of the spec writing for the Americas business overall. How does kind of the order patterns change? Have you seen any evidence of project pushouts, that type of thing? John Stone : Okay. That's about 5 questions in there, Julian. Well done. I'd say on the channel destock, we feel pretty good there. I think our commentary in Q2 kind of indicated we didn't view this as a real long-term issue. And channel checks kind of prove that out. I don't think it's still a big headwind at this point. We've met with our 25 largest distributors in the past few weeks, and then that would confirm that. So again, there's still certain metro areas that are a little bit soft. There are still suburban areas that are quite strong, quite robust aftermarket, et cetera. So overall, feel pretty good along with the comments that Mike just shared. Let's see what else to mention there. I think with respect to the spec activity, spec activities still remain solid, and it's still hanging in there. And so we would expect that institutional heavy business to be driven that's the spec engine that we have to still remain solid as we move forward. So spec activity still remains strong for us. Operator : The next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : So can we maybe just following up on the mechanical business bottoming comment. So your portfolio has gone through some change, obviously, with the Access business, the electronics business growing at a faster pace. If I think about the kind of overall level of where the mechanical business is today, what's the kind of right run rate that should be bottoming, whether that's on a quarterly basis or an annual basis? Just any color around that would be helpful. Mike Wagnes : I'd share this with you, Joe. If you look at our revenue growth, starting in Q3 last year, we started shipping those past due orders serving our customers. That continued, if you recall, Q1 this year, real large growth that we had. So you could think of that as a kind of a 3-quarter burn through that backlog type challenge and the customers adjusting to our new lead times. I think from that point on, we're kind of more normalized. We talked in Q2 about that item. So I feel that that's behind us. It's those 3 quarters where you do have that more challenging comparable on the non-residential mechanical business we talked about. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Great. Appreciate that, Mike. And then maybe my follow-on, John. You talked about the balance sheet getting back into investment grade, good shape. You delevered now to 2 turns. I'm curious, there are some fairly sizable assets that are out there potentially on the security side. As you're thinking about deploying capital, how are you thinking about M&A and particularly like bolt-ons versus maybe some more transformative type deals? John Stone : Yes. Great question, Joe. And I think the teams performed very, very well. Cash flow has improved very well this year. And we did delever quite well, and I think happy with where we're positioned. And again, as in the prepared remarks, building capital to deploy for growth. And I think for us, you can look for us to be acquisitive. You can look for us to look to fill portfolio gaps with bolt-on hardware solutions, like we did with Access Technologies or SaaS businesses like we did with plano. As long as things are the right strategic asset, the right leadership team, a business model, a culture that fits with Allegion and is in the sandbox of security and Access solutions, you can look for us to be acquisitive. Certainly not right to comment on any particular transaction, but we do expect to grow through acquisition and building capital to do just that. Operator : The next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Brett Linzey : Just wanted to dig in on the complexion of the marketplace and really thinking about in the softer commercial pockets versus the institutional resilience. Is there any good way to think about the locker access content per building between those 2 verticals? I think you get multiples of the wallet share in school or a hospital versus a retail front, but any insight there would be helpful. Mike Wagnes : Yes. Brett, when you think of our business, the more complex the business, a building rather, the richer the mix for us. So if you think about a higher edge school, a hospital, those are really good for us. The K-12 school, there's doors frequently and openings frequently per square foot. If you think about open floor plans like commercial office, there's clearly less openings on a commercial office floor plan than there is in an institution or a warehouse, or a warehouse, absolutely. So warehouse has been awful over the last 12 months from a starts, but we really don't have any openings in the warehouse. So when you look at our business, that institutional heavy aspect of our portfolio gives us a richer mix and gives us more openings to address. So that's a net positive for us. John? Brett Linzey : Yes. Got it. And then just shifting back over to residential, down low teens. You will be lapping your first destock comp in the fourth quarter of '23 here. Could you just characterize where you see those categories in their destocking phase? And any visibility you have on the sellout trends within some of those resi channels? John Stone : Yes. So I think resi mechanical, when we see our own results and we see some other industry participant results, it's a tough end market, let's just say. So I don't know that I necessarily attribute it just to destocking, but it's a soft end market with mortgage rates going up. House churn, if you will, or resale is certainly a bit depressed. Permits and starts, maybe if you look through a rose-colored lens, you see some green shoots of hope for the future. But I think that overall market is still depressed. When we think about our comps, I would just come back to there was a period of time in 2022 where we just couldn't ship our electronic locks even in the resi segment. And so the restocking phase was still going on until rather recently. And now you could say it's a more normal point-of-sale-driven business on the e-lock side. The mechanical side, I think it's just end market is depressed. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Please go ahead. Chris Snyder : I wanted to ask on the Americas business into Q4. So if we look at and if my match right, if you kind of look at the Q4 or the full year organic guide, it kind of pegs Q4 revenues in the Americas anywhere from flat sequentially to maybe down 4% sequentially versus Q3. And when we look at all the pre-COVID years, it seemed like Americas was typically down anywhere from 4% to 7% into Q4. So it's calling for better-than-normal seasonality. Can you just maybe talk about what's driving that or is there Access Technologies? Mike Wagnes : No, Chris, if you remember on an organic basis in the summertime, we talked about, hey, we're burn through this channel destock. And we said it will be a little flatter this year than historically. So what you saw, we did get through that in the third quarter, which was what we expected. Now as we just think about Q4, sequentially, we're normally down. We're just not down as much as historically we may have been on a more normalized no channel and order pattern challenges that we had in the current year. So think of it as working through that channel item we discussed in the second quarter call. John Stone : And I think, Chris, this is John. I heard you squeeze in, a mention of Access Technologies in there. And you're right. I mean this is now considered in the organic part of the portfolio. And that business is performing very well. Again, you got strong backlogs, blue-chip customer base and a very healthy service business there. So yes, they've been performing well. Very happy with that acquisition. Chris Snyder : Yes., I saw the organic growth come through this quarter there. I guess maybe if I could follow up. I think you kind of said earlier that when you talk to your channel partners, it sounds like the destock is largely in the rear view, if I heard that right. Like what does that assume for the cycle? Does that assume like the cycle is kind of flattening out? Are we through the destock even if the cycle kind of is going lower from here because it does feel like the amount of inventory in the channel does reflect what the outlook for the cycle is. Thank you. John Stone : Yes. I think the way I would see that is similar to what Mike said. Given the rather dramatic volatility and upheaval that the entire industry experienced with the ramp in inflation and the pretty acute supply chain challenges in the latter half or actually, all of 2022. No parts in the first half to work over time, 6 days a week, et cetera, and over ship in second half. That is, at least in our view, normalizing. And I think you could see, as we progress on to another 2, 3, 4 quarters that cycle, Allegion's seasonality, et cetera, starts to look more normal. Our lead times across the portfolio are back to a more normal level. And so with the 9-month or so construction backlog, a lot of work still out there, book and ship business, like Mike said and a spec engine that's running all the time. Yes, I'd say we feel just normalizing is maybe the word that I would use, Chris. And that's what it starts to feel like. And again, our channel checks recently would indicate the same. Operator : The next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Please go ahead. Tim Wojs : I have a couple of just kind of modeling questions. But I guess when you're thinking about raw material inputs, steel, copper, zinc, that set of things. I mean, what are you seeing in terms of your purchases today? And how do you think about inflation versus deflation on kind of a go-forward basis on the raw side? Mike Wagnes : Yes, Tim. It's a great question. If you think of our business, if you remember, pure raw math, let's call that maybe 15% of our COGS, and the remaining 35% you could get have some element of metal in it from a source component. We would expect to see some favorability, as you've seen. We got some tailwinds in commodity prices versus previous peaks. However, I'd caution you, there's been significant inflation that we've experienced over the last few years in other elements of the cost base so that we're still in an inflationary environment, but you are getting some relief from the previous highs of the commodity costs. So hopefully, that kind of gives you some color for you to factor in. Tim Wojs : Okay. Okay. No, that's helpful. And then just on pricing, if I kind of take a 3 years kind of stacked price in Americas, I think there was some acceleration kind of sequentially. And I don't think you put through like a new increase, but is there some mix dynamic kind of going in there, or did you guys put through more price? Mike Wagnes : Yes, Tim, as you know, we put price increases in over the last 18 months because we felt so much of that inflationary pressure. We manage this equation price plus productivity to cover the inflation and the investments. If you think about pricing moving forward, think of us as a more normal business, which does our annual price increase in the kind of the beginning of the year based on an expected inflationary level. No more of the multiple price increases a year, I think that's behind us because inflation has moderated from the previous significantly elevated levels that you saw a year plus ago. And so just moving forward, just think of us, price plus productivity versus inflation and investment and most importantly, we price for value in the market that we provide our customers. Operator : The next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow. Please go ahead. David MacGregor : Could you just talk a little bit about the mid-teens organic growth in the electronics and the software solutions business. I don't know to what extent you might be able to open that up for us and help us with price versus units or residential versus non-res or Americas versus international, POS versus inventory build. Any sort of granularity around that would be helpful. John Stone : Yes, I think in aggregate, mid-teens organic growth in the electronics and software solutions globally, quite proud of those numbers between new product launches and just good execution by the team. And I'd say the end user demand is still strong. Again, recent end user visits continue to reinforce this. I've been to a couple of large universities lately. And even though they've been on the electronics adoption for a couple of years, they're still just scratching the surface. One university was, hey, I've got -- I haven't even started on the dorms yet. I've just been doing classrooms and event buildings and things like this. And as budget comes next year and putting it straight to e-locks for the dorms, I mean, that's sample size of one, but it's indicative of what we're hearing in the end user base, particularly education and health care. I would say our electronics and software business in Europe is doing very well. Blue-chip customer base, great value prop on the electronic cylinder with the SimonsVoss team. And the plano acquisition adding a bit of inorganic growth into that space as well, and that's a space we'll continue to invest in. Very proudly, it's a tiny amount, but our solution for multifamily in the United States, the Zentra platform, that's a very simple electronic access control platform designed specifically for multifamily applications is now a revenue-generating product for Allegion. So cloud-based SaaS revenue is a reality. It's very small. We're just getting started, but we do expect to accelerate that growth. I think the end-user economic benefits of electronics adoption is important and it's real. And I think the smartphone wallet and this mobile credentials and that convenience and personalized security you get out of that will continue to drive end user demand. That's the main trend, David. I'd encourage you not to get wrapped around the axle about channel build or restock, destock, anything like that. It's really, this is end user demand driven. David MacGregor : Right. Okay. Thanks for that. And as my follow-up, I mean we're looking at a relatively strong U.S. dollar here. I'm just wondering what impact that has on your business by drawing more imported product into the marketplace? Mike Wagnes : David, as you think about imports, they play at the very low end of the marketplace in, let's say, North America, if you think of our non-res business, we tend to be really strong in the premium space with our institutional heavy business. We've been talking about this for years. We tend to be strongest when the customer values that premium offering of complexity and solutions that we provide. So a strong dollar or a weaker dollar is not something that we view as really going to be changing the dynamics of our competitive industry. John Stone : Yes. I would add just 1 comment there, David. Some of our flagship products, like the Von Duprin, exit devices like the [indiscernible], I mean, these are very proudly manufactured in the United States. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Congratulations on a strong quarter. So a question on Europe and sort of the margins in Europe. Can you just give us a sense of what Interflex has been doing because I know it's one of the higher profitability business. I was just trying to understand how much the mix is at play here? Or if it's not Interflex, just as I said, the performance in Europe has continued to surprise despite the headwinds from the sort of the backlog business, just sort of more insight as to what's driving the structural improvement in margins now? John Stone : Yes, Andrew. I really appreciate that question because I am just super proud of how the international team has been on this steady march of building momentum, increasing productivity, expanding margins without a volume tailwind giving them operating leverage to lean on. They've been doing extremely well. I would say the Interflex in particular, we're not going to call out a specific margin or a P&L for them, but that's a very strong business, let's just say. And we talk about them together with the other electronics portfolio in Europe, double-digit growth for us and has been for a while. Strong margin performance as well. And I think we put our money where our mouth is with the plano acquisition. And while that was rather small, the growth potential is quite large, the margin is very attractive, and the customer value delivered there between plano and Interflex together is very compelling. And Interflex is another one of those very special businesses. Like in this call, we mentioned Access Technologies has a blue-chip customer base. Interflex really has a blue-chip customer base. And we take pride in delighting those customers with good solutions and good service, and that business continues to grow very positive for us. Andrew Obin : Excellent. And just maybe a follow-up question. I think your predecessor, when he started used to talk quite a bit about discretionary retrofit market in North America being a source of outgrowth and then we sort of stopped talking about it. Can we just talk about where we are there? And what's the remaining opportunity for continuing to increase your market share there? Have you taken a closer look at it? Just maybe an update on this business because it used to be a big source of our growth. John Stone : Yes, Andrew, it's a hugely important point. When the supply chain challenges hit and orders started piling up and backlog started piling up, we were in the business of just shipping everything we could to make up for orders that had been in the queue for a long while. And then, obviously, aftermarket work is going to take a backseat to whatever, 3, 4 months' worth of backlog that's just sitting there in orders that you've already got to fill for project business and other things. So I would say I'd feel like when the supply chain challenges were at their worst, we definitely lost some aftermarket share to competitors that Allegion typically doesn't and shouldn't lose share to. We're now in a position with our lead times, our published lead times back to normal. Our delivery performance improving. Our supply chain performance is vastly better. We're in a position to now compete and gain that share back, and I think that's a real opportunity for us that has been a long time coming. But getting the lead times back to where they ought to be, getting the delivery performance up and getting our internal productivity better now puts us in a better position to get out and win more of that business. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Stone, Chief Executive Officer, for any closing remarks. John Stone : Well, thanks, everyone, for a great Q&A. And just to wrap up the main themes that I hope you heard today. Allegion continues to operate at a high level. Strong execution drove these Q3 results that include mid-teens organic growth in electronics and software solutions, continued margin expansion and a healthy balance sheet and cash flow, giving us good momentum going into next year. We're on track for a record year of revenue, adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS results in 2023. We will continue to drive organic growth and margin expansion, as we mentioned. In both the short term and the long term, I feel we're very well positioned to both build on our legacy and continue to invent and deliver new value and seamless access. Thank you. Be safe, be healthy. Have a great day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Josh Pokrzywinski, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Thank you, Drew. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Allegion's fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. With me today are John Stone, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Wagnes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion.

Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details. Please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to John. John Stone : Thanks, Josh. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'd like to start today by recognizing that 2023 was a year of strong execution by the entire Allegion team. This performance reflects the value we add for our customers, the strength of our distribution partners, as well as the quality of our brands and the capabilities and expertise of our employees. Let's walk through some highlights of the quarter and the year. After celebrating our 10th anniversary as a standalone company in December, we closed the year with record revenue, adjusted operating income, and adjusted EPS. Reinforcing the thesis behind our seamless access strategy, electronics demand remained strong. We delivered approximately 20% organic growth in electronics for the year as supply chains normalized, and that's on top of mid-teens organic growth in the prior year. We sustained a high operating cadence and expanded our industry leading margins in the quarter. And for the full year, our adjusted operating margin performance was 22.1%, up 160 basis points. Simply stated, the Allegion team delivered on price and productivity, bringing margins back to pre-pandemic levels, with room to expand further in 2024 and beyond. Our balance sheet and cash flow generation are strong. We ended the year under 2 times net debt to EBITDA, which sets up a 2024 return to the balanced capital deployment you've come to expect from Allegion. When you look at our past decade, this team has delivered solid results and executed well through a variety of macroeconomic backdrops. We've built on the strength of 100 year old brands, consistently meeting customer needs and meeting our commitments to shareholders. We've operated with excellence, sustained the highest margins in the industry, and are still pioneering safety, better securing people and their property where they live, learn, work, and connect. Driven by our vision of enabling seamless access and a safer world, we're proud of this track record, we're proud of what we delivered in 2023, and we're excited about the momentum we're carrying into 2024. Please go to Slide 4, and let's talk about our capital allocation strategy in action. Reflecting on Allegion's first 10 years, we've had a roughly even split between inorganic growth and the return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We remain committed to balanced, consistent capital allocation, and having quickly delevered from the Access Technologies acquisition, our balance sheet supports this strategy. As we move into 2024, we will continue investing for organic growth, prioritizing projects and solution that drive seamless access forward. One recent example in new product development is Schlage's next generation of innovative electronic locks, the XE360. This is the latest wireless lock family from Schlage, designed with flexibility and interoperability in mind. With solutions for perimeter and interior doors, this series has the security and access features most looked for by multifamily and light commercial properties at attractive price points. It leads with open architecture, supports the latest credentialed technologies, and integrates with the Allegion and our partner systems. In addition, Schlage's innovative FleX Module allows the XE360 series to be easily upgraded in the field to allow migration from an offline to a network solution and to adapt to emerging trends in security and connectivity down the road. Next, Allegion will continue to be a dividend-paying stock. You can expect our dividends to grow commensurate with earnings over the long term, and we've just announced our 10th consecutive annual increase. We also expect to grow through acquisitions. Bolt-on acquisitions that fill portfolio gaps in the hardware space and high margin, recurring revenue business in the access solutions space will remain priorities. Larger deals like Access Technologies may be more episodic, but we will be disciplined and have demonstrated the ability to quickly delever. Boss Door Controls, which we closed this month, is a classic bolt-on that both complements and expands how we go-to-market in the UK. This acquisition bolsters our local business with a strong architectural channel, flexible supply chain, and also positions us to increase our spec-driven business there in the future. Lastly, with regards to share repurchases, as we've said, at a minimum, we will continue to offset incentive compensation. And as you saw in the fourth quarter, we will make additional share repurchases as appropriate. Mike will now walk you through fourth quarter financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2024 outlook. Mike Wagnes : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to Slide number 5. As John shared, Allegion continued to execute at a high level and delivered another solid quarter. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $897.4 million, an increase of 4.2% compared to 2022. Organic growth of 2.6% was driven by our Americas non-residential and Access Technologies businesses, offset by declines in residential and international. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 130 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively, in the fourth quarter, driven by price and productivity in excess of inflation and investment. I am pleased with the margin performance as we have recaptured the margin loss during the supply chain disruptions experienced in late 2021 and early 2022. Our operating model and strong execution have positioned us well for future margin expansion. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.68 decreased $0.01, or approximately 0.6% versus the prior year. Operational performance drove growth of $0.17 per share, with the offset coming from tax, driven by the timing of discrete items versus the prior year. John will cover the outlook later in the presentation, however, I want to note that our tax rate will migrate to between 18% and 19% in 2024, inclusive of the implementation of global minimum tax. We expect Allegion's structural tax rate will be in the high-teens over the planning horizon we laid out at our Investor Day in May. Finally, full year available cash flow for 2023 was $516.4 million, a 30.6% increase versus last year, driven by higher earnings and improved working capital performance. I will provide more details on cash flow and balance sheet a little later in the presentation. Please go to Slide number 6. This slide provides an overview of our quarterly and full year revenue. I will review our enterprise results here before turning to our respective regions. Organic growth in the quarter was 2.6%, a strong price realization offset pressure on volumes. Currency and acquisitions drove additional favorability in the quarter, bringing the total reported growth to 4.2%. On a full year basis, organic revenue growth was 5.2% overall, with Americas at 7.4%. Our international business was down 2.5% for the year. Our full year organic growth was led by our electronics and software solutions, which grew globally by approximately 20% in 2023, with both regions in double-digits. Please go to Slide number 7. Our Americas segment continues to deliver strong operating results in the fourth quarter. Revenue of $704.6 million was up 3.7% on both a reported and organic basis as favorable pricing offset lower volumes. Our Americas non-residential business was up mid-single digits against a prior-year comp that grew in the mid-20%\u2019s. On a full year basis, this business had double-digit organic growth in 2023. Residential markets are soft, with our business down low-single digits in the quarter and for the full year, as higher interest rates continue to impact new and existing home sales. Our Access Technologies business delivered organic growth of mid-single digits in Q4. Americas electronics growth remained strong on a multi-year basis, with mid-single digit growth in the quarter on top of the nearly 50% comparison in Q4 2022. Our Americas adjusted operating income of $188.4 million increased 10.8% versus the prior year period, while adjusted operating margins and adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter were up 170 basis points and 190 basis points, respectively. The team executed well. We are performing more efficiently, driving price and productivity, and we delivered margin expansion every quarter in 2023. Please go to Slide 8. Our International segment continues to execute well in a challenging macroeconomic environment. Revenue of $192.8 million was up 5.9% on a reported basis and down 1.3% organically. Price realization was more than offset by lower volumes associated with soft end market demand. Currency and acquisitions were a tailwind this quarter, positively impacted reported revenues by 4.4% and 2.8%, respectively. International adjusted operating income of $32.3 million increased nearly 13% versus the prior year period. We also saw improvement in adjusted operating margins and adjusted EBITDA margins of 110 basis points and 100 basis points, respectively. The team delivered margin expansion for Q4 and the full year despite a challenging topline, highlighting the healthier, more resilient business portfolio we have within our International segment. The acquisition growth I mentioned earlier is primarily driven by our plano business, a tuck-in software-as-a-service business we acquired early 2023, which is accretive to both growth rates and margins. Please go to Slide number 9. As I mentioned earlier, year-to-date available cash flow came in at $516.4 million, up nearly $121 million versus the prior year. This increase is driven by higher earnings and working capital improvements, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. You can look for Allegion to continue to invest in our business and convert earnings to cash. Next, working capital as a percent of revenue improved versus the prior year, driven by higher inventory turns as supply chains normalized. Finally, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA is down to 1.9 times as we successfully delevered following the Access Technologies acquisition. We are now back to historical leverage levels, which demonstrates our proven track record of effectively deploying capital, while maintaining both our leverage profile and our investment grade credit rating. Our business continues to generate strong cash flow and our balance sheet continues to be in a healthy position. I will now hand the call back over to John for our 2024 Outlook. John Stone : Thanks, Mike. Please go to Slide 10. And before we get to guidance, I want to spend a moment on what we see as a couple of key drivers for 2024, including macroeconomic inputs that inform our outlook. We're expecting more modest inflation in 2024, enabling normal levels of margin expansion from net price and productivity. We report these to you as aggregate price, productivity, inflation, and investments shown in the left-hand chart. Since the beginning of 2019, we've averaged approximately 60 basis points of margin contribution annually from net price and productivity. This has been a hallmark of the business over time and it's a key driver of our 2024 outlook. We're expecting a stable non-residential environment, underpinned by healthy institutional markets. You can see Dodge starts for institutional have shown steady growth in the past few years, contrasting the higher volatility in commercial leaning verticals. As you all know, Allegion is a late-cycle business, and starts can lead our business by a year or more. We're not expecting many market tailwinds, however, we believe the visibility and stability of late-cycle institutional verticals, as well as our large installed base, will allow us to deliver organic growth. Please go to Slide 11, and let's walk through the outlook for 2024. We expect total and organic revenue growth in the Americas to be 1.5% to 3.5%. This is led by our non-residential business, forecast to grow low to mid-single digits organically. Please note, the non-residential business is inclusive of Access Technologies, starting this year. The residential business is expected to be flat to down slightly on an organic basis. Overall, for the Americas, we are expecting more normal seasonality with tough comps in the first quarter. For Allegion International, we expect total revenue to be up 1.5% to 3.5% and minus 1% to up 1% on an organic basis. Inorganic growth includes the recently announced acquisition of Boss Door Controls. While mechanical markets remain sluggish in international, I'm pleased with how the team executed to close out the year. We have a high quality portfolio and continue to see good growth potential in our international electronics and software solutions businesses. All in, for the company, we are projecting total revenue growth of 1.5% to 3.5%, with organic revenue growth of 1% to 3%. We expect to drive margin expansion consistent with our historical framework. We're confident in the execution playbook we have for 2024, given cost actions taken in '23 and a more modest inflation environment. Based on our strong operating momentum, prior cost actions, and more normalized inflation, we are projecting an adjusted EPS outlook in the range of $7 and $7.15. This represents growth of approximately 1% to 3% over the prior year period, inclusive of a $0.37 headwind from tax. Lastly, we expect our outlook on available cash flow to be in the range of $540 million to $570 million. While we are committed to balanced and consistent capital deployment, this guidance does not include future capital deployment beyond the recent acquisition of Boss Door Controls. Please go to Slide 12. Bottom line, I am very proud of the entire Allegion team's 2023 performance and grateful for the strong distribution partners and loyal customers we have. As we look ahead to 2024, we will continue to build on the Allegion legacy and deliver new value in access. Our team is focused on relentless execution of our strategy and balanced capital deployment against what we expect to be a stable market backdrop. We remain committed to putting our customers first and delivering our vision of enabling seamless access and a safer world. I look forward to updating you more in the future as we work to achieve another record year for Allegion and propel our company into its next decade of growth. With that, let's turn to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe O'Dea: Hi. Good morning. John Stone : Good morning, Joe. Mike Wagnes : Good morning, Joe. Joe O'Dea: Wanted to start on op margin in '24. It looks like year-over-year margin expansion maybe in the 60 bps kind of range. So it would fit within the 50 bps to 100 bps, I think, medium-term target, but also comes off a pretty tough comp where you just did 160 and so, I think maybe a little bit better than anticipated. Can you just talk about the drivers of that year-over-year expansion that's embedded in terms of price, productivity, inflation, sort of how much of that is driven by it? And then also how much is already kind of in there in terms of carryover price, price that you've announced, cost actions that you've taken versus how much you still have to go get? Mike Wagnes : Yes. Thanks for the question, Joe. You're correct in that. If you look at margin expansion, a big driver of that is the price productivity in excess of inflation and investments. As you look at our topline guide, our pricing is going to be a driver of growth. If you think about midpoint, it's going to be the biggest driver of growth. As a result, you will get margin expansion when you think about the '24 year. And in addition, when you think about the actions we've taken, biggest driver of price for us is our non-residential business in the Americas. Those pricing actions are -- have already been announced and in the marketplace. And then from cost actions, we've taken some cost actions in the fourth quarter of '23. As a result, we're positioned nicely. You should see an acceleration of productivity in 2024. So, when you think about our margin outlook, the actions have been taken and we're positioned well in order to achieve that outlook. Joe O'Dea: That's really helpful. And then in terms of non-res and the growth outlook in Americas, can you unpack a little -- that a little bit by vertical then to talk about sort of electronics versus mechanical, but then institutional versus commercial, I think a lot of focus on sort of office and headwinds out there. But what you see on kind of new versus renovation, just trying to understand some of the moving pieces within that growth in non-res. John Stone : Yes, Joe. This is John. I appreciate the question. I think as we showed, the institutional verticals, they're less volatile than the commercial leaning verticals and have still been flashing some positive data on starch. So we -- and our businesses, as you know, is a little bit heavily tilted to those vertical. So we feel good about that space. It's stable. The commercial, that's a wide basket of end users. So it's everything from data centers to retail to office to multifamily. We put that in the commercial bucket as well. And certainly, commercial office on the new construction side is soft and has been for quite some time. We think that will continue. Multifamily has been slowing as well. So we're not counting on a dramatic snap back there. We do see strength like everybody has been talking about in data centers, that's a highly spec application of our high end electronic products. And I'd say on balance, you add all that up, the puts and the takes, and complement that with -- again, if you think of Allegion has about 50-50 new construction to aftermarket exposure. The aftermarket is quite stable across all verticals, break fix, repair and maintenance, even some tenant turnover here in commercial office. So the aftermarket is still, I think, pretty stable and underpins the overall portfolio, that's what leads us to come up to low to mid-single digits for growth in non-res. The only other item to mention since we do include Access Technologies and non-res for this year and going forward is big retail chains with store renovations and things like that also makes for a rather stable outlook on the Access Tech, the automatic doors business, that's kind of how we would see the whole basket. Joe O'Dea: I appreciate the details. Thanks. John Stone : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Vivek Srivastava : Hi. This is Vivek Srivastava on for Joe. Thanks for the question. My first question is just on the cadence of organic growth. It just looks like in first quarter '23, you had a big backlog burn, so that will be a tougher comp. Is it fair to say, you probably have a slightly negative organic growth in first quarter and then it ramps up to maybe closer to mid-single digit level in the second half? Mike Wagnes : Yeah. Thanks for the question. Clearly, Q1 is going to be our most challenging comp when you think about the '24 year. We don't give quarterly guidance. But if you recall, we burned through that backlog Q1 of '23. So when you think about our cadence for top line, \u201823 was not a normal year, right? When we think about '24, I think there's more normal seasonality. So we're a little more back half loaded than first half loaded from a top line. Don't want to get individual quarter forecasting. As you know, we don't give quarterly guidance. But just remember, a little more back half than first half from the top line as a company and that we do have that really challenging comp in the first quarter when you model year-over-year. Vivek Srivastava : Thanks. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on the International segment margins. It was impressive to see that in fourth quarter despite negative organic growth, you expanded over 100 basis points of margin. Could you talk about what drove that strong margin expansion in fourth quarter and then just expectations in that segment for margins in 2024? Mike Wagnes : Yeah. Super pleased about our international business when you think about the margin performance. If you look at our 10-year history, that business is breakeven when we spun out a decade ago. Now we\u2019re driving good healthy margin expansion. It\u2019s a much healthier portfolio. When you think about that electronics and software businesses, we\u2019ve been talking about the last few years, strong \u2013 stronger businesses from a margin perspective and top line. So really doing some good work to drive productivity in the region, pricing excellence. Tim, he took the excellence we had in the Americas and brought that to International as well. So a lot of things favorable for International as we think about the business for \u201823 and more importantly, moving forward. Vivek Srivastava : Great. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Sprague : Hi. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just coming back to just the seasonality comment. I know you don't do want to get into quarters, but are you comfortable with us kind of assuming kind of the pre-COVID period, call it, 2014 to 2019 is what you mean by normal seasonality as we look into Q1? Mike Wagnes : Yeah, Jeff. If you look at half, I'd like to talk about it in halves. I think that '14 to '19 is kind of a normal seasonality when you look at the half years. And we expect to be more in line with that a little more back half weighted than first half. Jeffrey Sprague : Okay. Great. You just give us a little more color on Boss to size the profitability, what impact, if any, it has on international margins? Mike Wagnes : Yeah. Jeff, if you think about that business, organic -- I'm sorry, inorganic growth for International, you would assume -- about half of that inorganic growth we've highlighted in the outlook is coming from the Boss Door acquisition, the other half coming from currency. So you could see it's a pretty -- it's a smaller acquisition. It's not a massive size. So from a price now on the top line, you have an idea that it's not a huge acquisition, but it's a nice complement to our business. We're really strong at writing specifications in North America. This is bringing that spec writing capability to a large country in Europe like the U.K. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. And then, hey, John, earlier in your opening remarks, you mentioned this new Schlage electronic product. Can you just maybe provide a little bit more color overall on what you're expecting for electronics growth in 2024? Is there a measurable impact on your investment levels to drive that, etc.? John Stone : Yeah. It's a good question, Jeff. And I think if listen to the prepared remarks in 2022, strong electronics growth, 2023, around 20% electronics growth. So I mean, over the long haul, long term, like we said at Investor Day back in May last year, think of our electronics performance of high-single, low double-digit growth driver for Allegion. We\u2019ve definitely given backlog burn and things in 2023, we\u2019ll have some tough electronics comps here and there. But demand is still strong. The secular trend still remains this migration to electronic access control for better security and better convenience is still moving and underway. We\u2019re still investing there. XE360 is just on that was very timely to highlight for us given the flexibility and interoperability that, that brings to the market. And also just to highlight the ease of upgrade of that in the field. We\u2019re also pretty excited about that. I mean the flexibility that\u2019s going to offer the end users is quite interesting and quite attractive for us. I think as you \u2013 as we move through 2024, you can continue to see, I think, an emphasis from us on things like product vitality, you\u2019re going to see a steady stream of new product launches just like this, and we look forward to highlighting those for you. Jeffrey Sprague : All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Maybe just the first question. You talked about some of the color by end market vertical earlier. And maybe one, I guess I wanted a bit more color on was the education vertical. I think it's one of your largest. So maybe any sense of kind of scale of how much of your business is education today and how do you see the outlook there? There have been some good tailwinds depending on product types from the education stimulus three years ago or maybe 70% of the way through that spend now. So how do you see that kind of tailing off and what does it mean for your education vertical growth rates from here? John Stone : Yeah. I think, Julien, when you look at our Americas business, we would say we're in the range around 45% of that business would be institutional. Institutional, of course, would be education, also health care, some government institutions in there. Education, K-12 and higher ed have been quite stable. I think when you see the things that Allegion invests, human capital as well as product investments and terms of helping drive safer schools. It's one, it's a really important mission. We're very active in the partner alliance for safe schools, advocate for proper standards, make sure people are aware and educated on proper standards. And then yes, that is a substantial portion of our business. But 45% of Americas is institutional -- it's a stable vertical. I think you can look around the country, you can see some big bond referendums lately. Those can lead sales by a year or two years or more in some cases. In any given year, certain portions of school budgets, of course, go to safety and security. And we want to make sure people understand proper standards and advocate for that. And if you recall, again, one of the products we highlighted at our Investor Day, these indication lots that just provide a visual indication of the lock status critically important. We've got a great portfolio there, and that's continuing to drive value into that vertical. So I think stable would be the outlook that we would see kind of consistent with the Dodge starts -- chart that we showed you. I think in that low to mid-single digit growth driver. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. Thank you, John. And just my second one would be following up on the operating margin outlook. So I just wanted to check, is the right way to think about it that you referenced that kind of 60 bps average on Slide 10 from price productivity inflation investment net. Is that really sort of the -- essentially the margin expansion guide for 2024 simplistically? And then we assume that things like mix and volume sort of netting off against each other? I just wanted to check that that's the right assumption. And any color you could give on the corporate cost outlook for the year. Mike Wagnes : Yeah. So as you know, Julian, we don't guide margins per se. However, we do give top line, bottom line, other estimates. So you can back into a margin rate. I think one, Joe kind of talked to margin rates earlier in the call as well. From a business perspective, you can see corporate being flattish for us year-over-year. With that element, you can kind of back into the respective region margin rates. And the big driver to the expansion, like, I mentioned earlier, is that price productivity in excess of investments and inflation. Lastly, you asked about mix, historically, mix is not a huge mover of margin rates for us. They can move around a little, but it\u2019s not something that drives significant changes in our margin profile for a full year. Julian Mitchell : Understood. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Brett Linzey : Hey. Good morning, all. John Stone : Hi, Brett. Mike Wagnes : Hi, Brett. Brett Linzey : I wanted to come back just to price volume, Mike, I think you said a good portion of organic growth was price generation. I guess is it safe to assume the volumes are assumed flat to maybe negative for the year? And then, any context on the non-res versus resi volume outlook for this year as well? Mike Wagnes : Yeah. So as you know, Brett, we don't give subsegment outlooks of volume and pricing, especially on the pricing dynamic. Don't want to share that. In general, think of us as -- at that midpoint, this is a price driven outlook from actions that have already been announced in the marketplace. And then as markets -- if markets are better than we think, we're going to be able to participate in that upside if there is market upside from a volume perspective. And then I think that answers your question, there might have been another element if there is, just remind me. Brett Linzey : Yeah. No. Thanks for that. And then maybe just shifting to the available cash flow. I think implicitly in that 90% ZIP code, but you did have some working capital draw down last year. Is that the right type of conversion you're thinking about? And then I guess what kind of leverage you back up to that kind of 95 to 100 historical range you guys have generated in the past? Mike Wagnes : Yeah. So you got to look at it one or two ways, either on an adjusted basis of net income, adjusted net income or on the reported \u2013 on an adjusted basis, we\u2019re at that 90%, which is roughly historical, even a little better than historical from a business, we have improved working capital in 2023. Expect that to continue in \u201824, really focused on the inventory front, where we\u2019re going to drive increased turns and be more efficient as we manage our inventory. But from a conversion perspective, roughly in line with historical performance. Brett Linzey : All right. Appreciate the detail. Operator : The next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Please go ahead. Tim Wojs : Hi, guys. Good morning. Maybe just, first one, just on investments. I know you guys don't disclose the number anymore in the 10-Qs and the 10-K. But I was just kind of curious how you kind of frame go-forward investments in terms of the incremental dollars you'd spend in any given year, if 2024 would be kind of assumed as a kind of a normal year or if there are some discrete investments around some of the software development and new products and things you want to call out? Mike Wagnes : Tim, look for us to always continually invest in our portfolio and our business to drive organic growth, especially in software and electronics. That is something we've been talking about driving growth and investing in our business for a decade and expect that to continue. Tim Wojs : Okay. So no changes there. Okay. And then, Mike, you said that if the market was kind of better than you thought you'd be able to participate in some upside, I guess, how would you frame your backlog kind of heading into '24 versus maybe a normal year? And if there was upside, where do you think the most likely source of that would come from? Mike Wagnes : As you know, Tim, we're a made-to-order business predominantly. We -- if you think about '21 backlogs in '21, early '22, they got really extended because of our inability to ship efficiently. We're now back to that normal lead time book and ship business. So I would say it's a normal lead time for customers and our ability to serve them. And so backlog is not what it was two years ago when we were talking about extended backlogs and dissatisfied customers, right? It's about serving our customers, and I think we're doing a much better job today than a couple of years ago. Tim Wojs : Okay. And I guess if there's any source of upside, I mean, as you look at the business, where do you think that most likely come from? Mike Wagnes : We talked about it as a company, where our outlook is. We see the stability in the institutional markets. Residential, we see as soft, right, if residential is better than we think. Hey, we have a great brand that SLA (ph) brand, we'll be able to participate. But for right now, we see the strongest markets being the institutional and the non-res side, as we laid out in the prepared remarks. Tim Wojs : Okay. Very good. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Hi, guys. Good morning. Mike Wagnes : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Can we just go back to International because I looked at my model and it's quite fascinating, right? If you look at 2018, just year-over-year comps I think revenues have declined with the exception of one year very, very consistently, yet the margins are materially higher when they were back then sort of underscoring what you've said. So can you just give us a little bit more color because I think in the 10-K, you've also highlighted that portable securities, I think, dragging volumes in '23, and I thought that was mix helpful to the mix in international. Just can you just give us a little bit more color? Is it Europe? Is it Asia? Is it Australia and New Zealand? Is it Interflex? Because under the surface, something is going really, really well there. Just give us a little bit of color there over the long term. Thank you. John Stone : Yeah. Andrew, really appreciate the question and the chance to highlight what we feel is just outstanding performance by the Allegion international team. I think the soft points, certainly, China is still soft, particularly on the residential side of the market, that's all over the headlines, and we felt that too. Our exposure there is rather muted. I would say, we took some portfolio absence over time to just raise the overall portfolio quality of our international business. Our teams are executing very well on productivity in international despite rather soft mechanical volume markets. And then our electronics business, the SimonsVoss and the Interflex team have really come together extremely well. They're driving growth. They're driving margin expansion, finding new customers and then performing really, really well. As one of the things that make us so excited about the Boss Door Control acquisition. And while Mike indicated, it is rather small. It's strategically significant for us because it does help us get into more of that architect, channel, more spec-driven business in the U.K. and excited about that potential from a strategic standpoint there. So I think -- the international team has been performing very well on portfolio quality overall is better and execution by the team has been outstanding. Andrew Obin : I'll take that answer. Thanks a lot. And just to follow up on North American Residential. When do you think just the volumes to bottom out? Is it a \u201824 event or is this sort of something beyond the scope of \u201824 volumes in North American resi? John Stone : So probably tough to call. I've seen others eager to call a bottom. I think our outlook contemplates a flat to slightly down end market and that's what we see today. If there are any meaningful changes in interest rate environments that might be a spark that starts up secondary home sales. But I'd say, we're going to remain cautious on our outlook for the residential segment in Americas. Andrew Obin : And if I could just squeeze one more in, sorry. Pricing has been very solid, particularly on a two year stack. Would you say that pricing has been stickier than you would have expected earlier in the year. If we would go back 12 months ago, would you say the pricing is stickier than you would have expected or about where you thought it would come out. Thank you. John Stone : I would say this, Andrew, as you know, we price for value. We had significant inflation over a multiple year period -- our industry puts in price increases. So it tends to lag a little some of the inflation dynamics. So you have to look at it on a multiyear basis. But in general, we price for value as a business and as an industry. And so pricing tends to be sticky. It's in list prices. And so from a dynamic, just don't forget, you have to look at the massive inflation we saw over a multiple year period and think of the pricing in that context. Andrew Obin : Okay. Thanks so much. John Stone : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Please go ahead. Chris Snyder : Thank you. John, I believe in the prepared remarks, you talked about how Allegion is a very late cycle business and starts can lead the company by more than 12 months. So when -- and I know, I guess, Americas non-res has stated organic positive, but the growth has decelerated a lot here over the last two to three quarters. But starts only really came down maybe two quarters ago. So when we see that deceleration or softening in the non-res Americas growth rate, is it fair to assume that that's really just been the channel destock and any sort of cycle pressure that could come from those starts is still on the horizon? Just any way to help think about that. Thank you. John Stone : Yeah. It's a fair set of questions there. And I think the channel destock that was, in our opinion, a rather unique and temporary phenomenon that just happened because of all the supply chain disruptions and the lead times got extended and backlogs got extended and ordering patterns were disrupted. I think you saw that manifest itself in late 2022 through about mid '23. We feel like most of that is in the rearview for the industry. In fact, published lead times from Allegion, from our couple of key large competitors are largely back in line with what you would expect. Book and ship business, like Mike was saying earlier. And so I think the vertical mix has been rather volatile. The institutional segment is stable, but the commercial vertical mix has been a bit volatile, right, with office being soft. Multifamily was very strong. Multifamily has been softer a little bit. Data centers have been extremely robust. Warehouses have now been very weak. So you have to kind of disaggregate to see the drivers and then reaggregate to see the total outlook that we're contemplating here for 2024, where we would still say low to mid-single digit growth for the non-res part of our business. Chris Snyder : I appreciate that. And maybe just a follow-up on Americas margins, up about 200 basis points this year in the absence of volume growth. So it's really supportive. And I understand that price cost is recovering and productivity is getting better. But I guess my question is, is it getting increasingly difficult or is there a point where you guys kind of run up on a glass ceiling there in Americas margins until maybe the cycle gives you enough to start driving positive volume growth at some point in the coming quarters? Thank you. Mike Wagnes : Yeah, Chris. Clearly, there was some catch up this year. As I mentioned earlier, the inflation was before the pricing a few questions ago. When we think about this business though, I think it's important to understand, we had some challenges operationally over the last few years as well that started to get better in '23. And for '24, we should be more efficient and more productive as well. So it\u2019s not just the pricing element, you will see in \u201824, an acceleration of productivity, which should give us some tailwinds for margins. But if you think long term, clearly, long term, you have to have some volume growth to drive margin expansion. But for the 24 \u2018year, you will see us operate more efficiently and accelerate productivity to help drive that margin expansion. Chris Snyder : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Stone, President and CEO for any closing remarks. John Stone : So thanks, everyone for a great Q&A. I think when you look back on 2024 a year from now, we expect you'll see an organization that delivered on margins and continue to show proof-points on organic growth and capital allocation, along with continuing to drive forward our strategy on seamless access. I think you\u2019ll see we\u2019re making the right investments to reinforce our strategy and reward our shareholders through balanced and consistent capital allocation. Thank you very much. Be safe. Be healthy. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Josh Pokrzywinski, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Thank you, Drew. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Allegion's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are John Stone, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Wagnes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial officer of Allegion. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we will refer to in today's call, are available on our website at investor.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website. Please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our most recent SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Today's presentation and commentary include non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details. Please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to John. John Stone : Thanks, Josh. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Allegion is off to a solid start in 2024, and I'm very proud of our entire team. I'll walk through some of the top Q1 highlights briefly, and will share more on each of these through the course of the presentation. Institutional markets remain healthy as we expected, our team continues to leverage our capabilities in spec writing, made-to-order manufacturing and strong distribution partnerships to best serve our end user customers.  We're executing at a high level, expanding margins in the quarter and delivering balanced capital allocation. As previously announced, we acquired Boss Door Controls and Dorcas in Q1 and returned cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Driven by our vision of enabling seamless access in a safer world, Allegion's Q1 performance has set a solid foundation for the year. We're performing well, and we're affirming the 2024 outlook we provided to you in February. Please go to Slide 4. Allegion continues to deliver on balanced and consistent capital allocation and our Q1 performance showcases this. We continue to invest for organic growth, building on the legacy of our flagship brands delivering new value and access through industry-first innovations and nurturing strategic relationships to be the partner of choice. In March, Schlage announced a new smart lock integration with Airbnb to help improve and simplify host and guest experiences alike. Our integration means most Airbnb hosts with listings in the U.S. and Canada can now provide the seamless access experience to guests with the industry-leading Schlage Encode smart lock family directly within the Airbnb app. Host can streamline the check-in and checkout process with automatically generated guest access codes, removing the need to manually create unique codes for each visitor. Access codes are shared with guests at the time of booking, and those codes are only active during their trip, automatically deactivating after checkout. Hosts can make any needed adjustments to their guest check-in and checkout times in the Airbnb app, which will automatically update the smart lock, keeping them in control of the access experience, while guests can rest easy with the peace of mind brought by having Schlage on the door. The smart lock integration within the Airbnb app is currently only compatible with Schlage, making this another industry first for our company.  Allegion also continues to be a dividend-paying stock. And as a reminder, in February, we announced our tenth consecutive annual dividend increase. For the quarter, this amounted to approximately $42 million in cash returned to shareholders. Additionally, in Q1, we closed 2 bolt-on acquisitions. During our last earnings call, we discussed the February acquisition of Boss Door Controls in the U.K., which brings a strong architectural channel and a flexible supply chain while positioning us to increase our spec-driven business in Allegion International. In March, we acquired Dorcas, a leading manufacturer of electromechanical access control solutions based in Spain. Dorcas' solutions are distributed and sold internationally with a strong presence across European markets, including in the education and health care verticals. Their electric strikes and locks are integral elements of access control systems and bringing this business into Allegion International is another strategic investment in the quality of our portfolio there. Lastly, in the first quarter, we made additional share repurchases amounting to approximately $40 million. Overall, I'm happy with the balanced capital allocation you see here on this slide. We continue to invest in the core, continue growing the business and continue returning cash to shareholders. Mike will now walk you through first quarter financial results, and I'll be back to provide some final thoughts. Michael Wagnes : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to Slide #5. As John shared, our team's Q1 performance reflects a solid start to 2024. Revenue for the first quarter was $893.9 million, a decrease of 3.2% compared to 2023. Organic revenue declined 3.6% on a challenging prior year comparable, which was up 15%. Q1 2023 experienced abnormally strong seasonality as the business recovered from previous supply chain interruptions. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 40 and 50 basis points, respectively, in the first quarter, driven by price and productivity in excess of inflation and investment. The team executed well to deliver margin expansion despite the volume declines. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.55 decreased $0.03 or approximately 1.9% versus the prior year. Volume declines and tax headwinds more than offset margin expansion and interest and other favorability. Finally, Q1 2024 available cash flow was $23.9 million, which was a 48.8% decrease versus last year and represents a return to historical norms. I will provide more details on our cash flow and balance sheet a little later in the presentation.  Please go to Slide #6. This slide provides an overview of our quarterly revenue. I will review our enterprise results here before turning to our respective regions. Organic revenue declined in the quarter by 3.6% as a result of the tough comparable I just mentioned. We saw the business returning to more normal seasonality in Q1 2024 versus what we experienced last year. Currency and acquisitions drove additional favorability in the quarter, bringing the total reported decline to 3.2%. Please go to Slide #7. Our Americas segment delivered strong operating results in Q1. Revenue of $709.3 million was down 4.3% on both the reported and organic basis as favorable pricing more than offset lower volumes. On a 2-year basis, our Americas business grew approximately 17% organically. Our nonresidential business, inclusive of Access Technologies, declined mid-single digits against the prior year comp that grew nearly 30%. Residential markets remained soft with our business down low single digits in the quarter as higher interest rates continue to impact new and existing home sales. Demand for electronics in our Americas business remained strong. While revenue was down low single digits in the quarter against a tough comp, our electronics business has grown nearly 30% over the last 2 years. Americas adjusted operating income of $197.3 million decreased 0.4% versus the prior year period due to lower volumes. However, adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter were up 120 and 140 basis points, respectively. Overall, our Americas team continues to execute well and operate efficiently, driving margin expansion through price and productivity in excess of inflation and investments despite lower volumes.  Please go to Slide #8. Our International segment continues to see a challenging macroeconomic environment. Revenue of $184.6 million was up 1.4% on a reported basis but down 0.8% organically. Price realization was more than offset by lower volumes associated with soft end market demand. Currency and acquisitions were a tailwind this quarter, positively impacted reported revenue by 0.8% and 1.4%, respectively. International adjusted operating income of $19.3 million decreased 2% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter decreased 40 and 50 basis points, respectively. Price and productive tailwinds, covering inflationary pressures, but modest volume declines resulted in lower year-on-year margin rates. Please go to Slide #9. As I mentioned earlier, year-to-date available cash flow came in at $23.9 million, down $22.8 million versus the prior year. Q1 2023 cash flow was particularly strong as it benefited from supply chain lead time reductions, while the current year is more in line with historical norms. Next, working capital as a percent of revenue increased primarily driven by higher receivables as a result of timing of revenue and collections within the quarter versus the prior year. Finally, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA remains at a healthy ratio of 1.9x, consistent with where we finished 2023. Our business is generating strong cash flow and our balance sheet supports continued capital deployment. I will now hand the call back over to John. John Stone : Thanks, Mike. Please go to Slide 10. As we did last quarter, I want to spend a moment to highlight some of the key factors that we believe distinguish Allegion's business model and how we win in the marketplace. We continue to see favorable long-term demand drivers, particularly in our core institutional markets. Projects in these markets are largely funded outside of traditional bank financing and may be more commonly funded by municipal bond issuance. Bond issuance has continued its steady long-term growth with cycles around election year referendums. Issuance continues to support our view for stable institutional market demand as we progress through 2024. Moving to the right side. We feel strongly we have a winning formula that comes from bringing the depth of Allegion expertise into these attractive markets. Our team has notched multiple health care wins in 2024, our traditional mechanical hardware and sliding door solutions have a strong value proposition in this vertical and the service capability we acquired with Access Technologies frequently puts us over the top. This shows the value we unlock through M&A as we continue to deploy capital and broaden our portfolio as a pure play in security and access. Please go to Slide 11. In summary, Allegion's first quarter was marked by strong execution. Our team expanded margins and delivered balanced capital allocation, and we're affirming our full year 2024 outlook. It's noteworthy to share that Allegion was named a 2024 Gallup Exceptional Workplace Award winner earlier this month. This highly competitive award recognizes Allegion as 1 of the most engaged workplaces and it's a testament to the dedication of all 12,000-plus Allegiant employees.  Our team truly believes in Allegion's responsibility to keep our employees safe, operate sustainably, live up to high ethical standards and serve our local communities. By living our values and increasing employee engagement, we accelerate Allegion's success and advance our vision of enabling seamless access in a safer world for you. I'm proud of the progress we're making and grateful to be a part of this high-performing team. Okay. Let's turn to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Matthew Pan : This is Matthew Pan from Julian Mitchell's team at Barclays. Just the first one, kind of thinking about seasonality, Q2 is typically about 25% of the year's earnings. Any reason that might be different this year? Michael Wagnes : Thanks for the question, Matt. When you think about our year, I would say return to normal seasonality is a theme that we said last year was abnormal. As far as individual quarters, we really don't like giving individual quarterly guidance, as you know. I would just say, as you think about our business, don't think of last year as normal. Think of maybe some of the history that we had in the past where the summer months have more revenue. Like many companies that deal with the construction industry, we have more revenue in the summer months, the middle 2 quarters, with the revenues on the book ends 1 and 4 being a little less. So our business tends to have a little more revenue in the back half of the year than the first half. But in general, think of '24 as a return to more normal seasonality versus what you saw in '23. Matthew Pan : Got it. And then just 1 follow-up. Lennox talked about some project delays in commercial construction and Otis was pretty downbeat on new orders. Does Allegion see any sort of project delays or any worse market outlook in the Americas nonresi piece versus, say, 6 months ago? John Stone : Yes. So this is John. I appreciate the question. I think we would just go back to some of the prepared remarks, where we see Allegion's business is rather heavily weighted towards institutional, which, as we indicated, has more public financing type avenues to market. And the institutional segment is stable. And I think in the commercial space, if our commercial business is kind of split between office, multifamily and then kind of everything else, which would include retail, which would include warehouses, manufacturing, data centers, there are certainly pockets of strength and pockets of weakness. I think the broad portfolio and the broad end market exposure we have, that's what comes together and gives you the guide that we're contemplating for 2024, the outlook that we're contemplating. And so institutional, stable. Bond issuance actually had a pretty strong Q1, if you look at that year-over-year, which gives us a good feel that our outlook is pretty solid. In terms of specifics, like did this project get delayed as you go through channel checks and as we get out and visit distributors and customers and things, yes, you do hear about that. You don't hear much in the way of cancellation. You do hear maybe a multifamily project is on hold for a little bit. You do hear some of that. But I'd say our business is more heavily weighted towards institutional and that segment is quite stable right now. Operator : The next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Joseph O'Dea: So I wanted to ask on Americas electronics. The downward single digit in the quarter on a tough comp, plus 30% to your stack still showing strong demand there. I guess just in terms of as you think about the year and what the comps look like in the remainder of the year, is this an area where you expect to see growth? Any context on kind of magnitude of year-over-year change for electronics demand in Americas on a full year basis? Michael Wagnes : Joe, if you think about -- thanks for the question. If you think about individual product lines, we don't guide a product line or electronics. What I would share with you, long-term growth driver. You can see this business on a long-term basis, delivering CAGRs of high single-digit to low double-digit growth for electronics. Clearly, last year, we had some catch-up associated with previous supply chain challenges. And so it was very robust growth that you saw, frankly, over the last 2 years. When you think of our electronics business, think of it as a long-term growth driver that's going to provide tailwinds for us to deliver above-market growth. Joseph O'Dea: Got it. And then also just related to the end markets and I guess, what we've seen recently in kind of ABI and Dodge Momentum, some of the softening there. Not really sure that, that kind of aligns with maybe the way you're characterizing things in particular, saw some softness related to Dodge Momentum in institutional markets. And really just interested on your perspective and what we're seeing in some of those leading indicators versus what you're seeing in spec writing and activity on the ground.  And especially as it relates to backlog of projects and the degree that, that could be weighing on some of the lead indicators where there's just a large backlog of projects. And so the stuff that's coming in might be a little bit slower just because of long lead times. So anyway, observations on kind of lead indicators. John Stone : Yes. This is John. I'll add some comments, I guess, to your comments, Joe. I think the lead indicators are what they are. I'd say we always got to be cautious not to read too much positive or too much negative into those. They're good signals, and we watch them just like you do. I think over the last like 18 to 20 months, institutional has been favorable when compared with some of the other commercial verticals. That does seem to play out in the end market as we get out and visit customers and distributors. I think the lead time that you brought up with construction labor shortages, projects taking longer, that probably is extending some jobs out, some projects out longer than maybe historically it has been. In terms of quantifying that in an impact and the Dodge Momentum or any of these indices, we're not the right people to do that. What I would say is, again, we see stable institutional markets as -- and again, that's where our business is heavily weighted. And the commercial segment of our business, you see a mixed set of verticals, just like we mentioned on the previous question. Our resi business, as we mentioned, is flat to slightly down. And in our outlook, we don't contemplate any dramatic changes or any dramatic tailwinds from those end markets, but feel good about the outlook we've provided. And I think initial start to the year affirms that for us. Operator : The next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Peter Costa : This is Peter Costa on for Brett. I just have a strategic question around the election and tariffs. Obviously, we don't know what the outcome looks like, but just understanding that Allegion has a manufacturing footprint outside the U.S. Can you just talk about how nimble your supply chain is and just your ability to flex around different regions should we enter a more aggressive tariff regime? John Stone : Well, let me -- this is John. I would just open with tariffs of any kind or not helpful to a company like Allegion in terms of our supply chain. I'd say we learned a lot of lessons as did everybody else over the course of 2022 and 2023. And in terms of supply chain resiliency, we feel a lot better about our position than we would have a couple of years ago. Not going to get into specifics of where we buy this part or that part or where we make this or that. But I would say, managing the portfolio of several million SKUs like we do, made-to-order environment in terms of supply chain and manufacturing, I'm quite confident in Allegion's capabilities regardless of tariff regimes or administrations. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Stone, President and CEO, for any closing remarks. John Stone : Well, thanks very much. And just to reiterate, we feel we're off to a solid start in 2024. We look forward to connecting with you again next quarter. Be safe, be healthy, everyone. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Josh Pokrzywinski, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Thank you Jason. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for Allegion's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are John Stone, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Wagnes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and the presentation we will refer to in today's call are available on our website at investor.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website. Please go to Slide 2.

Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details. Please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to John. John Stone : Thanks, Josh. Good morning everybody. Thanks for joining today. I can sum up this call and this quarter with four words; Stable markets, strong execution. And that strong execution was by the entire Allegion team and our distribution channel partners. That's the team that drove these record Q2 results. I'll briefly walk through some of the highlights for our quarter and updated full year outlook, and then we'll share more on each of these later in the presentation. Allegion Q2 revenue growth and margin expansion demonstrates the resilience of our business model. We see stability in demand given our broad end-market exposure and specification expertise. Our team continues to see strength in areas like institutional markets and data centers, further helped by our own investments in electronics and new product development. And as expected, we saw a return to volume growth and a seasonal bump in the quarter sequentially over Q1. We\u2019re accelerating capital deployment, returning cash to shareholders and investing in accretive acquisitions. We've announced four acquisitions already this year with Krieger Specialty Products and Unicel Architectural in Q2. Overall heading into the second half, we're executing at a high level. We are raising our full year guidance for reported revenue and adjusted earnings per share, and we are affirming our available cash flow outlook. I am very proud of how the Allegion team is living our values, while driving results for our customers and our shareholders. Please go to Slide 4. Allegion continues to pursue balanced, consistent capital allocation for the benefit of shareholders and to take advantage of the strong cash generation this business drives. We are investing for organic growth. In April, we introduced three new lines of Schlage indication solutions, a best-in-class lock portfolio with trims that allow users to more easily see the status of a door. Developed specifically with K-12 schools and higher education security needs in mind, our new locks have some of the largest indication windows on the market and differentiated 180-degree views. They offer unparalleled functionality and durability for Grade 1 fire-rated applications, in addition to tamper resistance and color-blind friendly backgrounds. Combined, these features allow for quick confirmation that doors are secured, providing teachers and administrators peace of mind and time, their most valuable resource when it matters most when every second counts. Allegion continues to be a dividend-paying stock. For the quarter, this amounted to approximately $42 million in cash returned to shareholders. We closed two bolt-on acquisitions in our Americas region in Q2, Krieger Specialty Products and Unicel Architectural. Krieger is a leading specialty door manufacturer with expertise in highly engineered, acoustical, high-security, thermal and radio frequency applications. Krieger products complement our hollow metal portfolio and are used in a wide range of facilities, including government agencies, data centers, concert halls and health care. Unicel is a leading manufacturer of advanced glass wall systems that support privacy, safety, energy efficiency and sustainability across institutional markets. This business is a natural extension of our core door and window systems portfolio of TGP, AD Systems and Stanley Access Technologies. Both Krieger and Unicel expand our portfolio with fast growing niche products for key verticals that will benefit from the strength of our spec writing capability and nationwide sales footprint. On a combined basis these businesses are accretive to overall Allegion growth rates and carry Allegion-like EBITDA margins in the low 20s. Total purchase price represents a valuation of approximately 10 times 2024 EBITDA. We are very pleased with the recent acquisitions we've made, strong management teams that have come on board and a great cultural fit with the employees that they bring to Allegion. We are excited to the future. Lastly in the quarter, we made additional share repurchases amounting to approximately $40 million. I am happy with the balanced and shareholder-friendly capital allocation that you see here on the slide, and Allegion continues to invest in the core, grow the business and return cash to shareholders. Mike will now walk you through the second quarter financial results, and I will be back to provide an update on our outlook and some final thoughts. Mike Wagnes : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to Slide Number Five. As John shared, our Q2 results reflect solid performance from the entire Allegion team. We continue to execute at a high level, delivering another quarter of strong margin expansion with mid-single-digit top-line growth, driven by both price and volume. Revenue for the second quarter was $965.6 million, an increase of 5.8% compared to 2023. Organic revenue increased 5.2% in the quarter as a result of favorable price and volume. We saw strength across both our Americas and International regions. Q2 adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 150 and 170 basis points, respectively driven by price and productivity in excess of inflation and investments, as well as favorable volume leverage. I'm very pleased with the operational execution and margin expansion in 2024. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.96 increased $0.20 or approximately 11.4% versus the prior year. Strong operational performance, accretive capital deployment and favorable interest and other more than offset the headwinds from higher tax. Finally year-to-date 2024 available cash flow was $176 million, which was a 7.4% decrease versus last year. I\u2019ll provide more details on our cash flow and balance sheet a little later in the presentation. Please go to Slide Number Six. This slide provides an overview of our quarterly revenue. I will review our enterprise results here, before turning to the respective regions. Organic revenue grew 5.2% in the quarter, comprised of price realization of 2.7% and volume growth of 2.5%. As I mentioned last quarter, we are seeing the business return to expected seasonality in 2024 versus what we experienced last year. As John discussed earlier, we're accelerating capital deployment and have made investments in inorganic growth in both our Americas and International segments. As a result, acquisitions drove almost a point of growth in the quarter. Currency was a slight headwind, bringing total reported growth to 5.8%. Please go to Slide Number 7. Our Americas segment delivered strong operating results in Q2. Revenue of $770.7 million was up 6% on a reported basis and up 5.7% organically as a result of favorable price and volume in the quarter. Reported revenue includes 0.4% growth from the acquisitions of Krieger and Unicel. Our non-residential business, inclusive of Access Technologies increased mid-single digits in the quarter as end-markets remained stable. Our residential business was up low-single digits in the quarter, showing an improvement versus the declines in Q1. Demand for electronics in our Americas region remained strong. While electronics revenue was down low-single digits in the quarter against a tough comparable, our business has grown well above 30% over the last two years for both the quarter and year-to-date. Americas' adjusted operating income of $226.2 million increased 9.9% versus the prior year period due to solid top-line growth and strong operational execution. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter were up 110 and 130 basis points respectively, as we continue to drive margin expansion through price and productivity in excess of inflation and investments. Overall, our Americas team delivered another strong quarter. Please go to Slide Number 8. Our International segment had a solid second quarter. Revenues of $194.9 million was up 5.2% on a reported basis and up 3.1% organically. Price realization and strength in our electronics business drove the growth in the quarter. Acquisitions were a tailwind this quarter, positively impacting reported revenues by 3.2% driven by the Dorcas and Boss acquisitions announced earlier this year. Currency, however was a headwind of 1.1%. International adjusted operating income of $23.6 million increased 12.9% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter both increased 80 basis points. Volume and favorable mix are driving the margin expansion, as well as margin accretion from our acquisitions. Please go to Slide Number Nine. Year-to-date available cash flow came in at $176 million down $14.1 million versus the prior year. We did see year-over-year growth in the second quarter this year. However, the first half of 2023 was particularly strong as it benefited from supply chain lead-time reductions. Next, working capital as a percent of revenue increased primarily driven by higher receivables, as a result of the timing of revenue and collections within the quarter versus the prior year. Finally, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA remains at a healthy ratio of 1.9 times, consistent with where we finished 2023. It is worth noting that our gross debt and cash balances include the proceeds from our $400 million senior note issuance in the second quarter, which will be used to repay a $400 million senior note maturity in the back half of 2024. This resulted in a slightly higher gross debt to adjusted EBITDA at the end of the second quarter, but has no impact on net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Our business continues to generate strong cash flow and our balance sheet supports continued capital deployment. I will now hand the call back over to John. John Stone : Thanks, Mike. Please go to Slide 10. Allegion is on track for record full-year revenue, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share in 2024. We are increasing our full year outlook on reported revenue and adjusted EPS, tightening our organic revenue range and affirming available cash flow. We now expect the Americas segment to be up 2.5% to 3.5% for total growth and 2% to 3% organically, led by our non-residential business. For International, we expect revenue to be up 3% to 4% in total including a 0.5% to 1.5% organically based on a solid start to the year, particularly in electronics and software. All in for the company, we\u2019re raising total growth to a range of 2.5% to 3.5%. Organically, we are tightening the range by 0.5 point on both ends to 1.5% to 2.5%. Based on our strong operational performance in the second quarter and capital deployment, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook by $0.15 to a range of $7.15 to $7.30. Lastly, we affirm our outlook on available cash flow to be in the range of $540 million to $570 million. Please go to Slide 11. Now two years into my role at Allegion, I want to take a moment to reflect. I feel very lucky and very humbled to stepped into such a great team and business. We overcame supply chain and inflationary disruptions, and are now putting up record revenues and margins. We have two new factories ramping up productions smoothly and safely. We have successfully integrated the largest acquisition in Allegion's history and have grown our business further with five additional bolt-on acquisitions. And earlier this year, we earned the Gallup Exceptional Workplace Award, an achievement that I\u2019d say is probably my proudest moment with Allegion so far. It is helpful to step outside the market discussion at the moment, whether it is supply chain and inflation as it was two years ago or Fed policy and macro data today. With Allegion, you will find a resilient business model, reflecting a strong value proposition, as well as opportunities to further drive growth and reward shareholders. It starts with the front-end and a spec engine that is always running and solving complex problems for our end-user customers, regardless of which non-res segment they're a part of. Plugging in bolt-ons like Krieger and Unicel into this spec engine creates additional value, as we bring heightened channel access to their strong niche products and help them grow. Our industry leading margins are the hallmark of a strong culture of execution at Allegion. We have a long standing track record of success on price and productivity that has created durable returns through the cycle. Allegion's broad portfolio and end-market exposure and mix of aftermarket and new construction further adds to the resiliency of our business. Our consistent balanced framework on capital allocation has allowed us to deploy approximately $280 million of cash flow year-to-date through accretive M&A and return of capital directly to shareholders. In summary, stable demand and strong execution by the entire Allegion team and our channel partners, drove record Q2 revenue and earnings per share results. We expanded margins and are accelerating capital deployment for the benefit of our shareholders, which supports our higher outlook for 2024. With that, let's turn to Q&A. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Wojs from Baird. Please go ahead. Tim Wojs : Hi everybody. Good morning. Nice job. Maybe just first question, just John, if you could maybe give us a little bit of color on what you are seeing on the spec side of the business within Americas. Just color on what you are seeing around like quoting and releases and maybe anything specific on end-markets. And then any sort of variances that you guys might be seeing from new construction and kind of re-modeling activity. John Stone : Yes. Thanks Tim. Appreciate the question. And I think channel checks recently, have been out in the field with our sales teams and our end-users and distributors, would indicate pretty much what we said at the outset that we are in, what we would just call, a stable demand environment, really driven by the institutional segments and the stability there. I think the specification activity is always on, just the way we said it in the prepared remarks. And our spec writers have the capability to flex to whichever vertical, whichever job that they need to. So whether it is an office building, whether it's a school, a university, a hospital, a data center, our spec writers can do it all. And so just think of that as a flywheel that doesn't stop. I'd say, on the -- just the demand side, certainly there is pockets of strength, pockets of weakness, like we've been saying for the last few quarters. That ebbs-and-flows, depending on where you are or which vertical you are looking at. But in general, I think, we would just stick with a stable demand environment, and we feel like our strength and our execution will differentiate us and we will outperform the market. Tim Wojs : Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then just on M&A, I would say, historically the pace of M&A has been kind of uneven at Allegion. It is kind of come in clusters in the past. And you've closed four acquisitions year-to-date and I'm just wondering if that represents a change in the underlying pace of activity from your perspective, where we should expect a lot more kind of tuck-in activity or if that is just kind of a function of timing again. And really, what I'm asking is, should investors start to think about a much more regular cadence of M&A going forward for Allegion on an annualized basis? John Stone : Yes, it's a great question, Tim and I appreciate that. And I\u2019d just reinforce, we are really pleased with the acquisitions we've tucked in this year. Every one accretive to EPS right out of the chute. We talked a little bit gave a little bit of an indication on the kind of valuation that we were looking at here in the Americas recently. And I would say, way back to as I first stepped in the seat, we talked about orienting Allegion more towards growth. We do want to be acquisitive. We don't want to become a serial acquirer that just wantonly buys anything. We want to be very strategic. We want to play to our strengths. We want to have acquisitions that complement our portfolio and bring benefits to our customers. We want to have returns that are accretive to our shareholders. And so each acquisition, each deal is going to take on a life of its own and so the timing is going to be what it is. But I\u2019d say, in terms of activity, our view would be -- my view would be the environment for strategics like Allegion is better than it was a year or two ago. We don't see that changing in the near-term, and we do see a good pipeline of opportunity. So I think you can look forward to seeing more quarters like you've seen these last couple from Allegion. Tim Wojs : Okay, great. Thanks for the time and good look on rest of the year. John Stone : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Hi, guys. Good morning. John Stone : Hi, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Hi. Maybe we can touch on Americas margins to start off. It is about the best margin we've seen in some time. And I'm just wondering on the sustainability of that margin going forward, what are the key levers? Especially impressive, given that you have margin-dilutive mix coming through in the Access Tech business. And so any color that you can provide on the go forward would be helpful. Mike Wagnes : Thanks for the question, Joe. We've been talking about this for some time. Our business, the way we manage it we drive pricing to cover inflation. We are going to drive productivity to fund our investments. And in aggregate, that price productivity investments and inflations dynamic is a net positive for us. We've shown that over many quarters now. We expect that to continue. From a pricing perspective in the Americas, that non-res business, it is very sticky. So we feel comfortable about the resiliency of the margin profile. And that productivity DNA that we have, we expect that to continue. So I would expect us to maintain these margins that you see. There was that temporary decline in 2021 and 2022, where we had supply chain challenges, that's kind of behind us now and we are in a good place. And I think from here, think of Allegion that you've known us over the last decade, where we are going to be driving that price and productivity to maintain and expand margins. Joe Ritchie : Yes. That's helpful. And John maybe just along that point, we have seen some commodities deflate to start the year. I'm just curious like what are you seeing in your core commodities? And how do you see the cost side of the equation evolving as we progress through the year? John Stone : Yes. It is a good question, Joe. And I think we had some rather extreme volatility in '21, '22. That volatility, for sure has dampened. And I'd say lately, it is kind of been not much of an event. You see little blips up and down, but generally within a range that's not concerning to us either way deflation or inflation on the raw mat side. And as Mike mentioned, I think we've got a whole host of pretty exciting productivity projects in the pipeline for our factories. And then again, two new factories ramping up that are going to drive more productivity in a couple of parts of the business that need it. So I would say, raw mat has been stable enough recently. We don't see anything dramatic on the horizon. Joe Ritchie : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe O\u2019Dea: Hi, good morning thanks for taking my questions. John Stone : Hi, Joe. Joe O\u2019Dea: Can you start on the International side, I think this is the first quarter of volume growth in a couple of years. And so just in terms of expanding on what you are seeing there and confidence that things could have turned and expectations for volumes as we move into the back half of the year. John Stone : Yes. So it is a great question, Joe. I'm glad you asked us. We've been dying for the chance to brag on International, because we think they've been performing extremely well. I would call your attention to over the past couple of years, there has been some intentional pruning in International just to exit a couple of underperforming businesses. So let us not forget that. The acquisitions made recently have been contributing favorably to growth in International as well. The demand for electronics and our software solutions has remained strong in the high single-digit range in International. Those businesses continue to outperform. And then I would say, even Portable Security, after many, many quarters of very tough end markets, turned positive on volume here in Q2. So really happy for them. They've done a great job managing margins over the past year, 1.5 years in really tough volume environments, and that turned positive as well. Overall, I\u2019d say, there is been just a ton of self-help work going on, on the mechanical side of our International business in addition to continued strong demand and strong performance by our electronics and software teams. Joe O\u2019Dea: And then also I wanted to get your views on institutional in Americas. I think maybe some kind of contrasting data points out there when we look at the Dodge Momentum, institutional looks soft. I think recently we had the AIA come out with new forecasts for 2025, it is actually got institutional up 4%. So pretty good. So I guess when you look at spec activity, when you peel back anything you understand about Dodge Momentum, just overall in terms of direction on institutional, and if you see sort of tailwinds, headwinds there based on spec activity. John Stone : Yes, it is a good question. And certainly, we watch the same leading indicators that you referenced. They have been pretty volatile. Some of them have been flashing negative for a long, long time now. I\u2019d say, in general, our view would be institutional segment has less volatility than maybe parts of the commercial segments. It is a bit more stable. And I think something else to look at that maybe wouldn't make it into an ABI or a Dodge Dart is municipal bond issuance, which is up about 30% year-to-date versus prior year period, which goes to funds, school budgets and things like that. Just something else to think about in terms of what's driving the activity, whether it is new construction or expansion or repair and maintenance, aftermarket type activity that's going on. I would say, the headline from the beginning of the prepared remarks is still the best takeaway, Joe. We see stable demand, but we feel like we're executing at a very high level. Joe O'Dea: That\u2019s great. I appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just a first question around the operations kind of guidance on the EPS tailwind. So you raised that, I think, at the high end and the low end, the organic growth guide is unchanged. So maybe just help us understand kind of what moved around in that? Was there just some conservatism and a cushion that you don't need anymore? Given we're at the halfway point of the year, did something move around in terms of, say, expectations on cost inflation? Any help on that, please, why that kind of operating guide has moved up for the year? Mike Wagnes : Yes. Thanks for the question, Julian. If you look at our first half, we're doing quite well on the margin front. And we've been talking about it, and I mentioned it earlier to the earlier question. Just driving that price and productivity, the actions we can control to push margins. And we feel we've made good progress. So although organically we tightened the guide, we feel that the margin performance has really performed well. And so we did raise a [$0.05] (ph) as you see in our operational performance. Julian Mitchell : That's great. And then maybe just my follow-up question would be around if we think about the residential outlook surprising, I think, to see a positive result there in the second quarter. Maybe just update us how you're feeling about that market. The sort of consumer discretionary side seems very weak more broadly, understanding though that locks is not that discretionary. So maybe just some color on resi-expectations for the year ahead. Thank you. John Stone : Julian, this is John. That's a super insightful question. And I think a couple of different things going on in res. You are right. secondary home sales are at really low levels, really depressed levels. Housing completions has kind of maintained a decent pace. So we are hearing some better growth sentiment from large national builders. Interest rates, though mortgage rates are still quite high depressing some activities. So you sum all that up, we feel really good about how our resi business has executed the first half of the year. That being said, still a bit of a cautionary outlook, a bit of a flattish outlook is what we are contemplating. And then any relief in the interest rate environment would definitely be a positive for us. And I think that seems to be what the broader market is waiting for. Julian Mitchell : Sounds great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Brett Linzey from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Brett Linzey : Hi, good morning. Congrats on a great quarter. John Stone : Thanks, Brett. Brett Linzey : Hi. Just a question on the electronic locks performance, better than I expected. The two-year stack did accelerate versus Q1. Would you attribute that to the improvement in the mix of the end-markets so multifamily, commercial softer; institutional, a little better? Or are you just seeing broader adoption across some of the different verticals? John Stone : Yes, Brett, it's a really good question. And I appreciate you looking at the comps and the two-year stack. It is relevant to [top-back] (ph) given the tail of those supply chain disruptions that we've dealt with through first half of 2023, et cetera. Demand is still strong, and it is broad-based, I\u2019d say, is the other conclusion. We see electronic locks being adopted in education, being adopted in health care, commercial office, multifamily, et cetera. It is broad-based adoption. The demand is still strong. And I think one of the key underlying growth drivers is still the leverage of the smartphone wallet, mobile credentials, digital credentials, digital identities that are now just increasing both the security of the access point, as well as the convenience, which is right up the middle of our seamless access and safer world strategy. You hear things from large university customers of ours that -- inbound students just flat-out refuse to carry a key or a plastic card these days and smartphone is a natural extension of their persona. So I see still tailwinds there in terms of electronics demand and adoption. And the work that we are doing in our hardware, the work we are doing in our software, as well as credential technology, really feel like Allegion is in a leading position here in the space and can continue to drive growth and good results. Brett Linzey : That's great. And then just a follow-up on the sales performance between new versus aftermarket. I understand you lose track of it at some point through the channels. But just curious if you had any granular color on how new construction versus aftermarket performed that you could glean through, whether it is lock categories or some other metrics. John Stone : Yes. It's a good question, Brett. And I think the most accurate way we can describe that as still think of us as roughly a 50-50 mix, and that -- those two 50s are not pinpoint precision numbers. You are right, selling through distribution and in some cases, two step distribution, you do lose sight of exactly where that goes. And I\u2019d say, it probably also depends on where you are in the Americas. If you're in a place where there's net migration, like a Texas or Florida, a new construction is probably more than 50% right now. If you are in some more mature markets, regions, Midwest or Northeast or whichever maybe, it is more heavily weighted towards aftermarket. That's why I'd say, on balance and in aggregate, it is still appropriate to think of us as about a 50-50 mix. The other thing I\u2019d say is that once you spec yourself in to a large institution, university campus, school district, et cetera that makes that aftermarket business really sticky. And so break, fix, repair maintenance, new wing or whatever expansion like-for-like, replacement is quite prevalent. And that's another important tailwind on the electronics side because we are seeing some early adopters of electronic locks now upgrading to a recent model after installing locks just six, seven years ago. So a faster replacement cycle is also showing up these days. Brett Linzey : Appreciate the insight. John Stone : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Please go ahead. David MacGregor : Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Pretty solid quarter. So congratulations there. John Stone : Thank you very much. David MacGregor : Yes, I guess we are going to be talking about tariffs a little more here over the next few months. So I was wondering if you could just remind us what was the tariff burden to earnings last time around? And what's changed since in terms of reshoring suppliers? And maybe what percentage of your North American COGS would now be sourced outside of North America? John Stone : Yes. Tough to break all that down. We'll see if Mike has anything to add, David. But this is John, I'll start. I'd say, for any global company like Allegion, tariffs in general are not helpful, right? That's not helpful to a company like Allegion. I would say -- I'd call you back to the near-shoring that Allegion invested in with our new factory in Quer\u00e9taro, Mexico. The ramp-up is going well. Our people are safe. They are focused on quality. The numbers are coming through just like we thought. Great culture, great team down there. And that's for a lot of our residential products, are manufactured between Quer\u00e9taro and our manufacturing campus in the Baja area that we have. I'd say, that investment did significantly derisk our supply chain, made our supply chain more resilient in terms of some product supply that used to be single-sourced and outsourced in China. And so we've acquired the IP, and we can produce that product wherever we want to now. We have that flexibility since we own the design. As well as shortening the supply lines, obviously, sourcing it close to home. I\u2019d say, now is not really the time to speculate about any future tariff regimes. We need to just wait and see how the policies evolve. But in terms of supply chain resiliency, I think the investments we've made over the past 18 months or so have been very well-placed and are delivering the kind of results that we'd like to see. Mike, anything you'd add? Mike Wagnes : Yes. If you remember, David we tend to manufacture in the region that we sell, right? So if you think of our Americas business, most of our non-residential business is really manufactured here in the United States. We do have some operations in Mexico as John mentioned, but we don't have a large supply chain where we are manufacturing our product in Asia and shipping it over here. If it is sold in the US, we tend to make it here as well. David MacGregor : Got it. Thanks for that detail. And just as a follow-up, I guess obviously not inventory in the specified business, but just wondering what you're seeing in terms of channel inventory in the commercial and the retail space? John Stone : Yes, it is a good question, David. And I think we operate and our distribution channel operates in a made to order environment. And so in general, our channel does not hold a lot of inventory, unless that's specific to their business model where they -- a particular distributor will want to hold some, whatever unique or rarely ordered SKUs, just to be that provider of choice in their market. So lead times over the course of 2023 progressed back down to the two-week to four-week range for most of our products that our channel is used to. Ordering patterns have adjusted pretty well I think. And so I guess what I\u2019d feel like is, similar like you saw with Allegion's seasonality Q1 to Q2, I think just kind of back to a more normal environment on the inventory side. And that's how we feel internally as well. I think our own inventory turns are up modestly this year. We feel good about that, good working capital discipline there. So my sense is our channel would feel the same. David MacGregor : Got it. Thanks very much. Good luck. John Stone : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] There are no more questions in the queue. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Stone, President and CEO, for any closing remarks. John Stone : Thanks very much everyone for joining. Appreciate your time. I think in summary, stable demand, strong execution by the entire Allegion team. And it is worth to call out, what I\u2019d feel, is probably the best field sales and marketing team and distribution channel organization in the industry. Very proud of how they've executed in Q2. Very proud of our Q2 revenue and EPS results. And we definitely feel like Allegion's best days are still ahead. Thanks everyone. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Josh Pokrzywinski, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Allegion's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are John Stone, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Wagnes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and the presentation we will refer to in today's call are available on our website at investor.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website. Please go to slide two. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Law. Please see our most recent SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Today's presentation and commentary include non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details. Please go to slide three, and I'll turn the call over to John. John Stone : Thanks, Josh. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We can sum up this quarter with stable markets and strong execution. Q3 marks another quarter of strong execution by the entire Allegion team, resulting in revenue growth and margin expansion, demonstrating the resilience of our business model. I'm especially pleased with the top-line growth in the quarter, and overall, demand remains stable and is supported by our broad in-market exposure and specification expertise. Institutional markets have continued to lead, while commercial verticals have been more mixed. We have accelerated capital deployment in 2024, returning cash to shareholders, and growing our business with accretive acquisitions. Our strong cash generation, balance sheet, and pipeline of opportunities continue to position us well for future capital deployment, creating long-term value for our shareholders. As we push to year end, I feel we're performing at a high level. We're raising our full-year guidance for EPS, and we're affirming our overall revenue with some small updates at the segment level. Additionally, we're affirming our available cash flow outlook. Later in the call, we'll discuss these full-year updates, as well as provide some initial thoughts on how we see the market shaping up for next year. Please go to slide four. Let's take a look at capital allocation. First, we continue to invest in the core to drive organic growth. In June, we introduced a new product line of Exit Devices, the Von Duprin 70 Series. Our 70 Series combines the quality and trust Von Duprin is known for as the creator of this product category, with the performance and value ideal for many modern applications, ranging from warehouse, industrial, office, multifamily, retail, and hospitality spaces. This new product line is backed by our expert safety and security consulting, specification writing, technical support, and training, and it highlights what we do well with our flagship brands like Von Duprin. We innovate for new markets while still expanding the core, a capability that's difficult to match but is a strength of Allegion. With the Von Duprin 70 Series, we're leveraging more than a century of experience in developing high-performance exit devices to meet the safe entry and egress needs of customers today. Allegion continues to be a dividend-paying stock. In the third quarter, this amounted to approximately $42 million in cash return to shareholders. Turning now to M&A, and as announced last week, we recently closed the acquisition of SOSS Door Hardware. SOSS manufactures premium door hardware primarily sold across North American non-residential markets. Best known for their line of invisible hinges, SOSS complements our core mechanical portfolio with fire-rated heavy-duty solutions for industrial, commercial, and institutional spaces. And like our other well-known brands, SOSS is an industry pioneer with more than a century of experience that makes it a category leader today. SOSS is a small bolt-on with Allegion-like margins. We expect SOSS to deliver solid returns accretive to EPS in 2025 in a space we know well as a pure-play leader in security and access. Lastly, in the quarter, we made share repurchases amounting to approximately $40 million. To sum up this slide, Allegion will continue to take advantage of the strong cash generation our business drives for the benefit of our shareholders. Mike will now walk you through the third quarter financial results. Mike Wagnes : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to slide number five. As John shared, our Q3 results reflect solid performance from the entire Allegion team. We continue to execute at a high level, delivering another quarter of strong margin expansion with mid-single-digit top-line growth driven by price, volume, and acquisitions. Revenue for the third quarter was $967.1 million, an increase of 5.4%, compared to 2023. Organic revenue increased 3.3% in the quarter as a result of favorable price and volume. We saw strength within our America segment with international organic revenue relatively flat in the quarter. Q3 adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin, both increased by 100 basis points, driven by price and productivity in excess of inflation and investment, as well as favorable volume leverage. I am pleased with the operational execution and margin expansion in 2024. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.16 increased $0.22, or 11.3%, versus the prior year. Strong operational performance, accretive capital deployment, and favorable interest in other more than offset headwinds from higher tax. Finally, year-to-date 2024 available cash flow was $388 million, which was a 21.1% increase versus last year. I am pleased with our cash flow and working capital management, and we'll provide more details a little later in the presentation. Please go to slide number six. This slide provides an overview of our quarterly revenue. I will review our enterprise results here before turning to our respective segments. Organic revenue grew 3.3% in the quarter, which included price realization of 1.8% and volume growth of 1.5%. Acquisitions drove approximately 2 points of growth in the quarter. Additionally, currency was a slight tailwind, bringing total reported growth to 5.4%. Q3 revenues were sequentially consistent with Q2 and reflects a more normal seasonality compared to an unusual 2023, as we indicated previously. Please go to slide number seven. Our America segment delivered strong operating results in Q3. Revenues of $782.4 million was up 5.6% on a reported basis and up 4.1% on an organic basis. Organic growth included both favorable price and volume in the quarter. Reported revenue included 1.6% growth from the June acquisitions of Krieger and Unicel. Our non-residential business increased mid-single digits organically in the quarter, as institutional end markets remained stable. Our residential business was up low single digits, similar to what we saw in Q2. Electronics revenue was down high single digits compared to Q3 last year, which included significant catch-up in volumes as supply chains recovered from disruptions that we experienced in 2021 and 2022. It's worth noting Q3 electronic revenue dollars were flat sequentially to Q2 levels, generally following the seasonality of the rest of the business. We continue to believe electronics are a long-term growth driver for Allegion. America's adjusted operating income of $231.1 million, increased 9.7% versus the prior year period due to solid top-line growth and strong operational execution. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter were up 110 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively, as we continue to drive margin expansion through price and productivity in excess of inflation and investments. Let's go to slide number eight. Our international segment had a solid third quarter. Revenue of $184.7 million was up 4.4% on a reported basis and up 0.2% organically. Acquisitions were a tailwind this quarter. Positively impacted reported revenue by 2.9%, driven by the Dorcas and Boss businesses. Currency was also a tailwind, contributing 1.3 points of growth. International adjusted operating income of $25.2 million, increased 6.3% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter increased 20 basis points and 10 basis points, respectively. Margin expansion was driven by price and productivity exceeding inflation and investments offsetting the volume decline. Please go to slide number nine, and I will provide an overview of our cash flow and balance sheet. Year-to-date available cash flow came in at $388 million, up $67.6 million versus the prior year. This increase is driven by higher earnings and improvements in working capital, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. Next, working capital as a percent of revenue improved, as we continue to focus on working capital efficiency to convert earnings to cash. Finally, our balance sheet remains strong, and our net-debt to adjusted EBITDA is at a healthy ratio of 1.7 times. It's worth noting our gross debt and cash balances at September 30, 2024, include the proceeds from our $400 million senior note issuance in Q2, which were used to repay a $400 million senior note on October 1. This results in a slightly higher gross leverage at the end of the third quarter, but has no impact on net leverage. Our business continues to generate strong cash flow, and our balance sheet supports continued capital deployment. I will now hand the call back over to John. John Stone : Thanks, Mike. Please go to slide 10. Allegion remains on track for record results in 2024. We are affirming our total reported revenue growth outlook of 2.5% to 3.5%. We're also affirming our total organic revenue growth outlook of 1.5% to 2.5%. Although, we now expect international organic revenue growth to be slightly higher and America's organic growth to be slightly lower than what we previously shared with you. The international team has executed well. As markets have been slow the past two years, there's now seen some stability in the mechanical portfolio. In the Americas, we're lapping record multifamily markets, which have slowed with higher interest rates this year. On balance, we'd still describe our markets as stable, particularly in the institutional verticals. We'll share more color on our markets on the next slide as we look forward to next year. Based on our strong operational performance in the third quarter, capital deployment, and a revised tax rate, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $7.35 to $7.45. Lastly, we're affirming our outlook on available cash flow to be in the range of $540 million to $570 million. Please go to slide 11. As you know, we'll provide Allegion's formal 2025 financial outlook during our February earnings call, but today we'd like to share a preliminary view on our key markets for next year. Overall, demand has been stable throughout 2024. Last quarter, we highlighted what makes our business model resilient, from our front-end spec engine that pulls product through the channel to our broad in-market coverage and large install base. And of course, strong execution by one of the safest, most engaged workforces in the industry, complemented by what is, without a doubt, the best distribution channel that the industry has. As we approach 2025, we see many of the same dynamics in place and do expect to grow organically. Starting with the Americas, macro indicators remain rather mixed. Institutional markets are stable and showing signs of modest growth. Commercial markets have been muted, and while we're encouraged by improvement in some indicators, the long-cycle nature of our business results in a lag versus planning and start data. Based on past starts, multifamily is one market likely to be slower as we enter 2025. We do expect America's residential markets to grow next year. As a reminder, we're mostly exposed to residential aftermarket and view existing home sales as an important driver of activity for us. For international, macro indicators remain soft. However, we have been in this environment for most of the last two years. As such, more moderate comparisons and continued strong execution should support growth in 2025. Finally, Allegion has a healthy balance sheet and strong cash generation that give us flexibility as we enter the new-year. We do expect capital deployment to drive additional earnings per share growth, focused on returns for our shareholders. Please go to slide 12. In summary, Q3 marks another quarter of strong results for Allegion. Our team continues to perform at a high level, driving revenue growth and margin expansion, demonstrating the resilience of our business model. We've seen stable markets this year and have accelerated capital deployment, and heading into the last few months of 2024, we're focused on meeting customer needs and delivering on our commitments to shareholders. With that, let's turn to Q&A. Operator : We now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Vivek Srivastava : Hi. Thanks for the question. This is Vivek Srivastava on for Joe. My first question is just on the America's non-residential business. The mid-single-digit growth this quarter is pretty impressive in light of all project delay. I mean, we've been hearing intra-quarters, so maybe could you help us understand, how is your visibility over the next 12 months based on specification activity in this vertical? And then, can you also provide any color on residential spec activity? John Stone : Yeah. So, let's talk non-res first and thanks for the question. I'd say, consistent with the slide and prepared remarks, we do continue to see organic growth. We do continue to see non-res overall as stable with some mix there in some of the commercial verticals like we indicated. Multifamily, we do expect it to be soft for a while, but on the institutional side, looking at leading indicators like Dodge Starch and Dodge Momentum would be indicative of the kind of activity that we're seeing in the market. If you look at municipal bond issuance this year, it's been very strong, up almost 30% year-to-date, which is an indicator of, again, spending in education, where safety and security are always on the list. And our advocacy and our activity promoting safe schools position us well to support customers there. So, I think, just consistent with what we shared with you on that last slide, we see overall stable markets for the foreseeable future led by the institutional verticals with some of the commercial verticals a bit more mixed. On the residential side, I think you asked about spec activity. We don't spec residential. We do participate primarily in the aftermarket on residential. We do see as the interest rate environment, as if that continues to improve, we do see signs that both on the new build side as well as the aftermarket side, there are signs that are indicating growth. Vivek Srivastava : Very helpful. And just a follow-up on just productivity, the equation pricing net of productivity and investment continues to remain positive through the year. Curious, where are you in your productivity journey versus pre-COVID levels? And what are the opportunities you see on key KPIs like, plant utilization levels as we enter 2025? Mike Wagnes : Yeah. So, really pleased with our productivity. If you recall the last couple of years, '21 and the beginning of '22, we really ran into challenges in our supply chain that resulted in us being inefficient. If you fast forward to, you know, the '23 and '24, much more efficient where we can drive productivity. And when you look at the equation and how we like to look at it, it's the price and the productivity that cover the inflation and fund the investments. And so, we've gotten margin expansion this year. Really pleased with the expansion, as I mentioned earlier. And just know, when you think of Allegion, Allegion is going to be driving the price and productivity to cover that inflation and fund investments on a go forward. Operator : Question from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe a first question just on the residential side of things. You know, I think about the sort of market outlook for next year. You talk about recovering starts on slide 11. And I think, it's about maybe just remind us it's sort of close to maybe 40% or so green field. So, just wanted to check that exposure. And when you look back historically at the business, what's the sort of typical lag from interest rates moving lower to seeing some help in your top line, whether residential green field or repair and remodel? Any sort of context around how your thoughts on that market have changed in recent months? Mike Wagnes : Yeah, thanks for the question, Julian. If you think of our resi business, certainly a little more is the aftermarket. So, you can think of it as roughly a third of our business is aftermarket. Retail being -- I'm sorry, two-thirds aftermarket. I apologize. Two-thirds aftermarket, a third new built. And retail being the biggest piece, think of like a Home Depot, a Lowe's, a customer like that, Amazon. And then with respect to building construction of new home, that could take six months to a year. It's not like an institutional building, so it is quicker responding to interest rates. And on the aftermarket side, I mean, that's consumer spending money. So, it is less determinate or less long, I would say, from a timing of recovery, when you think about versus the new build side. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. Thank you. And then as we're thinking about electronics, that market, you talk about growth in both electronics, America's-plus international next year. This year, I think still digesting sort of tough comps and the sudden easing of supply chain conditions. Remind us perhaps, what's the medium term electronics growth assumption as you see it globally? And as we think about 2025, you've had such volatility in recent years. Is it sort of trend growth realistic or we're still dealing with complications around comps and that type of thing for next year? John Stone : Yeah, Julian, appreciate the question. And you're exactly right. 2023 marked a lot of still wonky comps, particularly on electronics. And we're still dealing with, as you can tell, with the longest of the long tail of issues, particularly on a couple of high volume electronics locks. We do see, I would say, more, a more normal comp environment in '25. And for the foreseeable future, we do still see electronics adoption growing, we do still see electronics replacement cycle just kind of starting. So I think those two combined, we would be very consistent in our, our feeling that this is a high single to low double digit growth driver for Allegion over the cycle. And I think that's still our view as we look forward. Julian Mitchell : Great. And you have a chance of being in that range next year because of normal comps? John Stone : I'd probably, hesitate to give like too much of a breakdown of too much detail. We really intended just to give you a high level look into the market and the more specific detail would come in our February call for 2025 outlook. Julian Mitchell : Understood. Thanks very much. John Stone : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe O'Dea : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to start on some of the 2025 comments. And when you talk about a stable environment, moving forward, I think, you know, also saying in a stable environment, you would expect organic growth. But just want to make sure that in terms of moving pieces year-over-year, some of the more notable would be resi potentially getting a little better multifamily, potentially with some headwinds, just anything else in terms of as you look at a pipeline and think about developments next year versus this year and how the market sort of changes? John Stone : Hey, Joe, this is John. Appreciate the question. And I think, yeah, the overall macro look, we would just say is stable. We do see signs of America's residential improving. That's -- I think that's fair to say, the degree of which we need to come back to you in February and give you more detail there. On the non-res side, our view would still be and I think again, there's some Dodge indices you can reference that show that in the non-res side, the institutional verticals will still continue to lead the way. There is still, as we mentioned, a lot of municipal bond issuances this year, which does provide funding in the K-12 vertical where we're quite strong. You know, our business is a little bit heavily tilted to the institutional verticals as well. So you sum all that up. And there is mix in there, like you say, and it's fair to see multifamily has been kind of soft and probably stays kind of soft for a little while, data centers, as you know, have been exceptionally strong. We participate very well there. And so yeah, add it all up. Stable markets. Yep. And I think we do still see organic growth. Joe O'Dea : Perfect. I appreciate the color there. And then just in terms of the price cost environment, and as you're looking out in terms of pricing, and maybe fatigue from customers on inflation, and how you're thinking about the pricing opportunity environment, and just in terms of timing for us and sort of when you would be going to market, such that, any anticipated price next year would be out there? Mike Wagnes : Yeah, Joe, we're still in an inflationary environment. And in an environment where there's inflation, look for Allegion to drive pricing to cover the inflationary pressures. As to timing, we would always announce that to the channel before an earnings call. We have some history that you're pretty familiar with that you can get an idea of what the industry does. But just understand that, hey, we are in an inflationary environment. And as such, look for us to ensure that we manage the profitability by driving the pricing to cover the inflationary pressures. Joe O'Dea : Understood. Thanks a lot. Mike Wagnes : Thanks, Joe. Operator : The next question is from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. Good morning. This is [indiscernible] on for Brett Linzey. So just another on the on the spec side, what are you guys seeing? Just with the build out in international spec rating? And just how is that trending? Thanks. John Stone : Yeah, it's a good question. I appreciate that. I would say that has historically not been a strength for Allegion, but it is things that we have been investing in in capability. If you recall from our release earlier in the year, the acquisition of Boss Door Controls, that was also a step in the direction of more capability and more channel alignment with spec driven business there in the UK. We've been building out human resources, human capability, human capital there for that capability and international. And I'd say, it's early innings yet, but it is going to be an important part of the business as we go forward for international. Unidentified Analyst : Well, thanks. And then just I know you're calling it the muni bond issue and since being strong, feeding into education. But have you seen any change demand there just related to the sun setting of investor funding? John Stone : Yeah, so Esther was probably more directed at other products than ours. And so wasn't much of a tailwind and I don't see much-much change for our business there. Suffice it to say, as schools get funding, they have a lot of things they need to direct those funds too, safety and security are paramount in those budget exercises. And I'd say, we've released new products, we continue to write specs that keep schools up to code, we continue to consult, we're very strong advocates for safe schools. And some of the products that we showed you we highlighted as investing for organic growth on our quarterly calls are directed right there. And they've hit a sweet spot in the market. We're happy with them. We think they add value to faculty and teachers. And I think that is a vertical, critically important to our mission, but also has the tailwinds of pretty strong muni bond issuance here in this calendar year. Unidentified Analyst : Perfect. Thanks, everybody. John Stone : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The next question is from Robert Schultz with Baird. Please go ahead. Robert Schultz : Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. Maybe first off here, your commentary on spec activity seems to be slightly more positive than your largest competitor. But within institutional, they called out seeing some more weakness in the healthcare verticals. Are you seeing any weakness there? And how would you describe any possible share gains over the past nine months? John Stone : That's appreciate the question. And I think, first off, we don't give really specific detail on spec activity. It's just it's just not, yeah, not details. We don't disclose. But I would just at a high level say, our spec activity is in line with the overall macro commentary we've given you. In terms of our largest competitor, look, they're a great company. They have great products. They keep us on our toes. They're tough to compete with. I think consistent with past quarters, any share gain that's happened out there has probably been at the expense of short line suppliers in the market, who might have found some opportunity when we had supply chain problems. But overall, we feel good about the institutional verticals as a whole and continue to see institutional leading the way in the near term. Robert Schultz : Got it. Thanks. And then maybe on M&A, with thoughts, does that help any specific vertical? And then maybe more broadly on M&A, I think you guys, correct me if I'm wrong here, but have done about five deals year-to-date. How do you think about the pipeline in the '25 and the cadence there? Do you see that playing out at a similar level to 2024? Or any incremental thoughts there would be appreciated. John Stone : Yeah, I appreciate that. And yeah, we're very excited about the SOSS acquisition. It's a great team. It's a great product line. It's perfectly complementary to a business unit that we already have. So really nice add to the business that will help our customers. And this is products that primarily serve the non-residential markets here in the Americas, with some smaller amount of the sales in Asia Pacific. I would say overall, we feel really excited about the pipeline that we're looking at. I would still feel consistent with past quarter commentary. The M&A environment is definitely better than it was for strategics in '22, '23. And again, excited about the pipeline. We have some good momentum going this year, as you mentioned. And I would say, as we look forward, the objective won't be to pile up cash on the balance sheet. We will deploy it in the best interest of our shareholders. So as that means accretive acquisitions, you can look for us to continue to be disciplined like we have been. And when that means repurchase, we will do that at the right time too. Robert Schultz : Awesome. Appreciate the color. Thanks, guys. John Stone : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Stone, President and CEO, for any closing remarks. John Stone : Thanks very much. Thanks everyone for attending the call today. Again, Allegion stable markets, strong execution by a great team, united by a mission of making the world safer and more accessible. And now, we look forward to connecting with you again in Q4. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Goodbye.",
