[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. And now I will introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, you may begin. Steve Austenfeld : Great. Thank you. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining Clorox's first quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Don Knauss, Clorox's Chairman and CEO; and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for 7 days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com. Let me remind you that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt-to-EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today\u2019s press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website, as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today\u2019s earnings release. Please recognize that today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. With that, I'll now cover highlights of our first quarter business performance by segment. Steve will then address our financial results and an updated outlook for fiscal year '14. Finally, Don will close with his perspective on the business, followed by Q&A. In the first quarter, volume was up 1% versus the year-ago period, with increases in Professional Products, Charcoal, Laundry and Burt's Bees, partially offset by declines in Home Care. Sales were up 2%, with increases in 3 of our 4 reportable segments. As we discussed with you on our last earnings call, we anticipated that sales would be -- in the first half of the year, would be lower -- at the lower end of our full-year range due to competitive activity and declining foreign currencies. And our first quarter sales were 2%, well in line with that expectation. Importantly, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales increased 3.5%. Our U.S. market share results reflect a decline of 30 basis points versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting heightened competitive activity as noted last quarter. Over the same period, our categories grew about 1.2 points, with strong gains in Laundry, Charcoal and Cat Litter. Burt's Bees, which is not included in the traditional market share data, also grew share in the quarter. Now let me turn to our first quarter segment results. Our Cleaning segment volume was flat, with sales growth of about 1%. Strong sales in Professional Products due to double-digit gains in our commercial Food, Cleaning and Healthcare businesses. Volume in our Laundry business was also strong, as the category have seen nice growth following the concentration of bleach taking place over the last 18 months. Concentrated bleach is also continuing to deliver significant gross margin improvement from reduced raw material and transportation costs. Although category growth has been strong, our market share remains challenged by the strong merchandising and the distribution of private label bleach at a few customers. We believe increased in-store merchandising, continued benefits from our Bleachable Moments marketing campaign, as well as new advertising noting the significant benefits of Clorox Bleach versus the competition, would improve share trends in the second half of the fiscal year. Partially offsetting the strong results in Professional Products and Laundry was a decline in our Home Care business due to an extremely competitive environment in the Wipes category. And in response, we then increased merchandising support, which will benefit the second half of the fiscal year. And we're expanding Wipes to new uses with new Clorox glass wipes and bath wipes, both of which will begin shipping in January. In our Household segment, volume grew 2%, while sales increased 5%. The segment's top line results were primarily driven by our Kingsford charcoal business. Following 2 quarters of soft consumption, largely due to poor weather, this business rebounded in the first quarter with a double-digit volume increase on a strong summer holiday merchandising and new late-season marketing launched in September, where they can tailgating at home with the fall football season. Our Cat Litter business also contributed volume and sales gains, with the recent launch of our new Clean By Nature product, which uses both carbon and plant extracts to provide strong odor control. Our Lifestyle segment enjoyed 4% volume growth and 5% sales growth. Burt's Bees delivered double-digit volume growth, with a strong growth in the drug channel, our new lip and face care products, supported by strong demand creation. In January, Burt's Bees began shipping new brightening products in the United States, as well as new facial towelettes. Our Food business had its fifth consecutive quarter of higher volume, driven by increased shipments in dry dips and dressings, as well as the sandwich spreads and pasta salad kits launched late last fiscal year. In aggregate, our 3 U.S. segments delivered volume growth of 2% and sales growth of 3% in the face of a sluggish economy and a heightened competitive environment. Turning to our International segment, Q1 volume was flat and sales declined 3%, with strong currency neutral sales, more than offset by foreign currency declines in Argentina, Australia and Canada. Excluding more than 7 percentage points of negative foreign currency impact, International sales growth was more than 4%. Volume in Venezuela and Argentina was down in the quarter, as expected. In other markets, we're investing behind information, such as with our new Cleaning utensils and thick bleach products. And as discussed at our recent Analyst Meeting, we'll continue to invest behind faster growing markets, while prudently managing through the more challenged markets of Venezuela and Argentina. Looking at the full fiscal year, we narrowed our sales growth range to 2% to 3%, factoring in an updated outlook for the impact of foreign currency declines, which are now expected to reduce sales by up to 2 points. Volume is expected to improve in the second half of the fiscal year behind increased merchandising and innovation, as well as an easier prior year shipment comparison, particularly, in our Charcoal business. With that, I'll turn it over to Steve Robb. Stephen M. Robb: Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We're off to a strong start in the fiscal year. Excluding foreign currency headwinds of nearly 2%, we delivered 3.5% sales growth. We also delivered 7% pretax profit growth, as well as free cash flow of $152 million or 11% of net sales, which is about flat versus the year-ago quarter. With that, I'll take you through the details of our Q1 financial results and then discuss our outlook for fiscal '14. In our first quarter, sales increased 2%, reflecting more than 1 point of shipment growth, about 2 points of pricing benefit and nearly 1 point of favorable mix. These factors were partially offset by nearly 2 points of foreign currency declines. Gross margin for the current quarter was essentially flat, which was slightly better than we had anticipated. Importantly, our U.S. gross margin was up versus a year ago, while International margin was down but better than expected. We're pleased that we're starting to see the results from our efforts to cut costs and improve operational efficiencies in our International business, which helped moderate the margin decline. For the quarter, we delivered cost savings of $25 million or 180 basis points and about 80 basis points from pricing. These benefits were offset by higher manufacturing and logistics costs, largely from continued inflation in Latin America and higher commodity costs. Selling and administrative expense for the first quarter was 14.5% of sales, a slight improvement versus the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by lapping prior infrastructure-related investments. These results were partially offset by investments in systems to support the long-term growth of our Burt's Bees business. Advertising spending for the current quarter was nearly 9% of sales. Our U.S. Retail spending was about 10% of sales, reflecting continued support for our domestic brands and categories. We continue to spend prudently in our International business, where we significantly reduced investments in markets with challenging economic environments, while supporting other fast-growing markets, particularly behind innovation. Our tax rate of roughly 34% on earnings from continuing operations was nearly 3 percentage points higher versus the year-ago quarter, reducing diluted earnings per share by about $0.04. As I mentioned, free cash flow for the first quarter was $152 million or 11% of sales, about flat versus the year-ago period, reflecting higher tax payments and an increase in inventory, offset by lower capital expenditures. For the full fiscal year, we continue to anticipate free cash flow to be about 10% of sales. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as cash provided by continuing operations, less capital expenditures. Consistent with our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, we repurchased about 1.6 million shares for $130 million in the first quarter. We ended the quarter with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.1x, at the low end of our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x. Net of all of the factors I've discussed today, in the first quarter, we delivered diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.04, an increase of 3% versus the first quarter of fiscal '13. Now I'll turn to our fiscal 2014 outlook. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we've been closely monitoring foreign currencies and commodities. Coming into the fiscal year, we faced unfavorable foreign exchange headwinds in multiple countries and oil prices that were above our targeted range of $90 to $100 per barrel. Despite the recent fall-off in oil prices, resin prices continued to increase. Given these elevated pressures on sales and earnings, we've updated our full year outlook. As Steve mentioned, we now anticipate sales growth in the range of 2% to 3%, which reflects up to 2 points of impact from foreign currency declines versus a previous assumption of 1 point. In particular, we're facing weaker currencies in Argentina, Australia and Canada. Turning to gross margin. We now anticipate gross margin for the full fiscal year to be flat to slightly down, reflecting higher commodity costs, primarily from resin. All other assumptions about gross margin are generally the same, including the anticipated benefit of 150 basis points from cost savings, some modest pricing and about 100 basis points of negative impact from inflation impacting manufacturing and logistics costs. As we've faced -- done in the past, when we faced elevated commodity costs, we'll consider taking pricing, particularly on products impacted by higher resin costs to support the long-term health of our margins. Our updated EBIT margin range is now flat to up 25 basis points, reflecting more than 100 basis points of negative impact from higher commodity costs. Our previous assumption for commodities was an impact of 100 basis points or less. This range continues to reflect lower selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales, consistent with our long-term goal of reducing this line item to 14% or less of sales. Now due to the timing of spending, we continue to anticipate expenses, as a percentage of sales, to be higher in the first half of the fiscal year. We anticipate total company advertising spending for the full year to be about 9% of sales, or somewhat below, driven largely by our decision to reduce investments in Venezuela and Argentina. The company's outlook continues to reflect $0.05 to $0.10 of diluted earnings per share impact related to the anticipated effects of continued price controls and high inflation in Argentina and Venezuela. As a reminder, our outlook does not assume further devaluation of Venezuela's currency in fiscal '14. Net of all these factors, we now anticipate diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.45 to $4.60 for fiscal '14. Of this $0.10 reduction versus our previous range, about half reflects unfavorable foreign exchange and the balance reflects higher commodity costs net of the mitigating actions we're taking. In closing, we had a strong start to the fiscal year, delivering solid sales and profit growth in the first quarter, masked a bit by a higher tax rate and foreign currency declines. As I mentioned in the press release, we feel good about the plans we have in place to impact the headwinds we're facing and support the long-term health of our business, including a robust product innovation pipeline and strong cost savings. And with that, I'll turn it over to Don. Donald R. Knauss: Okay. Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone on the call. So I certainly believe, as well, that we're off to a good start this fiscal year, with the solid sales and profit growth that Steve mentioned even in the face of these unfavorable foreign currencies, somewhat more than we had anticipated coming into the year. But recall that our outlook was formed about 6 months ago when the dollar was quite a bit weaker than it is today. Now much of our business is performing well, as you heard from Steve's discussion of double-digit volume growth in Professional Products and Charcoal, strong gains in Laundry and a double-digit volume increase in Burt's Bees. Now in total, for the U.S., volume was up over 1.5% and sales were up nearly 3.25% for the quarter. So in addition, we continue to drive efficiencies across the company, delivering that 180 basis points of cost savings that Steve mentioned that benefited gross margin in Q1. That said, we certainly do continue to face heightened competitive activity and we have updated our outlook to reflect 2 significant changes : that greater impact from unfavorable foreign currency; and, of course, the larger impact from increasing commodity costs. Now to mitigate those 2 items, we're taking several actions. First, we are leaning in to deliver strong cost savings for the year. I really feel confident about our cost savings pipeline for the balance of the year. As Steve noted, we anticipate a benefit to gross margin of about 150 basis points from cost savings for the year and we certainly exceeded that target in Q1. Now second, we'll consider taking pricing on products impacted by higher input cost. Now over time, I think we've proven that our brands have the ability to take pricing. And we've found our pricing models to be very predictive, ultimately recovering short-term volume loss and certainly, building margins. And third -- and I think a number of were out here for our Analyst Meeting earlier in the month, that we're really pushing innovation with new products being launched in nearly every business in the second half of the fiscal year. So I would say, the innovation pipeline is strong and I'm really confident in our target to achieve 3 points of sales growth from innovation this fiscal year. So now -- so I would say, more than ever now, we really need to support our brands and partner effectively with retailers to bring excitement into their stores -- they're all hungering for traffic -- and to grow our categories. And as we discussed at our Analyst Day earlier in the month, we have stepped up merchandising plans as well. You're going to see that in the second half of the year. They're also going to see new national advertising campaigns that heavily focus on value and influence our campaigns as well. So to sum up, the fundamentals of our business are strong. I think you saw that through the quarter. And we make more money for our investors by doing 3 basic things : first, selling more volume. We achieved volume growth in our U.S. business, as well as flat volume in International despite issues in Venezuela and Argentina. Second, getting more price realization for our products. We achieved 80 basis points of positive pricing impact for the quarter in gross margin. And third, delivering strong cost savings. And again, we exceeded that 150 basis target and delivered 180 basis points of cost savings in the quarter, which helped keep our gross margins flat. And in fact, in the U.S., as Steve said, our gross margins were up modestly despite the fact that we did absorb higher commodity costs versus the year-ago quarter. And as we've reiterated, the pipeline of cost savings looks solid for the rest of the year. So the fundamentals are strong and we're taking the needed actions I mentioned earlier to offset the issues we're facing with foreign currencies and commodities. We're also committed to regaining market share and I feel very good about our marketing plans and the product innovation across our portfolio as we move into the second half of the year to drive improved share results in the second half of the year. So with that, why don't we open it up to your questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Can you just talk a little bit about, first, Cat Litter and then on the Wipes business? Because it seems like Cat Litter is starting to turn. I'm wondering what you guys did to get the market share stabilizing again? Because I guess, it was competitive from that, say, in that category. And then, obviously, as you kind of entered the new year, it was a really elevated cold and flu season and you had a lot of Wipes volume. So what's the plan to offset that? Donald R. Knauss: Yes. Let me start, Bill. On Litter, I think it's a combination of things. It's clearly getting new innovation out there. Steve referenced some of that earlier, getting new points of distribution has certainly helped. But we're also getting more aggressive on the merchandising. And thirdly, I think you're going to see -- before the end of the year, you'll see new value-focused, product performance-focused advertising. So I think it's -- clearly, right now, it's the distribution gains and the innovation that's driving. And I think we'll combine that, as I said, with this new advertising starting soon. On Wipes, clearly, as we head into the second half of the year, as you noted, we've got significant overlaps in this quarter, given the strong flu season that was prevalent last year. So far, we're seeing good start off, but we've got increased merchandising coming in the next half of the fiscal year. We've got new innovation. I think you -- most of you saw it out in Pleasanton, the glass wipes and the tub and shower wipes, as we've pushed the product into more usage occasions. You're also going to see more value packs, extended value packs, from us as we move into the new year, grouping more canisters, if you will, into multipacks. So we feel pretty good about it as we move into the second half on Wipes as well. And of course, the value advertising, you started to see that kicked off already in this quarter with the guillotine execution, if you will, where we disinfect twice as much as some of our competitors do. So that's a combination of all those elements. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Great. And then, maybe you don't want to venture to guess, but what are your thoughts on the Venezuelan devaluation in January? Because our guys think it's like a 40% chance, so I'm just -- you guys are obviously in the market. So what's your current take in there? I know it's not in the guidance. Stephen M. Robb: Yes, Bill. This is Steve. I think the truth is nobody knows. I mean, what we do know is the official rate is sitting right around 6.3, obviously. If you look at CCEM [ph], which is the mechanism that they've put in place when they've had periodic auctions there, I mean, that's sitting at 11. And by the way, the parallel rate, as of this morning, I think was like 55. So pretty big spread. I think there's no doubt that there's going to be a devaluation. Everything we've heard from the experts is they think it's going to happen sometime next calendar year, probably, in the first of the calendar year. But beyond that, it's really hard to say. I think the government is trying to slow down in terms of how fast they do that for a variety of reasons. But when you've got a parallel rate that's sitting in almost 55 relative to the official rate, it's not whether there's going to be a devaluation it's just how much and when. And I think that's what we're all monitoring closely. Donald R. Knauss: The intelligence we have, Bill, is not fundamentally different from what you said. Operator : Our next question will come from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Just a follow-up on that. I know your $0.05 to $0.10 full year EPS impact from Venezuela and Argentina. Is that kind of pro rata? So the impact of those 2 countries in this quarter is kind of $0.02 to $0.03? Stephen M. Robb: Yes, that's pretty close. And I think what we've said is the $0.05 to $0.10 still feels right to us to pick up the operating challenges we have. A little more of that's likely to fall in first half than the second half, but your estimate for the first quarter is pretty close. Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. And then my bigger picture question. Two things. First of all, can you comment on sort of the innovation pipeline? I know Wipes launched in January, on just the timing of other sort of new product activity. Because my question really is, you've got a really tough volume comp in the December quarter and I'm thinking, in Wipes in particular, maybe you've got destocking before the new launch. So do you think volumes are going to be up or down on -- in the second quarter? Donald R. Knauss: Yes, Wendy, I think the second quarter will be the toughest one from a volume overlap. Obviously, we had 8.5% revenue growth in that quarter, as you pointed out, and 5% volume growth. So that will be the most challenging. The new product cadence is, obviously, these launches and you saw a number of them when you were out. These launches will begin in January. So if you look at Home Care, for example, in addition to the Wipes we talked about, you've got Pine-Sol innovation with the floor Wipes, the Squirt & Mop Pine-Sol. We've got new bleach items coming out, King Size Scents. We've got the Fraganzia line of bleach. We've got Smart seeking bleach, which you all saw. So -- and we've got new flavors on Hidden Valley, et cetera. So if you go down the major brand list, all of that is hitting in the January, early February timing. So we're going to see some load of that as we get into the December time frame, as people load up on that. So that should help mitigate a little bit, but clearly, the second quarter will be the challenge on the volume cycle. Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : And is there a generalization that you could make about the innovations? I mean, I know, most of the companies in the group, when they launch new products, they like to make them premium-priced because they're more innovated and they offer value-added benefits. It sounds like, on the one hand, you should be up-charging for them because they're new and special and the commodity environment is difficult. On the other hand, you got all this competitive activity. So can you generalize and say is this stuff premium-priced? Or is it coming out at the same prices as the stuff that it's replacing? Donald R. Knauss: By and large, if it's Wipes, for example, the glass and tub and shower wipes, it's more aligned with the standard wipe pricing. If you look at things like Pine-Sol floor wipes and Squirt & Mop and some of the new executions or new products on Brita, for example, and on Glad, with the new Hawaiian Aloha Scent, it's more of a premium price and more of a trade-up. What you're also going to see, though, in that quarter is a step-up in merchandising to support those new items, so that -- so we get off to a fast start. But by and large, I would say over half of the innovation we're doing is a margin enhancement to the company average. Operator : Moving on to Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I just want to -- two questions. First, what's your updated expectation on crude versus the $90 to $100 that you had before? And then on cost cutting, clearly, it looks like you saw a little bit more of an improvement than you had expected. So was there just an overage across the board? Or is there a specific project that came in better than you expected? Stephen M. Robb: Yes, so this is Steve, let me lead off. So from a crude oil standpoint, our latest assumption is that oil will trade in the range of $95 to $105. Although, as I say that, the one thing I always want to remind folks, that a lot of the markets that we're buying commodities, things like resin, they trade as much on supply and demand as they do crude oil and nat gas and these other things. But $95 to $105 is what we're assuming. As far as cost savings, we got off to a pretty quick start. We hit 180 basis points of cost savings, as I mentioned, in the first quarter. A lot of that was being driven by the new bleach, the concentrated bleach, and that has really been delivering pretty significant results for us in the P&L and we're certainly seeing that come through cost savings. In fact, we remain -- we're still targeting the 150 basis points of margin expansion from the cost savings programs. But this is one of the things we'll be leaning into to try to mitigate some of the higher commodity costs that, obviously, we're seeing in the form of resin. So we feel good about the pipeline and the programs and our ability to help mitigate at least some of the higher commodity costs this year and, certainly, over the longer term. Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Got it. But still too early to update the cost savings target at this point? Stephen M. Robb: We're going to hold with the 150 basis points. That's our long-term target. And again, our goal is always to try to hit that and try to beat it when we can. But we'd also say that when you have a 3-year pipeline of ideas that constantly pursuing, we're focused on steady, solid execution of the projects we have as opposed to trying to spike it in one quarter or another, which is very hard to do, given how we run the programs. Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Got it. And then just a follow-up on Professional Products. You guys talked a little bit about that at the Analyst Day and maybe if you can give us an update on how the acquisition environment looks there. Because you've talked about how you want to grow both organically and inorganically in that market, but haven't heard much in terms of acquisitions more recently. Stephen M. Robb: Yes. And again, we had done 3 acquisitions in the space over a couple of years. What I would say is we've got a robust pipeline of companies that we're always looking at and that we're interested in. It's really hard to do call the timing of these but I feel good about the pipeline, I feel good about our ability over the next 3 to 5 years to get some additional bolt-on acquisitions in that space. But you have to kind of work these 3 over time and it does take a little time. So very hard to predict. But again, good, healthy pipeline. Feel good about our prospects for the future. Donald R. Knauss: The one thing I would add, Olivia, on that, is that when we put our algorithm together to get the Healthcare business from the $130 million it is today roughly to $300 million, we thought we needed about $100 million of additional bolt-ons over the next 3 years. That's come down to $60 million because of the strength in the organic growth of what we have acquired and integrated. So it takes some of the pressure off us, but as Steve said, we've got a pretty robust pipeline there. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Steib with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Michael Steib - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I have 2 questions, please. Do you know when you're likely to be back on the normal merchandising cycle for bleach? Is that still expected for early the third quarter? That's my first question. And then secondly, could you give us a bit more detail on why the margins in the Lifestyle segment were down 250 basis points? Is that all related to the investments behind the Burt's Bees launches? Donald R. Knauss: Yes, let me start, Michael, on the bleach. And I'll turn it to Steve and he can talk on the second part -- the second question you had. We're already starting to see the bleach improving. We're starting to see improved consumption trends as we move into this quarter. I think, to your point, the bulk of the merchandising improvements we'll see as we move into the second half of the fiscal year, particularly as we get some of the new items moving out, like the new King Lavender Scent or the new King Scents we're putting out, the Fraganzia bleach we're putting out and then Smart seeking bleach. So we're going to align more of that merchandising support behind those new items as we move into January, February. But we're already starting to see some modest improvement right now. Stephen M. Robb: And regarding your question about Lifestyle margins and profitability, it is all due to the investments we're making in systems. Essentially, Burt's Bees, as we've talked before, this is business is growing double digits, fast-growing. It's expected to continue to grow pretty fast. We've simply outgrown the systems that we have in the business when we acquired it. So we're in the process of investing to move them onto our U.S. SAP platform. Good news is, we turned the system on in October, it's going extremely well. And we think that you're going to continue to see costs come through that segment for another quarter or 2. But after that, we should start to anniversary that and you'll see the profitability come right back. Operator : Ali Dibadj with Bernstein has the next question. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Just, first off, a quick clarification on the $0.10 you've guided down for the year. What would have that -- what would have that have been without the tax improvement? And also, are you -- is there a different amount of contingency for Venezuela in the number going forward versus what you've said before? Stephen M. Robb: Okay. Let me start with the tax piece. There's been no fundamental shift. I mean, we're seeing tax rates of about 34%, okay? So I really wouldn't attribute it to any of that. It really is what I said in my opening comments, which is, about $0.05 is related to the foreign currencies. The previous estimate we had for foreign currencies was down about 6 months ago, so things have obviously shifted. And then, the other $0.05, really, is this higher commodity costs, net of all of the mitigating actions that we're taking to offset it. As far as Venezuela, again, as I said, that we're continuing to use the official exchange rate like everyone else, of 6.3. And we really haven't made any changes in our outlook for Venezuela either in terms of devaluation or the operating climate, notwithstanding that we did a little bit better in the first quarter than we had expected there. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Okay. And then from a mitigating perspective on commodities, can you give us a sense of how much of the commodity costs, what percentage you expect to be able to offset? And whether you think that's different today given some of the share pressures and competition and retailer pressures that are out there right now? Stephen M. Robb: I think long term, we feel very good about being able to mitigate this and protect our margins. Again, we took a pretty sharp increase in resin in September. So within any given fiscal year, it can be a challenge to offset 100% of this. But certainly, over the long term, we feel very good. And the actions, as I mentioned earlier, that we're taking, we're going to take a hard look at pricing, primarily, international pricing, where we think we have some opportunity. Cost savings certainly came in strong for the first quarter and that's an area that we're going to continue to lean into. And then, of course, SG&A. So I think we're going to do what we do well, which is focus on the fundamentals and take the right actions. Understand the share challenges, but we fundamentally believe that these brands have pricing power. We've seen that over the long term and remain fairly confident that we can recover any margin pressures from commodities over the long-term, doing the things that we do well. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Okay. And my last one, I just want to dig in a little bit into innovation. From a pricing power perspective, certainly, some of the ways you do that is through innovation. And just trying to get a better understanding of really how you think about the ROI on innovation, not much in your R&D process in terms of how you think about it philosophically going forward. Because we keep hearing it drives about 3% of incremental top line growth, which is great, but it feels like that then drops off, right? So you're only growing 3%. So you get 1%, you're out of it and it drops off. You have to start from scratch again. And I'm trying to understand from a longer-term perspective, how to square that, how to understand that. And whether from a pricing perspective, it's a necessity or are you gaining more shelf space? Do you get a sense of shelf space changes around, I think, from these innovations in the short-term? I'm trying to kind of put it all together to understand -- you're investing, you've got 3%. It disappears. You have to invest again to get another 3%. Donald R. Knauss: Let me take a shot at this, Ali, and then we can certainly have an off-line conversation about this. It might take longer to get into it. But I think you and I talked about this a little bit at the Analyst Day. If you take the innovation that drives the 3 points of growth, let's take the SMART TUBE technology on spray cleaners. It's not like the 3 points of growth is coming from completely new products. It's coming across a broad range of our existing products. So for example, that SMART TUBE technology on our spray cleaners is an innovation that's counted in that 3% growth. Obviously, it's manifested on Tilex, on 409, et cetera. We're not counting those brands as new, if you will. So a lot of this investment and, certainly, the 9.9% advertising and consumer promotion we're spending in the U.S., is dedicated to reinforcing those innovations. So it's not like we start over every year, I guess. I guess that's where I'm struggling a bit. Because we -- the innovation, a lot of times, is across the base legacy brands. Stephen M. Robb: Ali, this is Steve. I'd make a couple of other points. Number one, just for clarity, the 3 percentage points that we talked about from incremental sales, that's net of cannibalization, okay? Second, in our internal financial hurdles, we're always focused on long-term, incremental sales associated with consumer-meaningful innovations. So it's not like this stuff is launching and disappearing. I mean, we try to focus on consumer-meaningful innovation that has staying power. And ideally, it's margin accretive. As a minimum, we like it to be net neutral to an SBU, but we really do target to make it margin accretive, because that creates a fuel for growth to be able to invest more behind the brand. So the stuff does have staying power. It's certainly what we've been seeing in all the work that we've been doing. Donald R. Knauss: And I think to pile on -- with his comment, as he said, once you launch and you get to 3 points of growth, use the words, that it drops off in a year or 2. It actually is built into our base at that point. So we're still typically getting incremental growth out of the items we launched the prior year or the year before that. It's just we're no longer counting them as part of the 3 points. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : And what about... Donald R. Knauss: So they're dropping off. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : That's helpful. And what about shelf space? Do you incrementally get shelf space every time? Donald R. Knauss: Yes, we've seen -- yes, obviously, it depends on the category, Ali. But we've seen no real loss on shelf space at all, but net gains on assortment. I think one of the issues we've had, for example, on Bleach is -- the issue on Bleach, for example, in terms of our share loss, hasn't been that we've been getting less distribution gains than private label, but that the productivity of their gains was better. So for example, if you look at the Bleach share we've lost -- and we think that's why we're more confident and the second half we'll start to reverse this -- if you look at where private label has really driven growth in Bleach, it's through scented kings, where they really had no innovation and no presence. And we had that. And so the -- those are more mainstream items. We rolled out things like Gentle Bleach. And while we've got distribution gains and assortment gains, if you will, from shelf space for that, it didn't have the productivity or velocity that a Lavender King Size private label bleach had. So it's not just are you getting the assortment gain in the shelf space. It is, is the productivity of that SKU what you thought it was. And so if you look at the Bleach innovation coming out, for example, the kings, we're starting to plus out the scents because that's where the growth is really being driven. So it's -- we tend to get shelf space. We tend to get more distribution points. What we're trying to do is make sure the efficacy of those distribution points is as solid as it can be. Operator : And Erin Lash with Morningstar has the next question. Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : I just wanted to ask about the Hidden Valley business. Obviously, you cited that, that business continues to do well. Kraft's noted last night that their salad dressing business continues to be ultra competitive. And so I kind of wanted to get your thoughts on the overall category. Donald R. Knauss: Erin, you cut out. I couldn't quite hear. Erin, did you say -- I couldn't quite hear it, Erin. Stephen M. Robb: Erin did you say that the dressing category has been ultra competitive? Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Yes, Kraft has noted that the salad dressing business has been ultra competitive. Donald R. Knauss: Yes, if you look at the category trends on salad dressing, the last 13 weeks, the category has been down about 0.5. We've ticked up our share about 0.1. If you look at the last 4 weeks, the category has rebounded a little bit. You never put much into a 4-week number. But the category has been fairly solid over the last year or 18 months. And I think our -- the constant flow of innovation we've had on at Hidden Valley, like with Farm fresh, has really helped drive our share position in that category and helped drive the category growth. So I think a lot of it has been due to our innovation. The interesting thing about Hidden Valley is, as we expand that franchise into adjacencies like pasta salads, sandwich spreads, et cetera, I think it actually helps drive our salad dressing businesses well. It just gets the brand out there front and center into more occasions. And I think that's one of the things that's helped us really gain fairly significant share over the last 3 years. Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : That's very helpful. And I apologize if I missed this, but if you could just speak to the consumer spending environment and what you're seeing with regards to consumer attitude with spending? Donald R. Knauss: Yes, the interesting thing is we, obviously, have all talked about the fragile consumer for the last few years. If you look the last 13 weeks in our total categories, they're up 1.2%. If you look at the last month, categories are up about 1.4%. If you go back to fiscal -- calendar year '12, our categories were up about 1.5%. So we're getting back to the historical range of growth in these categories, which is about 1% to 2%. We did have a dip in the first 6 months of this calendar year, in '13, where we kind of went flattish, but we're starting to see the categories come back a little bit north of 1%. So that -- we think that bodes well, that we're at least getting back into the historical range. Operator : We'll now hear from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Two things. So first, this is on Brita. So I think the business has probably slowed down this quarter. If you could talk a little bit about that. I apologize, I don't remember if the hard-sided bottle, has it formally launched yet or if that was still to come. And then, the second thing was just anything you could offer in terms of the retail inventory environment. We've kind of heard a -- I think a very mixed bag of perspectives on what's going on in terms of how closely you're managing your inventory. So just to get a sense of what you guys are seeing. Donald R. Knauss: Yes, let me start, Lauren, and then maybe Steve will want to jump in. I think on Brita, we saw a little bit of a volume loss, not much in the quarter, but we did see some sales growth again. And we're starting to see some share gain again. If you look at the last 4 weeks, we've seen a little bit of share gain as the category rebounds a bit. This is a category, if you look at the last 13 weeks, where Filtration has been down almost 3%. If you look at the last month, it's actually been up a little bit, about almost 1%. It's a category for the last year or 18 months that's been under a lot of pressure from bottled water as these guys really go deep on pricing. I think we're fairly pleased with the innovation. The kids' bottles have done okay, not -- they haven't blown the doors off, but they've certainly done okay. If you look at what's coming in January with -- we've got more prints coming out. We've got the universal filter coming out. We've got a hard-sided 34-ounce Brita on-the-go bottle, if you will. And we've also got the Hello Kitty bottle for kids coming out. So there's a lot of news coming on that business. So we feel fairly bullish coming into the second half of the fiscal year. It's probably the strongest innovation pipeline we've had on Brita for a while. Stephen M. Robb: And Lauren, I'd just add on the bottle segment of Water Filtration, which is the fastest-growing segment, we have a market share that's even higher than our broader business, which, as you know, is pretty healthy. So we feel pretty good about that. Donald R. Knauss: Yes, that share is approaching 70 or north thereof, so we do feel pretty good about that. That's one of those things. So that business, Lauren, to us, is more of an image business than, obviously, what you'd put in your refrigerator. So it's going to -- it takes constant innovation around design. And that's what we're focused on, is having a cadence of innovation on the bottle business that keeps it on the forefront of people's mind from an image standpoint, design standpoint. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division : And is the hard-sided bottle just launching in that, let's say, the adult size, but not yet kids? Is that right? Donald R. Knauss: No. Kids was launched, basically, with the back-to-school season this year. So in the last few months. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Is it the hard-sided bottle or the soft one? Donald R. Knauss: The hard-sided. That was the one, when you were out for our Analyst Day, you may have seen. We had a number of different Nickelodeon-type characters on it. Yes, that was Dora the Explorer. And the Hello Kitty version is coming in January. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. Got it. And then just the Retail inventory trends would be great, too. Stephen M. Robb: I think as we said in the last Analyst Day from a retailer inventory, there's always going to be adjustments in the retail environment. But our categories tend to be very fast-moving off-shelf. We tend to tightly control the inventories in partnership with our retailers. So it can have a little bit of a noise in the quarter but it hasn't been meaningful for us, I would say. Donald R. Knauss: Yes, that one has, certainly, not been meaningful to us. Operator : Moving on to Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets. Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: My question has been answered. Operator : In that case, we'll move on to Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : I wanted bring it back to Venezuela for a second. Can you just talk about your view on price controls, right? So -- and in the event of another devaluation. So do you have any idea how that's going to go if you're going to get more flexibility around the ability to price, if you do see a substantial devaluation there? Stephen M. Robb: It's really hard to know. Historically, if you look at countries with price controls, including Venezuela, usually following a devaluation -- although this can lag some time, generally, there's this some kind of relaxation on the price controls because ultimately, what they're trying to do is get more product on-shelf that's both domestically produced, as well as important products. It's the scarcity on-shelf that they're trying to fix by making some of these changes. So I think it's a fairly decent presumption that if there's a devaluation at some point, price controls will be relaxed at least somewhat and you'll be able to get some pricing through. But that's a pretty unusual market there and we'll just have to wait and see. Donald R. Knauss: Chris, I was down in Colombia, Peru and Argentina about 3 weeks ago. And I think, certainly, one of the things we're doing in Argentina, is innovating, being fully aware of where the price controls are and how we innovate to get around some of those price controls with different products that the government says is okay. I think having said that, we are getting more positive signs from the government post the congressional elections of this month, that they may be more open to pricing. We'll see how that plays out. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Got it. And just totally unrelated, can you just remind me again of, like, the latest and greatest on how you're buying resin? Like, what's your exposure to spot price movements as opposed to forward buys? And also, is Glad still all right -- right where you just kind of feel it right away? I'm just trying to get a sense for the lag on raw materials. Donald R. Knauss: It's a little complicated, but I would say is, we don't do any formal hedging, I'll say that. What we do is, because of just the flow of resin through the cycle, we'll -- we can sometimes lag anywhere between 30 and 90 days depending on the form of resin. Resin blends that we use depends on the product that we're making. We buy HDPE. We buy linear load density polyethylene. So we're buying all the various grades, typically. But the trash bag business, which is the biggest one, uses linear load. Operator : Our next question will come from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I wanted to talk about cash flow. This is the second quarter where you've seen a pretty large share repurchase number flow into the cash flow statement. And for the first time in a while, your net debt is actually creeping up. It looks like you leaned on some short-term notes payable to fund some of this. So in that context, can you help us with kind of your current thinking in terms of buyback activity, willingness to take on leverage and what we should expect from you going forward? Stephen M. Robb: Yes. So to your point, we did enter the market and we picked up about 1.6 million shares, spend about $130 million. First, I would just point out that our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was about 2.1x. So we're certainly at the low end of our leverage range. The outlook that we provided today does anticipate that we'll continue to do some level of share repurchases, but probably more to just offset stock option dilution than anything else. I think going forward, what we have committed to, and I think we've got a pretty good track record of doing, is if we're building up excess cash, we look for ways to get that back to shareholders. At this point, the idea of doing a major share repurchase by leveraging up, that is not something that we're contemplating at this point. I think we're comfortable with our leverage ratio, feel very good about the strength of our cash flows. And I think it's safe to say, as we build up cash flow, we'll look for ways to get that back to our shareholders, consistent with past practice. Donald R. Knauss: And Jason, just for clarity, you mentioned, I think your words were, we leaned on leverage a little bit. As Steve noted, we're at 2.1x, prior quarter 2.2x, the quarter before. So a little unclear in terms of what you're referring to. I just wanted to be certain of that. Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Sure. I'm seeing the exact same ratios. I was looking at absolute debt load. Donald R. Knauss: Okay. But we all know is, within our leverage range on the debt-to-EBITDA basis, we've been pretty consistent or flat over the last couple of quarters. Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Yes, yes. It looks clean. I'm not trying to imply anything different than that. Just trying to get a sense of use of cash. Operator : Well, this concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Knauss, I will turn the conference back to you. Donald R. Knauss: Okay. Well, we certainly appreciate everyone's participation. Happy Halloween to all and have a safe one. And we'll speak to you next quarter. Take care. Operator : And again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you, all, for your participation.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, please go ahead sir. Steve Austenfeld : Great, thank you. Welcome everyone, and thank you for joining Clorox's second quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Don Knauss, Clorox's Chairman and CEO and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com. Let me remind you that on today's call, we\u2019ll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt-to-EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today\u2019s press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website, as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today\u2019s earnings release. Please recognize that today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. With that, I'll now cover highlights of our second quarter business performance by segment. Steve will then address our financial results and our updated outlook for fiscal year \u201914. Finally, Don will close with his perspective on the business, followed by Q&A. In the second quarter, volume was up a little more than 1% on top of the strong year ago period when volume increased 5% behind our conversion to concentrated bleach, a very strong cold and flu season and strong early season shipments of Charcoal. Given the very strong top-line performance a year ago, we\u2019re very pleased to have delivered volume growth this quarter. Second quarter volume increases in Professional Products, Home Care and International were partially offset by declines in Charcoal and Brita. Sales for the quarter were up about 0.5 point, with increases in Professional Products, Food and International largely offset by declines in our other businesses. Foreign currency continued to have a meaningful impact on our sales results as the currencies of Argentina, Canada, Australia and several Latin American countries declined meaningfully versus the U.S. dollar. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales increased 2.3%. Our U.S. 13 week market share results reflect a decline of 0.3 points versus the year ago quarter, the same as we reported in the first quarter, reflecting ongoing intense competitive activity. Over the same period, our categories were essentially flat, following an improvement of 0.7 points in the first quarter. Reduced category growth was driven by a higher level of promotion across several categories, declined in Home Care, Glad, and Filtration, essentially offset by solid category growth in Laundry, Cat Litter and Charcoal. Burt\u2019s Bees, which is not included in the traditional market share data also grew share in a growing category during the quarter. Now let me turn to our second quarter segment results. Our Cleaning segment volume grew 3% with sales growth trailing slightly at 2% due to negative mix from consumers purchasing larger sized products, as well as additional trade promotion spending to address competitive pressures. That said, we feel very good about positive sales growth in this segment, recognizing we were lapping a record 15% sales growth in the year ago quarter. Strong double-digit volume growth in Professional Products was driven by gains in our Commercial Cleaning and Health Care businesses. Our Home Care business returned to volume growth, driven by record shipments of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes behind the incremental merchandising plans we discussed with you last quarter. On the innovation front, new Clorox Bath Wipes and Glass Wipes both began shipping in January as we seek to extend Wipes use to new occasions throughout the home. Volume in our Laundry business was flat driven by increased merchandising support partially offset by lower Green Works laundry detergent shipments due to category softness. As expected, the Bleach category is beginning to slow from recent double-digit increases following compaction to single-digit growth today. That said, our 3D demand building plans for Bleach, which we shared with you at our Analyst Day, are beginning to have an impact. With increased in-store merchandising, our Bleachable Moments marketing campaign and new advertising noting the significant benefits of Clorox Bleach versus the competition, our market share trends are improving, moving from about a 57% share in the first half to approaching 60% in December. Concentrated bleach also continues to deliver significant gross margin improvement from reduced raw material and transportation cost. Looking ahead for the Cleaning division, in addition to the new Bath and Glass Wipes I just mentioned, we have a number of other new products launching in the second half, including our new Smart Seek Bleach which began shipping yesterday. Smart Seek Bleach is a breakthrough innovation that whitens white and mostly white clothing without effecting colors. Also last month we began shipping Clorox Fraganzia Bleach. These highly fragranced bleach products are designed to appeal to and attract new consumers particularly in the Hispanic population. In our Household segment volume and sales each declined 1%. The segment\u2019s top-line results were largely driven by declines in our Charcoal business as we lapped double-digit increases in the year ago quarter. In our Cat Litter business volume was up 1% while sales declined 2% due to increased trade promotion spending. We have plans in place to address the competitive dynamics in Litter overtime with harder hitting advertising and improved packaging, building off recent product improvements that provide our best Odor Control ever. Volume in our Lifestyle segment decreased 1% while sales were flat. Sales outpaced volume due to the benefit of price increases and lower trade promotion spending. Our food business headed sixth consecutive quarter of higher volume, coupled with strong sales growth driven by increased shipments in dry, dips and dressings. Whereas Burt's Bees volume was flat as the brand faced comparison to a high year ago base from the launch of new whipped color products. These results were more than offset by top-line decreases on our Brita business due to declines in Pour-Through Filters in the face of expanded private label distribution. Turning to our International segment, volume increased 2% and sales grew 1%. Sales lagged volume due to currency declines across much of the international business, although pricing and positive mix enabled us to offset much of the foreign currency impact. Excluding the more than 8 percentage points of negative foreign currency impact in the segment, international sales growth would have been about 9%. With that let me comment on two countries that have been in the news a lot lately, Argentina and Venezuela, where the volatility in both countries continues to make it difficult to forecast our International results. In Argentina which represents about 3.5% of Company sales, we continue to experience inflation of 25% or higher but have been able to cover most of that with price increases. Also our second quarter results from Argentina did benefit by comparing against a lower year ago base period when we were in the midst of completing our IT systems implementation there. Although this quarter\u2019s results were better than anticipated, we are closely monitoring the recent currency devaluation in the peso for the impact it would have on our results. In Venezuela, which represents about 2% of Company sales, we also continued to experience very high inflation, at times north of 50% while only having the ability to take pricing due to government controls or non-regulated items which have made up about a third of our portfolio. As a result our Venezuela business is not profitable based on recently reported results. Although we continue to face challenges in these two countries, we\u2019re pleased to have grown the sales and profit in International during the second quarter. We continue to invest in our faster growing markets and have confidence our investment plans will further strengthen results overtime. Looking at the full fiscal year, we have lowered our total Company sales growth outlook to 1% to 2%, factoring in an updated outlook for the impact of foreign currency declines and continued sluggish category growth. Our outlook also continues to include higher year-over-year trade spending to address competitive dynamics. That said on a currency neutral basis, we anticipate sales growth to be 3% to 4% for the fiscal year. In addition, we remain encouraged by our innovation plans as we feel confident in our ability to meet or exceed our annual goal of 3 points of incremental sales from innovation driven by products launched last fall, as well as those coming out in the next month or so. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve Robb. Steve Robb : Thanks Steve and welcome everyone. As Steve mentioned we grew sales on top of a challenging comparison to the year ago quarter and sales increased 9% in the current quarter, scooting the impact of foreign currencies sales were up 2.3%. Turning to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter, the 5% decline compares to a strong 18% growth in the year ago period, which included a gain of $0.03 from the sale lease back of our Oakland headquarters building. Unfavorable foreign currencies also impacted the current quarter results by about $0.05. With that, I\u2019ll take you through the details of our second quarter financial results and then discuss our outlook for fiscal \u201914. In the second quarter, we grew sales about 0.5 percentage point reflecting more than a point of volume growth and about 2 points of pricing benefit. These factors were partially offset by about 2 points of foreign currency declines across multiple countries. Gross margin for the current quarter came in at 41.9%, a decline of 60 basis points. For the quarter we delivered 20 million in cost savings or 150 basis points and about 70 basis points from pricing primarily in international markets. These benefits were offset by nearly 140 basis points of commodity cost primarily from resin, as well as more than 120 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs due to continued high inflation in international markets particularly Venezuela and Argentina. Selling and administrative expense for the second quarter was 15% of sales, a slight improvement versus year ago quarter, primarily driven by lower employee incentive compensation, cost savings and lapping infrastructure-related investments. These results were partially offset by the impact of inflation in international markets and one-time costs associated with the transition to new IT service providers. Advertising spending for the current quarter was more than 9% of sales as expected reflecting increased support for our brands globally with our U.S. retail business spending at about 10% of sales. Our second quarter tax rate of 35.6% on earnings from continuing operations was more than a point higher versus the year ago quarter, reducing diluted earnings per share by $0.02. We continue to anticipate a tax rate of about 34% for the full fiscal year. Net of all of the factors I have discussed today, in the second quarter we delivered diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.88. Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date free cash flow was 149 million versus 223 million in the same period a year ago. This decrease is the result of higher tax payments, as well as the Company\u2019s funding of liabilities under certain non-qualified deferred compensation plans partially offset by lower capital expenditures. We anticipate the higher tax payments in the first half of the fiscal year to be offset by lower tax payments over the balance of the fiscal year. We also continue to anticipate free cash flow as a percentage of net sales to be about 10% of sales for the fiscal year. For the quarter, we ended with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.2 at the low-end of our targeted range of 2 to 2.5. Now I\u2019ll turn to our fiscal year 2014 outlook. As you saw from our press release, we updated our sales and earnings outlook primarily due to the significant 19% devaluation of the Argentine peso in January. As Steve mentioned we now anticipate sales growth to be in the range of 1% to 2%, reflecting more than 2 points of continuing foreign currency declines for the full year and up to 3 points of impact in the second half of the fiscal year. Looking forward, we anticipate further devaluation of the Argentine peso through the remainder of the fiscal year. From perspective of the 1 point decrease in our sales outlook, about half relates to foreign currency headwinds and the balance reflects sluggish U.S. category growth. We are now assuming U.S. category growth rates below the 1% level we had previously factored into our last outlook. Higher year-over-year trade spending in the back half of the fiscal year will also temper sales growth. Turning to gross margin, we anticipate gross margin for the full fiscal year to be down modestly reflecting the margin impact of our updated foreign exchange outlook and slightly stronger commodity cost headwinds. All other assumptions about gross margin remain generally the same, including an anticipated benefit of 150 basis points from cost savings offset by about 100 basis points of negative impact from inflation affecting manufacturing and logistics costs. In the face of elevated commodity costs, we continue to take pricing actions in International where possible to help offset both inflation and foreign currency declines. In addition, we recently announced a price increase of 6% on our Glad trash business to offset the rising cost of resin. This increase will take effect in March of this year. We continue to expect our fiscal year EBIT margin range to be flat to up 25 basis points. This range reflects lower selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales likely about 14% of sales consistent with our long-term goal of reducing this line item. Our fiscal year \u201914 EBIT margin will also benefit from a shift of advertising to trade promotion spending to address competitive promotional activity. Advertising levels will also continue to be impacted by reduced investments in challenged international markets particularly Argentina and Venezuela. As a result, we now expect advertising spending for the full fiscal year to be slightly less than 9% of sales. Importantly our U.S. retail business continues to expect advertising spending to be between 9% and 10% of sales. As we mentioned in our press release, although it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see additional currency devaluations in Venezuela, our fiscal 2014 outlook does not assume further devaluation of the Venezuela currency beyond the February 2013 devaluation. Net of all of these factors, we now anticipate diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.40 to $4.55, for fiscal year \u201914. The $0.05 reduction versus our previous outlook reflects the Company\u2019s new foreign currency exchange assumptions primarily for Argentina. In closing, I feel very good about our overall results for the first half of the fiscal year, particularly our ability to deliver 3% sales growth on a currency neutral basis, this on top of a comparison to strong sales growth in the year ago period. Looking to the second half of the fiscal year, foreign currency headwinds and sluggish category growth will continue to weigh on our results. We\u2019re responding with innovation and more aggressive trade spending, as well as a continued focus on our operational efficiencies. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Don. Don Knauss : Okay, thank you, Steve and hello to everyone on the call. So as I reflect on the quarter, I do think we performed well growing volume and sales on top of a very high year ago base that both Steve\u2019s referenced. And that year ago base of course was really driven by the launch of concentrated bleach and strong innovation pipeline and a double-digit increase in charcoal volume that we had. Importantly, I think it\u2019s good to note that we realized volume gains in 6 out of the 9 U.S. business units and for the total U.S. volume was up 1% on top of very strong results a year ago. So I\u2019m particularly pleased with this quarter\u2019s top-line performance in International, which delivered 2% volume growth and 1% sales growth despite the material foreign currency headwinds we faced. In fact as Steve mentioned on a currency neutral basis, International sales grew 9% in the quarter. Interestingly, the biggest driver of this was Latin America which delivered 4% sales growth overall, but when you back out its 11% FX hit. LATAM for us delivered 15% sales growth on a currency neutral basis, very strong growth. And as mentioned, we have updated our outlook for foreign currency declines and sluggish category growth with sales now expected to grow about 1% to 2% for the year or about 3% to 4% on a currency neutral basis. So as discussed, commodity cost increases particularly in resin and increased manufacturing and logistics cost driven by inflation primarily in international market continue to put pressure on Q2 margins. Now at the same time, we continue to drive efficiencies across the Company and really do remain on-track to achieve our cost savings targets for the fiscal year. We also had success in taking price in some international markets and as Steve noted, have announced a price increase on Glad that we really believe will help offset the rising resin cost. Now we remain highly focused on keeping our core healthy and we\u2019re committed to regaining market share, and I feel very good about our plans across our portfolio and including a strong innovation pipeline in this half of the fiscal year to really drive some improved share results in the second half of the year. We\u2019re particularly pleased with the improving trends for Clorox liquid bleach, for perspective we just received our January share trends and for the month Clorox liquid bleach grew share to two tenths of the share point to 60.7, now that\u2019s our highest share on Clorox liquid bleach in 10 months. So we\u2019re pleased that the programs we put in place are working. In addition, Clorox 2 Color Booster & Stain Fighter grew two tenths of the share point to 27.3. So we\u2019re pleased to see improving health across the two largest brands in our Laundry portfolio. And we expect our investment plans to yield future market share improvements in the second half of the fiscal year. I do think our second quarter results are demonstrating that our 3D demand-building capabilities are gaining traction here. We\u2019re investing and supporting our brands with new merchandizing plans along with national advertising and influence our campaigns and we\u2019re working with our retailer partners to grow our categories. I think as many of you saw in October at the Analyst Day session here, our second half innovation pipeline is strong and with new products being launched in nearly every business and we are on-track to achieve 3 points of sales growth from innovation in the fiscal year consistent with the objective we set. Now looking further out, we do believe the unfavorable foreign exchange rates that are currently impacting sales will stabilize over the long-term. And we continue to anticipate that our U.S. retail categories which grew about a 0.5 in calendar year \u201912 and about another point in calendar year \u201913 will overtime maintain the long-term growth rates of 1% to 2% we\u2019ve projected consistent with population growth in an improving U.S. economy. We also remain very optimistic about our innovation capabilities in the pipeline to deliver an average of 3 points of incremental growth from innovation annually. So with that, let\u2019s go to your questions. Question: and: Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll go first to Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Wendy Nicholson : Hi, I have two questions, if I may. First on, we\u2019ve all heard from Church & Dwight this morning that they\u2019re launching a new OxiClean product sort of directly head-to-head against bleach sort of a bleach alterative. Number one, is that factored into your plans? Number two, do you think you\u2019ll lose shelf space to them? Does that affect your thinking at all? And then just secondarily, Steve, I wanted to go back to the comment you made that manufacturing and logistics cost your gross margin 120 basis points primarily because of the international markets and that just seems like a very large impact on your profitability given how relatively small Venezuela and Argentina are. So I guess the question is, is there anything more you can do to mitigate the margin impact of the devaluation because it just seems like a big number to me? Thanks. Citigroup Research : Hi, I have two questions, if I may. First on, we\u2019ve all heard from Church & Dwight this morning that they\u2019re launching a new OxiClean product sort of directly head-to-head against bleach sort of a bleach alterative. Number one, is that factored into your plans? Number two, do you think you\u2019ll lose shelf space to them? Does that affect your thinking at all? And then just secondarily, Steve, I wanted to go back to the comment you made that manufacturing and logistics cost your gross margin 120 basis points primarily because of the international markets and that just seems like a very large impact on your profitability given how relatively small Venezuela and Argentina are. So I guess the question is, is there anything more you can do to mitigate the margin impact of the devaluation because it just seems like a big number to me? Thanks. Don Knauss : Yes, Wendy, thanks. Don, here. Let me take the first half of the question on bleach and Oxi and then I\u2019ll turn it to Steve. I think in general we feel very good about our bleach plants for the second half, it didn\u2019t anticipate another new product from Church & Dwight but I think the program we\u2019ve out in place did anticipate significant competitive spending. So for example our trade spending on Laundry is definitely up in the second half of the year, the innovation pipeline as you know Wendy with smart seeking bleach which we think has helped offset some of the claims around bleach being harmful to a wider range of clothing options, it helps us also with a value launch of Fraganzia and also a value launch on our Tupac bleach. We think we\u2019ve got a lot of innovation out there and stronger trade support, so we think we\u2019re -- and as I noted in January we have already starting to see some share gain for the first time in 10 months, so we feel very good about the plans we have in place and think we can take on the competitive issue. Steve Robb : So Wendy, this is Steve, let me provide a perspective on the manufacturing and logistics cost, so as you noted, it increased about 120 basis points, a lot of this is coming from high inflation markets of Venezuela, Argentina and other Latin American countries. We are obviously taking steps through the cost savings programs to mitigate it, for perspective the 120 basis points represents about $16 million and the total cost savings in cost of goods sold was about 20 million in the quarter and if fact if you look at all of the lines of the P&L, the total cost savings was closer to 30 million. So we think the combination of leaning into the cost savings programs, taking pricing where we can and the belief that over the very long-term both in Venezuela and Argentina we\u2019ll be able to get pricing, we\u2019d be able to mitigate that, but certainly the gross margins this fiscal year will be challenged because we\u2019re not likely to recover all of the commodity costs and inflationary pressures we\u2019re seeing but we have got a pretty good track-record over the long-term move offsetting these costs with pricing and cost savings. Wendy Nicholson : Okay. And then just to clarify on the bleach thing, Don, you\u2019re not expecting to lose any shelf space this year over the next six months in bleach, is that right? Citigroup Research : Okay. And then just to clarify on the bleach thing, Don, you\u2019re not expecting to lose any shelf space this year over the next six months in bleach, is that right? Don Knauss : Yes, we don\u2019t anticipate that Wendy because of the innovation behind the Tupac, the new Fraganzia line items and also some new scents on king size we don\u2019t anticipate that. Wendy Nicholson : Terrific. Okay, thank you so much. Citigroup Research : Terrific. Okay, thank you so much. Don Knauss : Thanks Wendy. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Olivia Tom with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tom : Thank you. Wanted to talk a little bit about promotion, because that continues to be a big topic for both you and your peers, and I\u2019m just wondering how do you think all this plays out because it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re going to take your foot of the pedal, nor are any of your competitors, so then it\u2019s just, everyone going to operate at a new lower normal, or how do you think that plays out? And then how is the retail reaction been so far to smart bleach obviously you just shipped so there\u2019s no consumer reaction yet, but can you remind us how that\u2019s going to be merchandized is it a trade up for current bleach users, is it a stain fighter, so potentially it can go against this new OxiClean product and essentially where do you expect that share to come from? Thank you. Bank of America : Thank you. Wanted to talk a little bit about promotion, because that continues to be a big topic for both you and your peers, and I\u2019m just wondering how do you think all this plays out because it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re going to take your foot of the pedal, nor are any of your competitors, so then it\u2019s just, everyone going to operate at a new lower normal, or how do you think that plays out?

Thank you. Don Knauss : Olivia, let me take the last part of your question on smart seeking bleach, we priced it at line pricing to our regular bleach so that we could get, cold merchandizing together. We think it\u2019s going to expand use education for bleach, that\u2019s what we think particularly among millennials where they don\u2019t typically wear just pure white clothing, so we think it\u2019s an expansion of the use education for bleach and we expect it to be merchandized and shelved along with regular bleach and as I\u2019ve said that\u2019s why we priced it on a line pricing basis so we could get, cold merchandizing. Because we would expect people to potentially buy both bleaches, one we\u2019re seeing more and more usage of regular bleach in cleaning around the home, particularly during flu season and obviously smart seeking bleach more used ideally in the laundry room. Now as far as promotion goes, as you say everybody is amping up promotional spending, our spending in the first half of the year was essentially flat on trade spending, we are seeing as I noted a ramp-up in the second half particularly between behind those brands that have challenged from a share standpoint, particularly Laundry, Home Care, Litter, and Glad, so that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to primarily see the increases. Most of our increases are behind innovation spending except in the case of bleach where we\u2019re getting one incremental event basically as we get back into the regular merchandizing calendar, so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a new normal, I think everybody is obviously trying to, from a retail standpoint, trying to generate traffic, I think they\u2019re using number one brands to do that which bodes well for us. I\u2019ve met with about 15 retailers three weeks ago at the FMI Midwinter Conference in Arizona, and I think the biggest issue, all of them basically talked about was getting traffic back into their stores. So I think you\u2019re going to continue to see aggressive activity on everybody\u2019s part to help get that traffic but again, number one brands are really what\u2019s in their forefront in their mind to get the traffic private label, focusing on private label is not getting traffic in the stores and they recognize that. Don Knauss : Well the only thing I\u2019d add is that, we\u2019ve seen this before they, you tend to go in cycles with light or heavy promotional activity and it\u2019s particularly heeded right now to your point but as the retailers try to lap this going forward and with their quest for same-store sales growth eventually they\u2019re going to get back to more call it rational pricing it had some degree of rationality in the category so making it growth again. Olivia Tom : Thanks and if I could just call up on one thing, in your prepared comments you talked about mix shift is a larger packs and I remember a couple of years back that was an issue but more recently I thought that people had switched to smaller packs maybe not willing to go as far to the stores with the larger packs, is that a shift back or is this just kind of ebbs and flows.  Bank of America : Thanks and if I could just call up on one thing, in your prepared comments you talked about mix shift is a larger packs and I remember a couple of years back that was an issue but more recently I thought that people had switched to smaller packs maybe not willing to go as far to the stores with the larger packs, is that a shift back or is this just kind of ebbs and flows. Merrill Lynch : Thanks and if I could just call up on one thing, in your prepared comments you talked about mix shift is a larger packs and I remember a couple of years back that was an issue but more recently I thought that people had switched to smaller packs maybe not willing to go as far to the stores with the larger packs, is that a shift back or is this just kind of ebbs and flows. Steve Robb : This is Steve. I think it just comes as ebbs and flows, if you look at the fiscal year-to-date margin the impact of mix has been fairly benign from the first half of this fiscal year. But again, over the long-term I think as consumers have more money they tend to shift up to larger more value-oriented sizes which is one of the reasons our cost savings programs look at trying to take cost out of the system to try to mitigate that, but not a big issue for this fiscal year in terms of the first half and ongoing though I think it\u2019s going to be a trend you\u2019ll continue to see. Olivia Tom : Got it. Thank you very much. Bank of America : Got it. Thank you very much. Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Bill Schmitz : Hi. Can you just give us a little bit more color on what\u2019s going on in Wipes because, I know it\u2019s not the bulk of the sales but the scanner data looked a lot worse than the growth you reported. So, I know it\u2019s obviously the Costco business, was there anything we should keep in mind kind of as we model the lap for next year? Deutsche Bank : Hi. Can you just give us a little bit more color on what\u2019s going on in Wipes because, I know it\u2019s not the bulk of the sales but the scanner data looked a lot worse than the growth you reported. So, I know it\u2019s obviously the Costco business, was there anything we should keep in mind kind of as we model the lap for next year? Don Knauss : I think Bill, on Wipes. I think you\u2019ll start to see the share losses that we\u2019ve sustained reserve themselves out in the fourth quarter as we saw a lot of private label activity in some of our larger customers that started last April. So, you\u2019ll start to lap that. I think the other thing that you\u2019ll see is obviously the new innovation from us behind glass and tub and shower wipes is helping. And I think what I\u2019m hearing from retailers as well as they start to lap the private label push particularly some of the largest retailers we have. They\u2019re hungry for growth because they\u2019re already starting to see the category slow. If you look at -- this is the category that\u2019s been growing in mid to high single-digits. If you look at the last quarter, the category actually declined two tenths of a point and if you look at January it declined 3.2 points. So, I think people are finally recognizing you can\u2019t grow this category if you have got a 50 share brand setting on the sidelines. So, I think you\u2019re going to see through our innovation and also increased merchandising focus in the, not only this quarter but the fourth quarter we\u2019ll start to see those share declines reserve and I think you\u2019ll start to see a little bit more robust category going forward. Bill Schmitz : Got you. But it grew in the quarter, right? So, was there difference maybe with\u2026 Deutsche Bank : Got you. But it grew in the quarter, right? So, was there difference maybe with\u2026 Don Knauss : They grew substantially in the quarter because of as you said, we have a strong Costco business, club business which wasn\u2019t reflected in those numbers and also the professional side of our wipes business grew substantially as well. Bill Schmitz : Thanks. And then is there any more activity on sort of professional products acquisition front. Because it seems like we hit a little bit of a low and that was obviously a huge priority and I know it\u2019s still a very fragmented business. So, are you still in kind of integration phase before you kind of look for new properties to add in or is it just lack of available properties right now? Deutsche Bank : Thanks. And then is there any more activity on sort of professional products acquisition front. Because it seems like we hit a little bit of a low and that was obviously a huge priority and I know it\u2019s still a very fragmented business. So, are you still in kind of integration phase before you kind of look for new properties to add in or is it just lack of available properties right now? Don Knauss : We have pretty robust pipeline of targets and companies that we\u2019re interested in again keep in mind many of these are smaller bolt-on acquisitions that are held by families and others and we\u2019re going to continue to work the pipeline we haven\u2019t had anything as you say in the last year or so after we completed AppleCare and Health Link. But we have money to spend. We\u2019re actively looking for deals and we think over the next couple of years we ought to be able to get some more bolt-on acquisitions but it takes time to work these. Steve Robb : Bill I think just to help and give you all some perspective on that business and the help of that business fiscal year-to-date that recall that at the Analyst Day we walked about that part of the business growing 10% to 15% annually. That business through the first half of the fiscal is at the upper-end of that range lapping over 50% growth in the year ago half. So, that business organically is really coming on strong and continues to be a real growth driver. Bill Schmitz : Okay. Thank you so much. Deutsche Bank : Okay. Thank you so much. Don Knauss : Okay. Thanks Bill. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hi guys. Just a follow-up again on the M&A piece, so it\u2019s professional is still the number one priority in terms of acquisitions. So that you don\u2019t have that much more interest in some of these OTC properties that are coming on the market or the healthcare business for Kimberly or anything like that. It\u2019s still these kind of smaller roll up plays in professionals, is that a fair assessment? Sanford C. Bernstein: Hi guys. Just a follow-up again on the M&A piece, so it\u2019s professional is still the number one priority in terms of acquisitions. So that you don\u2019t have that much more interest in some of these OTC properties that are coming on the market or the healthcare business for Kimberly or anything like that. It\u2019s still these kind of smaller roll up plays in professionals, is that a fair assessment? Don Knauss : Yes Ali. I think that\u2019s a very fair assessment. What we\u2019ve said to-date is stopping the spread of infections in the professional space with these bolt-on acquisitions that\u2019s center of play for us. We\u2019re also open to looking at bolt-on acquisitions in core CPG brands where we think we can add value, things like Soy Vay and other brands and that continues to be the primary focus for us. These larger acquisitions they tend to have a lot of happy sellers and less happy buyers in our experience, so never say never if there is a good deal that comes along but at this point we think bolt-ons in the spaces that we\u2019ve identified are right. Ali Dibadj : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on this trade spends. I am coming at a sense of how much more it will be in the back half of the year and then perhaps even ongoing. The helpful gross margin driver chart that you showed over the past couple of years, the price changes have been 100 basis points plus and very much over, much higher than the market movement or the commodities number they have and now they\u2019ve dropped down to kind of a 75 or 70 or 80 basis point level. And again from your discussion it sounds like a lot of that is trade spend and I\u2019m just trying to figure out as you go forward how much more trade spend, how much less maybe price change should we expect in this gross margin chart as we look forward given the competitive intensity you\u2019re feeling and the retailer pressure you\u2019re feeling? Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on this trade spends. I am coming at a sense of how much more it will be in the back half of the year and then perhaps even ongoing. The helpful gross margin driver chart that you showed over the past couple of years, the price changes have been 100 basis points plus and very much over, much higher than the market movement or the commodities number they have and now they\u2019ve dropped down to kind of a 75 or 70 or 80 basis point level. And again from your discussion it sounds like a lot of that is trade spend and I\u2019m just trying to figure out as you go forward how much more trade spend, how much less maybe price change should we expect in this gross margin chart as we look forward given the competitive intensity you\u2019re feeling and the retailer pressure you\u2019re feeling? Don Knauss : Yes, you got a couple of questions embedded in there. Let me say the second half trade spending will be higher than what we saw in the year ago period. In part because what we\u2019re allocating spending out of advertising over to trade to drive some of the merchandizing and some of the new products that we have coming up so don\u2019t want to quantify a specific number but you will see the number is going up and that\u2019s part of the plan that we have to vigorously defend our market shares. In terms of the price changes, in the second quarter we had about 70 basis points of lift from pricing, I would expect that overtime, the number is going to continue to hopefully go up but a lot of it depends on our ability to get pricing in some of these international markets like Venezuela and Argentina. In the U.S., you will see us price to recover long-term commodity cost and other inflationary pressure. So commodities go up we\u2019re likely to take more pricing, if commodities stay benign we\u2019ll take less. So that number is going to float up and down based on what we see with inflation and commodity cost. Steve Robb : I think Ali just to be clear, as we do allocate some more demand spending behind trade, particularly behind new products in the second half the U.S. retail advertising and consumer promotion number is still going to remain in the 9% to 10% range whether it\u2019s been for the last couple of years. In fact, this quarter it was at 10% for U.S. retail. So we still feel strong about maintaining at least the mid to high 9s in the U.S. retail even as we allocate some of the spending out of particularly troubled international markets where it just doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to put TV on or other forms of mass media when we have price controls. Don Knauss : Ali also just a point of clarification. Ali Dibadj : Yes.  Sanford C. Bernstein: Yes. Don Knauss : That table that you\u2019re referring to, which is I believe attached to our earnings release and I know it\u2019s on our website, that price changes are strictly a rate change for price. It\u2019s a rate impact it doesn\u2019t reflect changes in trade spending. I think to the extent that you see trade spending increase in the second half of the year that will probably be reflected more in the all other line. Ali Dibadj : Understood, that\u2019s actually the clarification. Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Because I thought that was net of trade spending.  Sanford C. Bernstein: Understood, that\u2019s actually the clarification. Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Because I thought that was net of trade spending. Don Knauss : No, that\u2019s strictly rate adjusted price. Ali Dibadj : Okay, so then the all other would go up. Because currently you\u2019re not I mean Steve to your point Steve Robb to your point, you\u2019re not offsetting the commodity movements at this point with what you\u2019re seeing from a price change, rate price change perspective and you expect that gap to close going forward? Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay, so then the all other would go up. Because currently you\u2019re not I mean Steve to your point Steve Robb to your point, you\u2019re not offsetting the commodity movements at this point with what you\u2019re seeing from a price change, rate price change perspective and you expect that gap to close going forward? Steve Robb : I think over the long-term it will close. But there is always a lag, so we took a 6% price increase on the Glad business as an example to reflect the higher cost that we\u2019re seeing in resin. But we\u2019re taking that in March, it\u2019s going to take a couple of months to sell through. So, pricing we try to price as much as we can to the long-term average cost of commodity but there tends to be a bit of a lag. And so I think over the very long-term we remain confident in our ability to protect our gross margins. But you are seeing a lag. And again as we\u2019ve said many times, unfortunately the price controls in Argentina and Venezuela just add to that certainly in the short to intermediate term. Ali Dibadj : Okay. And sorry, just a quick on your -- on the quick clarification on the free cash flow to sales at 10%. That\u2019s a step up starting at quarter, right? I mean, the taxes and the pensions effectively go away this quarter and that\u2019s a step up to get to that 10%, right? It\u2019s not a ramp-up. Is that fair? Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay. And sorry, just a quick on your -- on the quick clarification on the free cash flow to sales at 10%. That\u2019s a step up starting at quarter, right? I mean, the taxes and the pensions effectively go away this quarter and that\u2019s a step up to get to that 10%, right? It\u2019s not a ramp-up. Is that fair? Steve Robb : Yes. You will see free cash flow as a percentage of sales significantly better in the second half than the first half, and that should get us to the 10%, because the tax payments in our estimate are essentially timing. We expect to go offset in the second half. Ali Dibadj : Okay, thanks very much.  Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay, thanks very much. Steve Robb : Thanks Robert. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Chris Ferrara : Thanks guys. I just wanted to go back on Cleaning for a second, right I mean so obviously the volume growth is pretty heroic on that comparison. And it sounds like Wipes were up again better than what the scanner data would have indicated. But can you just talk about I guess how bigger deal were the Bath and Glass Wipes and how sustainable was that? And I guess is there anything going on at inventory levels at the trade with those products? I mean is everything kind of normalized? Wells Fargo Securities : Thanks guys. I just wanted to go back on Cleaning for a second, right I mean so obviously the volume growth is pretty heroic on that comparison. And it sounds like Wipes were up again better than what the scanner data would have indicated. But can you just talk about I guess how bigger deal were the Bath and Glass Wipes and how sustainable was that? And I guess is there anything going on at inventory levels at the trade with those products? I mean is everything kind of normalized? Don Knauss : Yes. Chris, on the Wipes business in the quarter, it was really driven by merchandising support as the flu season ramped-up and particularly in December, it was really tied to some incremental activity behind merchandising and some of the larger customers behind Wipes. Obviously Glass, Wipes and tub and shower wipes did not ship until January. So they really didn\u2019t impact the quarter at all. So I think as I said about the second half of the year, we\u2019re going to start to see obviously improved performance on Wipes behind the innovation, behind ramped-up trade spending, resulting in more merchandising events going into the back half as well as lapping, starting in April, this significant push by private label for the few key customers. So a lot of the October, November, December, Wipes business was driven by incremental merchandising activities getting secondary locations in the number of retailers, not only in the club channel but in the grocery channel as well in pharmacies across the country. So I think a lot of guys learned from last year when the flu season ramped up, that they needed to get secondary location. So we had a lot of shippers out there, a lot of incremental locations. Chris Ferrara : So do you feel like, I mean, so if this cold and flu season to the extent that it\u2019s less a deal than it was last cold and flu season all of the secondary points of distribution, is that essentially end up amount at the inventory into channel or does it not work that way? Wells Fargo Securities : So do you feel like, I mean, so if this cold and flu season to the extent that it\u2019s less a deal than it was last cold and flu season all of the secondary points of distribution, is that essentially end up amount at the inventory into channel or does it not work that way? Don Knauss : No I think we\u2019ve seen pretty good sell through. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve heard from any retailers that we\u2019ve got a lot of hanging inventory at all particularly because the flu season this year really got more aggressive in late December and early January, through January, than it did last year. And last year remember the flu season was really ramping up in November, and this year it\u2019s been October and November, this year it\u2019s been more or like December and January. Chris Ferrara : Got it. Got it. And then just on Argentina. It sounds like you guys said that with mix in pricing, you\u2019ve been able to offset the currency devaluation so far. And relative to the $0.05 to $0.10 you guys have baked into the guidance, I mean, do you feel like again incremental devaluation aside, has that $0.05 to $0.10 been sort of an over-management of that like did you even need the $0.05 to $0.10 so far? Wells Fargo Securities : Got it. Got it. And then just on Argentina. It sounds like you guys said that with mix in pricing, you\u2019ve been able to offset the currency devaluation so far. And relative to the $0.05 to $0.10 you guys have baked into the guidance, I mean, do you feel like again incremental devaluation aside, has that $0.05 to $0.10 been sort of an over-management of that like did you even need the $0.05 to $0.10 so far? Don Knauss : Yes. The $0.05 to $0.10 was primarily designed to cover for the operating challenges in Venezuela the high rates of inflation, the price controls and it\u2019s certainly embedded in the outlook that we\u2019ve shared with everyone today. And we\u2019re using that, as Steve mentioned and as I\u2019ve mentioned before, we\u2019re losing money in Venezuela now. And we have lost money in the first half of the fiscal year, fully expect to lose money in the second half of the fiscal year and the $0.05 to $0.10 really covers for that cost. The Argentina business excluding currency effects is actually performing quite well. From an operating standpoint I think the team is doing a very nice job there, but unfortunately what we\u2019re starting to see now with the devaluation in some of challenges, it\u2019s going to certainly make for a much more difficult second half in Argentina. Chris Ferrara :  Got it thanks guys. Wells Fargo Securities :  Got it thanks guys. Don Knauss :  Thanks Chris. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to John Faucher with JPMorgan. John Faucher : Thank you. Just to follow-up on Chris\u2019s question. If we look back at your Brazil business which you guys had exited if I remember correctly. Is there a way to sort of look out four year or five years on the Argentina and Venezuela businesses and say okay, here\u2019s where we think we need to be is it a situation where you could manage the portfolio down, sell fewer products. I guess the real question is are there structural options from a more aggressive stance to manage these businesses going forward or do you just, at this point need to sort of ride things out.  JPMorgan: Thank you. Just to follow-up on Chris\u2019s question. If we look back at your Brazil business which you guys had exited if I remember correctly. Is there a way to sort of look out four year or five years on the Argentina and Venezuela businesses and say okay, here\u2019s where we think we need to be is it a situation where you could manage the portfolio down, sell fewer products. I guess the real question is are there structural options from a more aggressive stance to manage these businesses going forward or do you just, at this point need to sort of ride things out. Don Knauss : I think it\u2019s -- each country is a bit different, Argentina again that business has done really well for us, we know how to ride the ups and downs and obviously when it goes up it feels pretty good and when it goes down it\u2019s a bit more challenging. But that\u2019s a business that we think we\u2019re taking all of the right actions to make sure that we keep the very lean cost structure, we keep those brands healthy and we kind of whether the storm if you will. So I feel very good about that business over the long-term. And Venezuela is actually a much more challenging situation for us, it\u2019s a business that historically has been very profitable, one of our better businesses. And certainly the brand equities and I think are holding up very nicely. The challenge we have is we have got inflation that\u2019s running north of 50% and we have got the government that\u2019s imposed price controls on more than two-thirds of our portfolio, and as a result the business has gone from profitability to losses. What we need to assess I think over the next couple of quarters year or so, is number one, our ability get pricing through and that\u2019s where the government\u2019s going to have to kind of weigh in and say are you going to let companies take pricing or not? And second what\u2019s going to happen with the currency? Because we\u2019re currently translating that business at a CADIVI of 6.3 to 1, if you look at the parallel market it\u2019s in the high 70s, so it\u2019s pretty big gap there. So I think the combination of understanding what\u2019s going to happen with the currency as well as price controls will probably inform longer-term, what do we want to do in that business? Steve Robb : John the only thing I would add is, if you look at Argentina for example, I mean Argentina in this quarter grew over 9% in sales and over 5% in volume. So from an operating standpoint and that\u2019s not currency neutral, that\u2019s in U.S. dollar. So strong operating performance in Argentina, we did get pricing through on a number of products in October, so we\u2019re doing quite a bit better than forecast in Argentina, and as Steve said the wild-card here is the inflation rate and the currency issues going into the second half. I think from an operating standpoint we\u2019re doing the right things. In Venezuela there are structural things that we are changing, I am giving you an example. We used to have a, for example double-digit SKUs of bleach; we\u2019re going down into a handful of SKUs on bleach so we would run the lines more efficiently. There are a number of things we have done to lower our cost structure and be prudent so that while we\u2019re losing a modest amount of money year-to-date in Venezuela we\u2019re better than we forecasted going into the year. So the team is making some improvements there. There are trigger points at down the road where we say when we look at inflation rates, we look at the operating efficiencies, we\u2019re getting the ability to take pricing for example, we\u2019re having ongoing dialog with the government. I think the government is starting to realize a number of businesses are in a very tough spot, and they are going to have to do something if these businesses want to keep producing. And I don\u2019t think they want essential products like bleach out of production. So there are number of things that we\u2019re doing, but I would say both in Argentina and Venezuela given the changes we have made, we\u2019re doing better forecast and we are starting to see some vibrancy in Argentina. Don Knauss : John I think it\u2019s also helps to remember that, when we exited Brazil, I mean that was many, many years ago. We had a very fragmented relatively low market share business. I think it\u2019s hard to remember Venezuela and Argentina these are very strong market share businesses. In fact Argentina which is the bigger of the two countries for us, either of that market shares that are equal to if not north of some of our U.S. market shares, so we have got very strong businesses there. John Faucher : Okay, great. And then one sort of unrelated follow-up question which is Cat Litter, which you guys have talked a lot about, you showed us some new products at your Analyst Day. We\u2019re hearing more about this category, we have seen packaging improvements, new product improvements. Is this is a category where you can push the consumer that far ahead so that she is willing to pay more, because it seems to be getting more competitive and can you really grow the profit full in that category with this much activity? JPMorgan: Okay, great. And then one sort of unrelated follow-up question which is Cat Litter, which you guys have talked a lot about, you showed us some new products at your Analyst Day. We\u2019re hearing more about this category, we have seen packaging improvements, new product improvements. Is this is a category where you can push the consumer that far ahead so that she is willing to pay more, because it seems to be getting more competitive and can you really grow the profit full in that category with this much activity? Don Knauss : Well I think you can John I think if you look at some of the recent success that one of our competitors had with a light weighting product that is a significant premium price to what the normal litter is in the category. So we think it is a category that the last 13 weeks has grown a little bit north of 5%. We think the demographic trends are great. We do have some significant innovation coming that we think out flanks competition, and our odor control is better than it\u2019s ever been, our trade spending will go up on this business, in the second half we\u2019re going to defend these shares. So I think the combination of innovation and trade spending and packaging basically all elements of the marketing mix, everybody\u2019s hair is on fire over here to get this thing turned around. And I think we have the plans in place to do it and I do think it\u2019s a category that has terrific trend and demographics in its favor. John Faucher : Great, thanks. JPMorgan: Great, thanks. Operator : And we will go next to Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante : Hi, good afternoon everyone.  Consumer Edge Research : Hi, good afternoon everyone. Don Knauss : Hey, Javier. Javier Escalante : Hello. I have a question with regards to the guidance, right. If I go through the release you have got higher commodities, greater currency impact, you are facing a lower category growth and you need to hone on an increasing trade spending. So, it looks as if you have a lot of headwinds to offset with only 1 point of pricing at a corporate level at the end of the third quarter which corresponds to what you are doing in Glad and you just lower guidance by 1 point. Is this enough of reset in terms of to deliver your earnings forecast? And then I have another question. Consumer Edge Research : Hello. I have a question with regards to the guidance, right. If I go through the release you have got higher commodities, greater currency impact, you are facing a lower category growth and you need to hone on an increasing trade spending. So, it looks as if you have a lot of headwinds to offset with only 1 point of pricing at a corporate level at the end of the third quarter which corresponds to what you are doing in Glad and you just lower guidance by 1 point. Is this enough of reset in terms of to deliver your earnings forecast? And then I have another question. Steve Robb : So Javier, this is Steve. Let me try to provide you perspective. So, in our previous outlook we had anticipated sales growth in the range of 2% to 3%. And as I\u2019ve mentioned in my opening comments the devaluation of the Argentine peso was significantly larger than we had anticipated. So, we do think that bringing this down from 2 to 3 to 1 to 2 to reflect the new foreign exchange assumptions and somewhat slower U.S. category growth makes sense. And basically that implies that we have got 3% to 4% currency neutral sales growth on the full year and Ali just pointed out in the first half of the fiscal year sales growth on a currency neutral basis was about 3%, so it implies 3% to 4% growth in the second half. We think that\u2019s very reasonable. From an earnings per share standpoint we did drop the range by a nickel in the top and the bottom that was to deal with the FX assumption change for Argentina. Commodity costs are about what we thought in the previous outlook, they are up a little bit but not a lot. Trade spending is expected to be elevated in the second half but again not much different than what we have thought in the previous outlook. So, we do feel that this outlook is balanced and anticipates a range of assumptions. The biggest open item would be what happens with Venezuela and that\u2019s the one we are watching carefully. Javier Escalante : Okay. The second question has to do with the increase in trade promotions, Church & Dwight said it today that they are going to do the same. So, how big of an increase in shelf space whatever you are going to do buys you and for how long, so I wonder whether these payments that you are going to do to the trade, are going to benefit through 2015 or just a one quarter thing, just to support innovation and that\u2019s it? Consumer Edge Research : Okay. The second question has to do with the increase in trade promotions, Church & Dwight said it today that they are going to do the same. So, how big of an increase in shelf space whatever you are going to do buys you and for how long, so I wonder whether these payments that you are going to do to the trade, are going to benefit through 2015 or just a one quarter thing, just to support innovation and that\u2019s it? Don Knauss : Yes I think Javier, the elevation in trade spending is concentrated on a few businesses. I don\u2019t think you will see it, you are not going to see it across the board. For example we just talked about litter, you are going to see clearly support behind new products there and support behind incremental merchandizing events. So, it\u2019s not really payment for shelf space as much as it\u2019s payment for feature and display activity and whether that continues into FY15, we will see how the dynamics in the category go. But it\u2019s really more of display and feature support behind new products and increased frequency of events. Than it is anything to do with slotting allowances or anything like that. Javier Escalante : Okay. Thank you. Consumer Edge Research : Okay. Thank you. Don Knauss : Thanks, Javier. Operator : And we will go next to Michael Steib to Credit Suisse. Michael Steib : Hi, I have two questions if I may. And the first is on Burt's Bees, you mentioned that growth was flat in the quarter, is that entirely due to just a comparison base and should we therefore expect growth to pick up in the second half of the year? And then the second question is on the concentrated bleach formula, can you just confirm that that\u2019s back on the normal merchandizing cycle, so does that also support volume growth in the second half? Credit Suisse : Hi, I have two questions if I may. And the first is on Burt's Bees, you mentioned that growth was flat in the quarter, is that entirely due to just a comparison base and should we therefore expect growth to pick up in the second half of the year? And then the second question is on the concentrated bleach formula, can you just confirm that that\u2019s back on the normal merchandizing cycle, so does that also support volume growth in the second half? Don Knauss : Yes, Michael on Burt\u2019s, there was a significant growth last year. So, you are right. The interesting thing is while it was flat in the quarter consumption was up 7% and the category was up 4%. So, we gained share and consumption was in the high single-digits, so we feel good about we are lapping these big inventories moving last year with the new lip products but consumption looks strong. In fact consumption in January on Burt\u2019s was up 11%, so we feel like the trends are very good on Burt\u2019s and there is some interesting innovation coming on color for lip in the second half of the year. On, would you repeat your question on bleach, I couldn\u2019t quite hear it? Michael Steib : Back in the merchandizing segment. Credit Suisse : Back in the merchandizing segment. Don Knauss : Yes, the bleach cycle, I think one of things you are seeing with the January share increase to 60.7 we hit in January as we are getting back into the normal cadence. We are up about one full event which is about 15% to 20% increase in merchandizing activity for the year. So, we are back more into a normal cadence now on bleach. And I think as we go through the balance of the fiscal you will continue to see the share position improve particularly behind the new products that are out there. Michael Steib : Okay. Thank you very much. Credit Suisse : Okay. Thank you very much. Don Knauss : Thanks. Operator : And we will go next to Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets. Connie Maneaty : Hi, I have a question on Venezuela of course. We are hearing a couple of things, one is that instead of devaluation there in the form of an event where the government would say we are devaluing by 40%. That there might be a rolling devaluation sort of unannounced but every month or every so often the prices change, are you seeing that in your operations yet and is the rolling devaluation easier or harder to manage? And then I have a follow-up.  BMO Capital Markets : Hi, I have a question on Venezuela of course. We are hearing a couple of things, one is that instead of devaluation there in the form of an event where the government would say we are devaluing by 40%. That there might be a rolling devaluation sort of unannounced but every month or every so often the prices change, are you seeing that in your operations yet and is the rolling devaluation easier or harder to manage? And then I have a follow-up. Don Knauss : We\u2019d say it\u2019s actually a hard question to answer. The government has come out and publicly said there is no devaluation, the CADIVI remains to 6, 3. Concurrent with that, they have run C Cat auctions and while they have not published these rates. The market would seem to indicate that they\u2019re running between 11 and cal it 14. So it\u2019s a form of a stealth devaluation, we have not been able to participate in the C Cat auction to-date at least successfully. So it\u2019s fairly clearly unclear to us what is the exchange rate we\u2019re all going to have to use and for what transactions and what will the rates be. And I think we\u2019re waiting to get additional clarity on what does this multi-tiered exchange rate system look like and then what does it mean, if you\u2019ve got dual exchange rates. And the CADIVI has held at 6, 3 and then C Cat or something else continues to devalue. So lot more questions than answers. I think the only that\u2019s certain is that the Venezuelan Bolivar is significantly overvalued. And probably the good news is the Venezuela business for Clorox is something less than 2% of sales, so it\u2019s an important business, but it\u2019s not the biggest thing that we\u2019ve got in the portfolio. Connie Maneaty : Yes, well that brings up the follow-up question. This has been going on since 2010 where every so often you have to takeout $0.10 to $0.20 from your earnings outlook for a business that\u2019s 2% of sales. So when do you decide if this is really strategic or why bother it at all? BMO Capital Markets : Yes, well that brings up the follow-up question. This has been going on since 2010 where every so often you have to takeout $0.10 to $0.20 from your earnings outlook for a business that\u2019s 2% of sales. So when do you decide if this is really strategic or why bother it at all? Don Knauss : First of all I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s completely accurate Connie. In 2011, we had an all-time record of profitability in Venezuela, so I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s been going on for three years. It\u2019s really been the last 18 to 24 months when things have changed dramatically. Connie Maneaty : Okay.  BMO Capital Markets : Okay. Don Knauss : But as I said, we\u2019ve taken structural changes to lower the cost structure of that business. As I said, the team is performing better that we had forecast. We\u2019re looking at a comprehensive plan to say, okay, how do we stay and then we want to stay in this country for the long-term because it has been over the last 10 years, one of the best, if not the best performing countries in Latin America for us. So, we\u2019re making it more efficient. We\u2019re having dialogue with the government. I think we\u2019re getting at a tipping point whether the government is going to have to sit down with a number of businesses and just say, look, if you want us to stay here long-term you are going to have to give us a reasonable profit margin. And we\u2019ll be having that dialogue in the next 30, 60, 90 days with the government. Clearly, we don\u2019t like the situation we\u2019re in through fiscal \u201914, but we\u2019re doing better with than forecast and it\u2019s not going to be a significant drag unless there is another major devaluation going forward. Connie Maneaty : Thanks, very much.  BMO Capital Markets : Thanks, very much. Don Knauss : Okay Connie. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks, good afternoon. First question was just on private label. The mention of it in the release and I think on the call, so with Brita filters that was actually the first time I\u2019d heard about that, so could you just, is that a newer dynamic? How prevalent this private label? Has there been in shifts in shelf space? And do you at this point have any plans to kind of be able to stay ahead of that becoming a more lasting trend? Barclays Capital : Thanks, good afternoon. First question was just on private label. The mention of it in the release and I think on the call, so with Brita filters that was actually the first time I\u2019d heard about that, so could you just, is that a newer dynamic? How prevalent this private label? Has there been in shifts in shelf space? And do you at this point have any plans to kind of be able to stay ahead of that becoming a more lasting trend? Don Knauss : Yes Lauren, it\u2019s primarily in one customer, a large customer, but it\u2019s in one customer. And we do have plans to change our filters over the next two quarters. So, you\u2019ll see a very different filter structure for us coming out and we think it addresses this issue. Lauren Lieberman : And will those different filters then require new pitchers too? Barclays Capital : And will those different filters then require new pitchers too? Don Knauss : Well, put it this way, the new filter will be unique at how it fits into our pitcher. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Okay. Great. And then second thing which is I\u2019m actually feeling a little bit confused on the conversation on your own spending on trade promotion because my understanding was that, your expectation for the year was that first half was heavier trade promotion activity until you had the innovation that you\u2019d planned to launch in the second half? So how did that not exactly play out? Was it that, it was just in terms of a first half second half story, did I misunderstand to begin to with but I thought really the plan was we\u2019ll promote to protect our shares until we have got new product activity? Barclays Capital : Okay. Okay. Great. And then second thing which is I\u2019m actually feeling a little bit confused on the conversation on your own spending on trade promotion because my understanding was that, your expectation for the year was that first half was heavier trade promotion activity until you had the innovation that you\u2019d planned to launch in the second half? So how did that not exactly play out? Was it that, it was just in terms of a first half second half story, did I misunderstand to begin to with but I thought really the plan was we\u2019ll promote to protect our shares until we have got new product activity? Steve Robb : Laura, this is Steve. I think you are probably misunderstood. Our trade spending for the first half of the fiscal year is essentially flat on a year-on-year basis. Don Knauss : As a percentage of sale. Steve Robb : As a percentage of sales. And as we look to the second half of the fiscal year, the plans that we have put in place many months ago is to increase that to defend our market shares and to support the innovation. So there has been no change to the trade promotion plans. We\u2019re just continuing to echo the fact that trades promotion spending will be up in the second half as planned. Don Knauss :  Yes. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. And the final thing was just on pricing in Argentina, if you had heard any chat or anything around price control potentially becoming more onerous or coming into some of your categories or if that\u2019s not really been a source of worry just yet? Barclays Capital : Okay. And the final thing was just on pricing in Argentina, if you had heard any chat or anything around price control potentially becoming more onerous or coming into some of your categories or if that\u2019s not really been a source of worry just yet? Don Knauss : We have had been under price controls for some time. We were able to get pricing through the second quarter which is certainly going to help the results. I think we\u2019ll have to see following this significant devaluation what the government does. They tend to tighten up a little bit on the price controls in the short-term has been our experience. But in Argentina, we have been able to take pricing just not as much as pricing as we would like to get and we\u2019ll have to see how it plays out over the next few quarters. Steve Robb : Yes, the Government of Argentina has certainly more flexibility around pricing particularly behind innovation, so that\u2019s what why we were successful in October so I think that\u2019s what helped drive the results in the second quarter. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. And if the outlook and adjustment you\u2019ve made for Argentina, what\u2019s the assumption around your ability to price in the second half of the year? Barclays Capital : Okay. And if the outlook and adjustment you\u2019ve made for Argentina, what\u2019s the assumption around your ability to price in the second half of the year? Don Knauss : Essentially it assumes that the pricing that we have taken that we can carry into the second half of the year, we\u2019re hopeful to get more pricing but we\u2019re not counting on it right now. Steve Robb : Yes, there\u2019s nothing, no incremental pricing baked into the plan for the back half Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Okay great, thanks so much. Barclays Capital : Okay great, thanks so much. Don Knauss : Thank you. Operator : And that concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Knauss I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to you. Don Knauss : Well thank you everyone we know it was a, you had a lot going on today with the Church & Dwight Analyst Day as well so we appreciate the strong attendance and we look forward to talking to you on the next call. Thanks everyone. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, you may begin your conference. Steve Austenfeld : Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining Clorox's third quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Don Knauss, Clorox's Chairman and CEO; and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for 7 days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com. Let me remind you that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today\u2019s press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the financial results area of our website, as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today\u2019s earnings release. Please recognize that today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Turning to our prepared remarks. I'll cover today's highlights of our third quarter business performance by segment. Steve will then address our Q3 financial results, our updated financial outlook for fiscal '14 and our preliminary financial outlook for fiscal '15. Finally, Don will close with his perspective on the business followed by Q&A. In the third quarter, including the impact of negative foreign currencies, sales decreased 2%. The impact from foreign currencies was particularly acute in Argentina, as well as in Venezuela where we moved to SICAD I, effectively resulting in a meaningful devaluation. On a currency-neutral basis, sales increased more than 1%, reflecting strong growth in our International and Household segments, partially offset by softness in Home Care due to a distribution loss and ongoing intense competitive pressures in our Wipes business, as well as generally sluggish categories across our U.S. Retail business. Volume decreased 0.5% in the quarter. Our U.S. 13-week market share results show a decrease of 0.3 points versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting ongoing intense competitive activity. While we saw share gains in our Laundry, Burt\u2019s Bees and Food business and flat results in Glad, these are more than offset by decreases in our Home Care, Brita, Cat Litter and Kingsford businesses. At the same time, our categories grew 0.4 points in the third quarter, although it's a bit slower than the prior quarter's growth rate of 0.6 points due to the impact of extreme weather across much of the nation, and category growth remains below our 2020 strategy assumption of at least 1% annual growth. Improving our category trends and market shares is our #1 priority right now, which Don will further discuss in a few minutes. Now let me turn to our third quarter results by segment. Our Cleaning segment volume decreased 5% with sales down 4%, driven primarily by decreases in our Home Care business from Disinfecting wipes. As we have discussed, our Disinfecting Wipes business continues to face an intensely competitive environment, more intense than we have seen in years. After we achieved a record share a year ago, competitors have become very aggressive in the marketplace, causing us to increase trade spending to even greater levels than we anticipated a few quarters ago. Volume in our disinfecting products was also impacted by a mild cold and flu season relative to last year. In addition, the Disinfecting Wipes category has recently seen significant distribution swings among large retailers. During the quarter, we lost Wipes distribution with a club customer while picking up distribution at 2 other key retailers. Clorox remains the clear category leader with market share near 50% in track channels, and with recently improving share trends, we're optimistic this encouraging trend will continue. We remain committed to supporting this business across our 3D demand-building model, including increased consumer promotions; consumer communication across TV, radio and digital, highlighting the value of Clorox Wipes versus competitors' products; high levels of quality merchandising; and recently launched new Wipes products for glass, tub and shower cleaner. Our Laundry business experienced volume and sales decreases due to category softness impacting our Clorox 2 Laundry additives. However, we are pleased with share gains in the quarter for Clorox Liquid Bleach, which was lapping very high growth in the year ago period and has once again surpassed a 60% market share. Finally, volume and sales gains on our Professional Products business were driven by our Healthcare and Professional Cleaning segments. Looking ahead for the Clean division, we continue to expect heightened competitive pressures, which we are responding to aggressively with increased investments to drive brand and category growth. In our Household segment, volume grew 5%, and sales grew 4%. The segment's top line results were largely driven by increased sales and shipments of Kingsford and Glad products. Our Charcoal business grew in comparison to a weak year ago quarter and was also driven by increased merchandising support to help kick off the grilling season. That said, Charcoal volume and sales fell short of expectations as weather was, similar to last year, quite poor in much of the country in the third quarter. Top line growth in our Glad business was driven or due to increased shipments in advance of a price increase and increased merchandising at a number of key retailers. Advance purchases of Glad products, ahead of our March price increase, are likely to reduce shipments in the fourth quarter. That said, we are pleased that we continue to grow share in the higher margin premium Trash Bag segment. Turning to Cat Litter. Volume increased as a result of strong category growth and increased merchandising, though sales lagged due to unfavorable mix and increased trade promotion spending in the face of heightened competitive pressures. In response, we're looking forward to our August launch of Fresh Step Extreme Lightweight, which we believe will provide the lightweight product many consumers seek with the excellent clumping and odor control that Fresh Step consumers have come to expect from our premium Cat Litters. Volume in our Lifestyle segment decreased 1% while sales decreased 3%. Sales lagged volume due to higher trade promotion spending, primarily on our Food business. Volume gains in our Food business, from increased shipments of Hidden Valley bottled and dry salad dressings, were more than offset by decreases on our Brita business due to ongoing category softness and competitive activity. We anticipate having a meaningful competitive response out in the first half of next fiscal year on our Brita business. Turning to our International segment. Volume increased 1%, and sales decreased 6%. Sales lagged volume due to 15 percentage points of negative foreign currency impacts across many International markets, notably in Argentina, Venezuela, Canada, Chile and Australia. On a currency-neutral basis, International sales grew 9%, reflecting very strong gains in strategic growth markets behind innovation and higher brand investments. Steve will provide further details on Venezuela and Argentina in a moment. With that, for fiscal year 2014, we now anticipate sales to be down slightly, reflecting softness in the company's U.S. Retail business and foreign currency declines. On a currency-neutral basis, we anticipate International segment sales to increase, and total company sales to grow about 2%. Steve will provide additional detail on factors impacting our sales growth in fiscal year '14, as well as discuss our fiscal year '15 sales outlook. With that, I'll turn it over to Steve Robb. Stephen M. Robb: Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. So for the quarter, diluted earnings per share increased 5% despite the negative impact of an effective currency devaluation in Venezuela. In March, we started using the SICAD I rate of VEF 10.8 to USD 1 to record our Venezuela business operations. This devaluation reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.13. Excluding this charge, earnings per share from continuing operations is $1.18. With that, let me take you through the details of our third quarter financial results. Sales for the third quarter declined 2%, reflecting more than 3 points of foreign currency declines, and nearly 1 point of higher trade promotion spending, partially offset by about 1.5 points of pricing, primarily in international and 1 point of favorable mix. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies, sales were up more than 1%. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 41.8%, a decline of 30 basis points. We delivered $21 million in cost savings or 140 basis points and about 80 basis points from pricing, primarily in International markets. These benefits were more than offset by 120 basis points of commodity costs, primarily related to resin, as well as 120 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, due in part to continued inflation in International markets, particularly in Venezuela and Argentina. Selling and administrative expense for the third quarter was about 13% of sales, down 80 basis points versus a year ago, driven by a reduction in employee incentive compensation accruals, reflecting anticipated lower year-over-year payouts, consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. The total incentive compensation accrual reduction was about $25 million or about $0.12 of diluted earnings per share impact benefiting several lines on the P&L, including cost of goods sold, selling and administrative expense and R&D costs. Advertising spending for the current quarter was nearly 9% of sales. Spending in the U.S. remained above 9% of sales, exceeding investment levels in International. On an absolute basis, advertising dollars were lower as we shifted a portion of our demand-building investment in the current quarter to trade promotion to address the intense competitive environment. Our third quarter effective tax rate of 35.3% on earnings from continuing operations was more than 1 point higher versus the year ago quarter, reducing diluted earnings per share by $0.02. The higher rate was primarily driven by the non-deductible costs related to the Venezuela currency devaluation this quarter. For the full fiscal year, we now anticipate an effective tax rate of about 35%. Net of all of the factors I discussed today, in the third quarter, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.05. Year-to-date free cash flow was $346 million versus $352 million in the same period year ago. This modest decrease is the result of the timing of tax payments, funding of liabilities under certain nonqualified deferred compensation plans, partially offset by lower capital expenditures. Importantly, we continue to anticipate free cash flow and the percentage of net sales will be about 10% for the fiscal year. In the third quarter, we repurchased about 1.5 million shares of common stock at a cost of about $130 million. And we also ended the quarter with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.2 to 1, within our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x. Now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2014 outlook. As Steve mentioned, we now anticipate sales to be down slightly for the fiscal year, reflecting softness in our U.S. Retail business, including lower than previously anticipated charcoal sales in the second half of the year. In addition, our outlook continues to reflect more than 2 points of foreign currency declines for the full year with about 3 percentage points impacting the second half. For perspective, softness in our U.S. Retail business is contributing about 3/4 of the decrease in our sales outlook with the Venezuela devaluation making up the balance. Higher year-over-year trade spending in the fourth quarter will also temper sales growth. On a currency-neutral basis, sales are now anticipated to grow about 2% for the fiscal year. Turning to gross margin. We continue to anticipate gross margin for the full fiscal year to be down slightly, reflecting the margin impact of our updated foreign exchange outlook and continued commodity cost headwinds. All other assumptions about gross margin remain generally the same, including an anticipated benefit of 150 basis points from cost savings, partially offset by about 100 basis points of negative impact from inflation affecting manufacturing and logistics costs. We continue to take pricing actions where possible to help offset higher commodity costs and inflation. And as we mentioned in our press release, we increased Glad trash prices by 6% in March to help offset the rising cost of resin. We continue to expect our fiscal year EBIT margin to be flat to up 25 basis points, reflecting lower selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales, driven by reduced employee incentive compensation accruals and the company's ongoing productivity programs. Advertising spending on our U.S. Retail business is expected to be about 9% of sales. With $0.15 of negative impact on the fiscal year from the recent currency devaluation in Venezuela, we now anticipate diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.25 to $4.35 for fiscal year 2014. Now I'll turn to our financial outlook for 2015. As we noted in our press release, our preliminary outlook anticipates flat sales for the year. On a currency-neutral basis, our outlook anticipates sales growth of 1% to 3%, excluding the negative impact of more than 2 percentage points from currency declines in Argentina, Venezuela and other countries. Following the third quarter devaluations in both Argentina and Venezuela, we expect currency declines to be higher in the first half of the fiscal year. These headwinds, combined with intense competitive pressures, may result in lower sales in the first half of the fiscal year followed by stronger sales in the second half. Finally, our sales outlook also assumes about 3 points of incremental sales growth from new product innovation and the benefit of price increases, as well as the negative impacts of higher trade promotion spending and unfavorable mix. Now let me make a comment about Venezuela. Our fiscal year 2015 outlook also assumes the ability to increase prices on controlled products in Venezuela where price freezes have been imposed on more than 2/3 of our portfolio for well over 2 years. Over the last few years, continued inflation in Venezuela has more than doubled our manufacturing costs. Although it's our desire to continue supplying millions of Venezuelans with the product they use every day, we continue to seek immediate, meaningful and ongoing price relief to address the deteriorating margins and operating losses in that country. Now turning to EBIT margin. For fiscal 2015, we anticipate margin to increase 25 to 50 basis points, reflecting cost savings of about 150 basis points, some benefit from pricing in International markets and moderated year-over-year commodity costs. We expect these factors to be partially offset by high inflation impacting manufacturing and logistics costs, as well as higher advertising investment. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales are forecast to be about 14%, which assumes a return to targeted levels of incentive compensation versus the significantly reduced level this year. We also anticipate an effective tax rate of 34% to 35% in fiscal 2015. Net of all of these factors, we anticipate fiscal 2015 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $4.35 to $4.50. Importantly, this outlook assumes continued double-digit devaluations in both Venezuela and Argentina. Looking forward, we're committed to accelerating top line growth through product innovation and stepped up investments in our demand building programs. To fund this, we're going to continue to focus on the things we can control, including leaning harder in on our cost savings programs and driving efficiencies to increase productivity. And with that, I will turn it over to Don. Donald R. Knauss: Okay, thanks, Steve, and hello to everyone on the call. Well, as Steve said, we delivered 5% diluted EPS in the quarter even with the impact of the devaluation of Venezuela. That said, we're certainly not satisfied with the results of these quarter. And looking ahead, our top priorities are building our market share, driving category growth and getting back to the trajectory to achieve our Strategy 2020 targets. Those are the targets we shared with you last fall on the Analyst Day out here in Pleasanton. So as we shared with you for several years now, we've looked at our growth strategy in terms of the financial algorithm, which rolls up on our U.S. Retail business, which represents about 75% of our business; our Professional Products business, which makes up about 5%; and then International, which contributes a little over 20% to overall sales. So what I thought I'd do is give you a look at how we anticipate each of those 3 legs of our business contributing to sales growth in fiscal '15. So in U.S. Retail, our 2020 goal that we laid out for you last fall was growth of 2% to 3% annually. And in FY '15, while it will certainly be challenging to achieve that, particularly in the first half of the year, we believe we have the plans in place to grow near the low end of that range for the full year. Now in the U.S., as you all know, we face an intensely competitive environment and sluggish categories, and the economy continues to be bumpy, just noting the GDP being basically flat for the first quarter as testament to that. Now despite a March uptick in consumer optimism, confidence again dipped slightly in April with consumers reporting less optimism regarding current business and labor market conditions with a proportion of consumers anticipating a drop in income growth, given the increased payroll taxes now for more than a year, and certainly reductions in key government assistance programs like the SNAP program and concerns about health care costs. Now for us, nothing is more important than probably restoring our U.S. market shares and growing our categories, and we're investing heavily to improve our consumer value proposition. So here's what we're going to do as we head into -- as we are in the fourth quarter and heading into FY '15, our 3D brand-building execution is going to focus on harder-hitting consumer communications that demonstrate visually and through messaging our superior value to drive desire. I think one testament to that is the new bleach advertising I think many of you have seen. Second, superior benefit-oriented packaging and competitive price points at the point of decide. I think an example of that is our new 4-pack Wipes package that is now out there touting our benefits much more boldly. And then lastly, consumer preferred new product innovation with harder-hitting claims that demonstrate our superiority and would delight our consumers. You'll see new Burt's Bees lip crayons, for example, hitting this summer that are 100% natural. And this -- as I said, those are examples and we think this approach is certainly working holistically on bleach. As we shared with you last fall, when we launched the fully integrated 3D plan, we wanted to reinforce the value of Clorox Bleach and using innovation to differentiate our products versus private label. And I think you can see with our share results, I think they speak for themselves, having once again surpassed the 60% market share. We were at 60.6% for the quarter, the past 13-week period, up nearly 0.5 share point. The 2020 goal for Professional Products is for 10% to 15% annual growth, and we anticipate this fast-growing business to have another strong year in fiscal '15 to land within that annual growth range. We continue to believe there are certainly tailwinds in that space, and we have a differentiated right to win there as we seek to grow our base business and organically expand through product and category adjacencies. Now in International, our 2020 goal that we communicated to all of you was annual growth of 5% to 7%. And in fiscal '15, this is where we are most challenged because we face negative impact from foreign currency in numerous markets, as Steve noted most significantly in Argentina and Venezuela, along with certainly difficult operating environments in those 2 countries. We're focusing on the things we can control there such as preserving cash and reducing costs while we work persistently with governments in both countries to secure meaningful price increases. And while we expect we can achieve the segment growth goal on a currency-neutral basis, our outlook reflects continued devaluation in both of those countries. It also assumes we'll be able to execute price increases at some level in Venezuela. Now factoring in these impacts, we project a single-digit decline for our International business next fiscal year, which is the reason we're projecting to fall short of our annual 3% to 5% sales growth target as a company. Apart from the difficulties in Argentina and Venezuela, our International business remains pretty healthy, and we're executing well. We're seeing growth in many markets in and beyond Latin America and our Burt's Bees business outside the U.S. And I think that's why on a currency-neutral basis, we had almost double-digit growth in International. Now to summarize, we're certainly facing some speed bumps in the year ahead, and I believe we're being prudent in our assumptions regarding the headwinds we face. Importantly, we have strong plans in place to address them. First, as we noted, we're investing about one additional point of demand spending to support our brand and turn our market shares around and grow our categories. Nothing is more important, and we are keenly focused on ensuring consumers understand the superior value our products offer. Second, we believe in innovation. We remain committed to our goal for 3 points of growth from innovation next year. The August introduction of Fresh Step Extreme Lightweight builds on the innovation we launched earlier this year, including the new Wipes Steve mentioned, Clorox Smart Seeking Bleach and Clorox Fraganzia bleach and more. And third, we're driving improvements in productivity and administrative cost even with increased spending. And finally, we are certainly doing all we can to manage through the challenges in Argentina and Venezuela. And with that, let's go to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Powers with UBS. Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Steve, maybe just a quick clarifying question to begin with, did you -- if I missed it I apologize, but did you talk about or could you quantify the impact of if you aren't able to get the pricing in Venezuela or Argentina that you've assumed what the financial impact would be next year at '15? Stephen M. Robb: Yes. So our assumption is for pricing next year, it's about 1 point of incremental sales growth for the company as a whole. I will tell you that a small piece of that is Venezuela from a total company perspective. So getting pricing in Venezuela is critical to the health of the Venezuelan business and our ability to continue to produce product for that country and those people. But it's a very small piece of the sales growth that we're counting on next year. Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. I guess my real question is more around innovation and the challenges you're facing in categories like Wipes and Brita, Cat Litter. Just given how focused you are on innovation, I just -- I guess I struggle with how you've seemingly exceeded the innovation lead in those categories, opening the door to rivals and/or copycat private label-type imitations. I guess my real question is why weren't those categories better protected? Or maybe that narrative is incorrect, so if you could set me straight, that'd be helpful. Donald R. Knauss: Yes. Steve, let me start. This is Don. Let's take it one by one. On Wipes, I don't think we ceded the innovation agenda at all in Wipes. I think what we saw in Wipes after about 1.5 years ago, we hit almost a 60% share just before the start of the '13 flu season. We were pounding on competitors pretty good. And what we saw and basically our Wipes issues are focused in 2 or 3 customers, is we saw an onslaught from private label on pricing. We've always maintained that our brands have the ability to command a price premium. And when we're in the 25% to 30% premium range like we are on bleach, for example, and we're gaining share again, we can do that. When we start getting outside that 25% to 30% band, which is exactly what happened to us in Wipes, we got hammered. Now we've rolled out glass Wipes, which are doing quite well, tub and shower. We've also launched just a new 4 pack, for example, in our largest customer. That's doing extremely well. We're launching a new 5 pack in club, and we're getting much more declarative in terms of our benefits versus competition on that packaging. So I think it's been more of a victim of our own success in Wipes and creating a bit of a pricing umbrella, which we are managing now. But I think from an innovation standpoint in terms of the quality of the Wipe, getting into different Cleaning occasions like glass and tub and shower, I don't think anybody touches us there. So that's Wipes. On Litter, I think this is again a value issue. If you look at our share loss over the last year, 2 share points, it's all in Fresh Step Scoop Away, which is our value brand that's held share, in fact, built a little bit of a tick up in share. And we did get outflanked in innovation, I believe. And I think sometimes we are -- we try to be too perfect, and perfection's the enemy of progress. I think the lightweight product that we are coming out with in August is a better product, we believe, than our competitors have. At least that's our consumer testing. It's also only a 12% premium versus competitor products that are light-weighted that are over a 50% premium versus regular litter. So I think we're going to retake the high ground in Litter as well. In terms of Brita, we are the category in Brita. And again this was a -- not so much a lack of innovation although there has been in total. I mean, the innovation we did on on-the-go bottles, for example, driven us to an 80% share. And in fact in the April data that we just got yesterday, we've seen Brita gain share in total again. I think we did get, again, outflanked on a pricing standpoint. I mean, we got up to a 50% premium on our 3-pack filters versus private label competitors. That cannot stand. And right now, we're going back through and looking at how we allocate retail customer marketing funds and trade funds to get more into the cost of goods to lower that price to get it back into a 25% to 30% range. You're also seeing new innovation from us on bottle-on-the-go. We just launched a 34-ounce solid bottle. And you're going to see new pitchers and new filters from us in FY '15. So that kind of gives you a snapshot, Steve, of how we're trying to launch and reclaim the ground that we've lost. But a lot of this has been because of extremely competitive pricing pressure. Operator : We will take our next question from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : So 2 questions for me. Just talking about the Wipes distribution losses. My understanding is, a very large customer but their category growth has really slowed since the transition has occurred, and I'm just curious kind of if you think perhaps you might be able to get back distribution just given some of the category trends. And then the second question is kind of more bigger picture is I've always regarded Clorox as best-in-class when it comes to category management. You guys do a great job of managing the businesses you're in. And I just wondered just given the top line has been struggling for quite some time, and I get the macro environment, I understand that. But it just seems like you could put your capabilities more to use by being a little bit more acquisitive in other categories within the supermarket, and I just -- Don, I was wondering if you can just philosophically explain kind of how you think about that? Donald R. Knauss: Yes, okay. Thanks, Nik. Yes, on the first question, the customer that we lost distribution in and I've lived through this in other companies. It's typically -- this is an annual program. We'll see if it -- if we can make an adjustment inside that 12 months. But to your point, their category is down in significant double digits. And interestingly, the distribution that we picked up in another large customer, their Wipes category is now larger as a total category in Wipes than the other customer. But we don't have an 80% share in that customer. So we haven't made up totally the volume there. But I think we've not only gained distribution in another top 5 customer, but we've also picked up in another top 10 -- 2 other top 10 customers, some incremental distribution. So I think it'll play out over the course of the next 3 to 6 months as we build that back. We always have hope that we'll be able to go in where we lost the distribution, especially after a 6-month check-in with this customer to see, if those trends continue at the current rate, we would expect and hope that they would be open to that discussion. But I think with the distribution we have gained in other customers, and that continues to build and with the innovation around the 4 pack and the new 5 pack and glass, et cetera, I think we feel much better about our position. And in fact, I would say to you just like we told you folks in October that we would see share gains on bleach again in this quarter, which we delivered on. I think we're confident that you will see share gains again from us on Wipes in May and June as we cycle through this. So feel good about that. As far as the other thing, Nick, on igniting these categories and getting more category growth, we are pushing harder into adjacencies. Let's take Hidden Valley as an example. We now have the #2 brand in pasta kits, for example. We have the #2 in sandwich spreads or the #3 in sandwich spreads now. So our dry dip and dry salad business is growing 14%, 15%. So we are starting to push into these adjacencies and you'll see more of that as we go forward. We're doing everything we can to ignite the growth by looking at adjacencies. We'll also continue to look at acquisitions that are down the middle of the fairway for us like we did with Soy Vay. Clearly, that's a small business, but it's really growing at double digit rates. So beyond Personal Care or Healthcare, the second priority for us is acquisitions that are in those core categories for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Two quick questions. First, a housekeeping item. I think I heard you when you're talking about fiscal '15 guidance say that you're assuming continued currency erosion in Venezuela and Argentina. Did I hear that correctly? Donald R. Knauss: Yes. Stephen M. Robb: You did. We're assuming double-digit decreases in both the Argentine peso and the Venezuelan bolivar next year. To be really clear about it, we moved to SICAD I, and we expect that as more of a free-floating rate, it'll continue to devalue. So we're not assuming it'll go to SICAD II, but we are expecting ongoing devaluation. Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Got it. Sounds like a pretty prudent assumption. Now I want to turn my attention to a category you haven't really talked about, liquid cleaners. It's the category that by our data, just looking at the Nielsen numbers, you've been losing quite a bit of share in for a pretty persistent period of time with private label gaining, SC Johnson gaining, P&G gaining. Can you talk about some of the dynamics in that category, and what may stem those share losses? Donald R. Knauss: Yes. Well, let me start by saying this, Jason. I think in Home Care, we actually -- we've been hit by share losses primarily because of Wipes. But to your point, on dilutables in particular, we lost share on Pine-Sol. Although there is light at the end of the tunnel. In March, we saw actually a total -- in total Home Care, we saw a share gain of 0.2 share point. And I would say this on Pine-Sol. I think what's -- we've seen a lot of innovation from Procter on Mr. Clean, and we've seen a lot of competitive pricing from other competitors in that space, right, from Fabuloso from Colgate. So clearly, we're focused on innovation around Pine-Sol, the squirt mop thing we just rolled out, it's too early to tell how that's going. But you'll see new fragrances from us. You'll see different bottle shapes and sizes down the road from us. But it's clearly going to be -- it's an innovation game, and it's also a pricing, same kind of issue I talked about in the other categories where we've let our price gap drift up too much, and that's one of the things we're going to reference. Now as I said, I think we feel good about the fact now that Home Care shares in total are growing again. And I do think you'll see our Wipes shares regain and rebound in May and June. And the dilutable piece is something we're focused on but with an innovation bend, as well as looking at our trade spending and how we deploy those funds to get the pricing on shelf right. Operator : Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Quick question first. You talked about the fact that embedded in your fiscal '15 outlook is your assumption that you will get some pricing. So you've obviously had a couple of discussions with the government around getting pricing in Venezuela, Argentina. But what's sort of plan of action if those discussions don't turn out fruitful and pricing isn't an option? Donald R. Knauss: Okay, let me take that, Olivia. We have been in high-level discussions with the government. I think we want nothing more than what the Government of Venezuela wants, which is to be able to make a fair profit. And I think they recognize the straits that our business is in and the fact that something has to give or certainly the business, in its current form, is not sustainable. So I think we'll be able to give you a much better update when we get to the August call as we work through these issues with the government. But given the recent price increases they awarded to the Food segment in that country, I think we have some level of optimism that we're going to be able to get this pricing through. But I want to be really clear for everyone and with our investors that I just want to build this algorithm for you so that there's no confusion or that there's any conclusion that we're overly dependent on getting pricing in any given market. When we put the top line algorithm together, we said, look, we've got about 3 points of growth from innovation and 1 point of growth from pricing, and about 90% of that pricing is in International markets. Now that gives us 4 points of growth. We've got more than 2 points of currency headwinds in this thing. So let's just round it to about 2.5 points of currency, and that includes these double-digit assumptions on devaluations in Venezuela and Argentina, which as Jason noted, we think is prudent. That gets us down to about 1.5 points. The reason we're not coming out with a higher top line estimate than the flat that we put out there is given the competitive intensity in the U.S. and the volatility of foreign currency, we don't think it's prudent to promise more to investors than that. So we may be accused of being somewhat prudent in these assumptions, but we think that's the right way to go. Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : And then you mentioned a couple times about price gaps drifting up too much between you and private label and some of your other competitors. Donald R. Knauss: Yes. Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : And with that, you've got a fiscal '15 outlook for 25 to 50 basis points of EBIT margin expansion despite the fact that FX will still be a near-term drag. So can you talk about some of the puts and takes within that margin? If you've got to spend more, you've got to promote and price more, is cost saves coming up to offset that delta or what else is going on in the equation to help offset that? Stephen M. Robb: Sure. This is Steve. Let me lead off on that. So it starts with the gross margin expansion. As we look into next year, we, number one, have very good cost savings programs planned. So we feel very good about that. And as Don and as I noted earlier, we are also anticipating about 1 point of pricing. And we think those 2 factors are going to be sufficient to kind of overcome inflation and commodity cost increases and should lead to solid gross margin expansion next year. And I think if you let that just flow through the bottom line and again we're going to continue to aggressively pursue savings on the SG&A line, we think the combination of those 2 things should translate into solid EBIT margin expansion. Operator : Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : My 2 questions. First of all, just on Venezuela. I think you've already been taking some pricing on a piece of your portfolio. Is that not correct? Stephen M. Robb: Yes, we \u2013 the -- with that 2/3 of our products, a little over 2/3 are under price controls, 1/3 is not. We've been able to get very small limited amounts of pricing in the non-controlled categories historically. Donald R. Knauss: And Wendy, one thing I would note, too, that of the pricing that we've assumed for Venezuela next year, almost half of it is carryover pricing that we've already gotten this year. Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Got it. Okay, fine. And then turning to the Wipes business, if I'm not mistaken and I may have a faulty recollection here, but I think you used to do some private label manufacturing for the Wipes business for certain customers and then you decided to exit that. But given how private label is gaining share and seems to sort of be a more persistent thorn in your side, I guess, number one, does that reflect your loss of control over private label since you're no longer doing it? And would you entertain bringing that back in house? Donald R. Knauss: Yes, we didn't do private label on Wipes, Wendy. We did private label on Food bags in Glad that we exited about 5 years ago. So we've never done private label on Wipes. I would say that with the tremendous focus on private label in a couple of key customers, what is happening is the category is now slowing to -- I mean, the category grew in the last quarter just 0.5, and this is a category that was growing in the mid-singles consistently for quarter after quarter after quarter. So I think the retailers who have driven this hard are recognizing that it's almost impossible to drive a category forward if you don't have the 50 share branded guy who's premium priced driving with you. So I think as I said, I'm pretty confident as we sit here today that you're going to see our shares rebound there. But I think private label has its role to play, but I think you'll see a resurgence from us as we lap through this last year. Operator : Next question is from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Can you, I guess, characterize the type of competition you're seeing? Look, it's not a new concept obviously, we've heard that from a bunch of companies this quarter. Obviously, you've said you're promoting more but what do you see from competitors? I mean, is it your sense that this is just a momentary reaction to weaker volume in the near term? Or are you seeing anything that might make it sound or seem a little bit different from what you've seen in the past? Donald R. Knauss: Well, I think let me start, Chris. I think there are a few things going on. First of all, why these categories in general, not just ours but across the CPG space, are fairly sluggish. And I think there are a few things obviously going on. We talked about the fragile consumer, the fact that wages are stagnant. We've talked about the fact that government assistance programs have been whacked back. We've talked about the horrible weather in the quarter, which obviously had an impact on GDP. I think the other thing is we've seen a spike in the number of people 18 to 34 living at home. I mean, 6 years ago it was 27% of people of that age group living at home with their parents, now it's 31%. We think there's about 1.5 million to 2 million households that haven't been formed that should have been formed. You add up all those factors and I think you get sluggish categories. So people are chasing volume. The other thing is you look at the volatility in emerging markets and the currency issues and people are refocused on the U.S. market and driving -- trying to drive growth in the U.S. market. So I think you put all those factors together, and you get kind of a perfect storm of events going on. And then if you look at the last year, the pattern in CPG for the previous 4 years had been a fairly good consistent pattern of pricing and volume was kind of sluggish to declining. Now you're seeing volume and pricing almost matching up with each other because people are chasing that volume. And I think that's more of a temporary phenomenon than not, hopefully as we see the economy pick up. But we are seeing that there's such a lack of pricing in the category because of all those other events that I mentioned. You've got a fragile consumer out there. So it's pretty tough. So I think that's what's going on. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : That helps and actually leads to sort of a follow-up, right. I mean gross margins, and I know there's only 1 quarter left in '14, but gross margins you're still looking for them to be modestly down. That's unchanged. But there's more pressure, right? And you guys obviously have said you're going to promote more, right. It sounds like pricing may be positive, but it's probably going to be less than you thought it was going to be and maybe that's wrong, but can you talk through that, I mean, your ability to sustain that gross margin guidance despite the fact that there seems to be more incremental drags than there are helpers to gross margin? Stephen M. Robb: Yes. So for fiscal '14, as you say we're 3 quarters into it, and gross margins in the third quarter were down about 30 basis points. We would expect gross margins to be down modestly in the fourth quarter. I think the difference in fiscal '15 around gross margins is in commodity costs. Commodity costs are running well north of 1 point this fiscal year, fiscal '14. And as we look to fiscal '15, we think commodity prices are likely to continue to trend up but not at the level we've seen. And so then when you take the cost savings programs, call it 150 basis points, and you add to that the point of pricing and the other things that we're doing, it gives us some reason to believe that our gross margins should start normalizing and start building back again. And again, we'll have to get into the year and see how things play out from a commodity standpoint but that's the assumption we're working with at this point. Steve Austenfeld : Chris, one other thing just to keep in mind is that the price increase we put through in Glad to help offset some of the commodity pressure that Steve just noted, that just went into effect in March. So we'll effectively get about a year's benefit of that going forward. Operator : Next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : So trying to dig a little bit deeper in this competitive environment that looks like it's gotten tougher. Clearly, you mentioned things like the macro environment. Are there other elements? So for example, do you guys have a sense of the manufacturing capacity utilization for the nonwoven, so for the Wipes, for resins, that's out there right now. Is that all driving some of this pressure? Stephen M. Robb: Yes, I think it's probably more retailers looking to lean into private label as a way of getting a little bit more margin than it is excess capacity chasing the system based on what we know today. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Okay. And then on that, so does it sound like -- you mentioned the price gaps in some categories up to 50%, that's not sustainable, totally makes sense. How much of that is you guys innovating over the years versus a quick change by the private label manufacturers and/or the retailers and expanding it downwards? How much of it that you guys going up versus retailers taking the prices down in private label? Donald R. Knauss: Well, it's interesting, Ali, where we've really seen private label focus is where we have branded shares north of 50%. So we look at Wipes, the most extreme pressure we've seen from private label has been in bleach, in Wipes and in Brita. And each one of those is a brand that has north of 50% share. And so when you have that kind of leadership share, I think that people really think that there certainly is a pricing or margin umbrella created, and I think that's where we've seen the most pressure. So we haven't seen that same level of pressure, for example, in salad dressing, where we even -- while we have a leadership brand, it's south of a 25% share. So it's really where we have these high share brands that we've seen the pressure, and I think sometimes \u2013 and seen in Charcoal as well with a 70%-plus share. So you think of all those businesses where we have those kinds of leadership shares, and I think you've just got to -- we've got to double down and be very prudent that we don't let that create a pricing or margin umbrella where people can crawl underneath them. But I think private label really focuses there because there's not a lot of other branded competitors to focus on. And so I think they obviously believe there's an opportunity there and certainly on the Wipes example and the 3-pack filter example on Brita and you look at lump and some of the other things that are going on in Charcoal with private label there, I think that's where you see the focus. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Okay. So this is great because this is something you guys know I struggle with because those categories are where you also have your highest margins, and so effectively it's been... Donald R. Knauss: I would stop you there and say that's not necessarily true, Ali. If you think about, all right, let's think about bleach, Wipes, Charcoal and Brita. Clearly, Brita has high margins. The other 3 are in the middle of the pack. Food has much higher margins. Burt's Bees has much higher margins. So we're not seeing it there. It's really more of the share position you have and the lack of other branded competition in those markets. And I think us just being -- needing to be much more watchful about keeping a pricing umbrella narrowed down so people can't crawl underneath it. And keeping the innovation up, keeping the innovation up so we continue to offer new offerings that people want to buy. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Okay, and that's helpful. The question I did have on -- just separate question on professional. If you could give us an update on that it sounds like that was certainly a jewel in the crown that's growing for you guys for the CAGNY presentations and before that, how is that proceeding? How is the growth going in that category? And particularly from a margin perspective is it still holding in at above company or is it trending downwards? And if you could also mention because on the M&A discussion a second ago, you mentioned a lot of other core categories. Professional used to always be your #1 it sounded like, has that shifted a little bit from an M&A priority perspective? Donald R. Knauss: Okay. On Professional, we expect another double-digit growth year out of that business, Ali. And we also expect that trend to continue in fiscal year '15. The margin structure of that is business actually accretive to the company margin structure. So we feel good about the margins in that business as well. I think that we just -- as you may recall, we talked about it at CAGNY, we just launched the UV light partnership. We think there's a lot of upside in some of these different channels and categories as we drive that business. So I think we remain very bullish on that business. As far as the -- I'll let Steve talk about the acquisition pipeline and the focus there. Stephen M. Robb: Yes. And Ali, you know that one of the things that we really like about this business is the fact that when we look at a category, it's still fairly fragmented. So we think there's an opportunity to roll up some of the small family-held businesses. Certainly, we did that with AppleCare, HealthLink and then a few years ago obviously, the Caltech bleach acquisition, which has wildly exceeded our expectations since we acquired it, and I think we feel like we've got a healthy pipeline of bolt-on acquisitions ahead of us. It's going to take some time to shake these free. They don't always come in when you want. And sometimes you have to get into long-term discussions with people, which is what we're doing, but I think we feel very good about the M&A pipeline in Professional Products, and you'll see more activity there over time. Donald R. Knauss: And we certainly -- at a 2.2 debt to EBITDA, Ali, as you know, we certainly got enough dry powder there if we need it. Operator : Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan. John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Wanted to sort of continue the theme here, and Don, you have talked a lot about product preference as something that you're really focus on in terms of getting consumer -- in terms of getting your products to where consumers really prefer them. And I guess as we look at this, you've worked hard on that and yet is it just that the consumer has changed, and that's becoming less important? And therefore, you won't be able to charge the type of premiums that you think that product preference deserves? And then you also talked a little bit about the brand investment going up, can you talk a little bit about some of your marketing mix analysis? It's continued to come up over the years that your ad to sales has moved down, should we expect the continued shift from that standpoint more toward the trade promotion? And if we do see that, is that permanent price cuts or is that going to be just sort of hitting hard at certain points of the year where you know you need to drive that value equation? Donald R. Knauss: Yes. Okay, John, let me take the second part of your question first. If you look at the incremental spend that we're putting in for next year, the majority of that spend is going into advertising and consumer promotion, not into trade. So we want to get comfortably back into the 9% to 10% range in total for the company and to get back near the 10% level for the U.S. Retail business. So that's what we're doing there. On the preference question, we still think that the 60-40 wins, the superiority of our products is extremely meaningful. I think where we got out of whack a little bit in the last year is these price premiums is only so much you can ask from a consumer especially in tough times. And I think that we did not, especially on high share brands, we did not stay focused enough on the price point delivery at the shelf. We also did not have packaging that was really hard hitting visually on what our benefit advantage is versus our competitors. At the end of the day, we've got to be able to -- as you know, we've got to be able to answer this fundamental question that consumers have. Why should I buy your brand in preference to that one? And I think while we've got great products in terms of 70-30 wins on Glad OdorShield, for example, and the same thing we have on Hidden Valley, if we let these premiums drift above 30%, we're asking too much especially in this environment. So I think we're going to continue that focus on 60-40 wins. We're going to continue to drive for price superiority, but we're getting to be damn sure that we've got these price points relevant to people where we're just not asking them to stretch too far. John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And then one sort of further follow-up on this. One of the things you guys have historically talked about is wanting to focus in categories with more private label. You talked about that strategically and I guess this kind of goes back to Nik's question, which is, is that still the right structure, the best structure for you guys to be in longer term? Those types of categories where you guys have big shares and with private label. Donald R. Knauss: Yes. I still think it is, John. I think that we still would say that if you gave us a preference to competing against private label versus competing like in Home Care with 5 different national branded and International branded companies, I think it's -- we would say yes, we'd still want to compete against private label because -- not because they're easier, but because they have a more clearly defined unique role. We each have a unique role. We're the innovator, they're the opening price point. You get into a Home Care situation where you've got 4 or 5 other multinational companies, everybody's got the same role. So I think that we want that model. We think that model works, and I think we didn't build a 60% share 1.5 years ago in Wipes, a 60%-plus share in bleach and a 70% share in Charcoal and a leadership branded share in Glad because we can't compete with private label. We've done that very well, we just got to re-sharpen ourselves in terms of making sure the balance between product superiority and price point is right. And we're getting there. And I think bleach is a good proof point of that, I think you'll see the Wipes coming back in May and June and it'll be another proof point. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Is there any share repurchase in your 2015 guidance because as Don said, I know you're sort of at the low end of your debt to EBITDA range? Stephen M. Robb: Yes. We're at about 2.2. So we certainly have dry powder for M&A, and we've got dry powder to be able to do share repurchases. What I would say is that certainly people should expect that in the outlook we're going to continue to soak up dilution from stock options. Going beyond that, I think we have to look at the M&A pipeline, and I think we just have to look at how much excess cash we build up. As we've said for many years, and I think as we've consistently done, if we build up excess cash that we don't need in the M&A environment, we'll go ahead and look for ways to get that back to the shareholders either through the dividend or through share repurchases. But at this point, there's a range of expected outcomes, and share repurchases are certainly one thing that we look at. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : And then as a follow-up to the M&A question, are there any opportunities for you guys to get bigger in sort of niche food categories? Because if you kind of look back the last 5 years probably the All-Star in the portfolio has been Hidden Valley. And you've done a terrific job extending it. I mean, is that something you'd kind of open up to be on like little small stuff like Soy Vay? Donald R. Knauss: Yes, we would be open to that, Bill. And in fact, as you say, we know how to do and compete in that category quite well. I would classify that as down the middle of the fairway for us. So clearly that is something we would be interested in. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. Are there any other sort of subcategories that you've targeted as being sort of complementary to the Hidden Valley business? Or is it too much detail? Donald R. Knauss: I think for competitive reasons, I wouldn't want to get into that one, Bill. But clearly, where you're poking at is something that we have interest in. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Got you. Great. And then just a last one, I know you still want 3 points of growth from innovation. I know you talked about the lightweight charcoal. But is there anything else you can talk about that can help drive that 3 points that's already been announced or is about to be announced? Donald R. Knauss: Well, I think, yes, I think I'll give you another example. The lip crayons for Burt's Bees that are rolling out, we think it's quite a big deal actually. There's not a 100% -- that we're aware of, there's not a 100% natural lip crayon for women out there. And as you know, lipstick is such a huge category and the lip crayon continues to push that Burt's Bees brand into beauty away from just functionality. So we think there's a big opportunity there. I think obviously the lightweight litter we think is a big opportunity. The Aloha scent, excuse me, we just launched on Glad, which is doing extremely well, which is Procter & Gamble's #2 scent on Febreze, that carries over mostly into fiscal '15. And we could go through the list by brand. But I think you're going to see a pretty full package, across every major brand we'll have news. I talked about Brita earlier. Bleach, one of the things on bleach that continues to do extremely well and we're expanding this into new scents is the Splash-less part of our portfolio, is up over 3 share points. That's one of things that's driving our overall bleach share. So Splash-less has clearly resonated with consumers. Smart Seeking, it's a little early to tell. A lot of that's carry over to next year, but all these Smart Seeking and outdoor have added in about 1 share point plus already. So I think all in all, we're feeling pretty confident in the pipeline as we go forward. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Great. And if I can just sneak in one quick other one, kind of to John Faucher's question. When you look at the kind of basis [ph] testing before you guys do these launches, are you seeing that once you launch them that the results are materially worse in this environment than they were sort of prior to this consumer malaise? Donald R. Knauss: I'm trying to think of an example, Bill, that would be even worse or much better. I can't -- I think that the models are still fairly predictive because -- and I think the reason is if you look at the category growth, now this quarter was a bit of an anomaly given, we grew 0.4% all our categories but the categories were negative 1.8% in February because of the weather. If you look at the fiscal year-to-date our categories are growing 1%. I mean, the historical average is 1% to 2%. So it's nothing like there's some massive deceleration in these categories, they're softer. And we're assuming kind of flat to up 1% next year, but I don't think there's anything dramatic going on. So I don't want to read too much into it. We haven't seen anything in the predictive models on any of the major launches that we've done that would say they're way out of whack. Operator : We'll take our next question from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital. Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: All my questions have been answered. Operator : We'll move next to our question from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: I would like to revisit this issue of the relationship with the retailers. First, a clarification, we saw a drop in ad spending in the third quarter. There was a commensurate increase in trade spending in the third quarter is what\u2026 Donald R. Knauss: Yes. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: There was? Donald R. Knauss: Yes. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: Okay. So then the question is if you can, to the extent that it's not confidential, talk about what exactly was the point of the retailer when you lose distribution for the Wipes you having 80% share? I would like to understand what is the other side of the conversation, why is it that you couldn't get into an agreement that essentially didn't \u2013 avoided this loss of distribution? That is point number one. And point number two is trade spending overall it seems like there is an increase in the Laundry aisle, there is an increase in Litter because of innovation, and most of these monies are not seen by the consumer. So is this a new normal that essentially the retailers are asking more money just to put the same products on the shelf? Donald R. Knauss: Yes. On the first question, let me see how I can answer this for you, Javier. I think what we saw in that case was an offering from a competitor that was on a cost per wipe basis. We thought that we could not replicate that price for other customers. And while we wanted certainly to maintain distribution in that customer where we had been for over a decade and had been doing quite well obviously, being the lion's share leader in share in general, we thought competing at that price level, particularly in a category where there is only 50% household penetration, we thought that was the wrong strategy for that category. And we also thought, as I said, that we could not deliver that price point to other customers. And we are a fair and equitable company in terms of allowing everyone to compete. So we just didn't think we could make it work, and we thought it would have channel repercussions that would be serious that we wouldn't be able to deal with. And we also thought it was wrong in terms of the dynamics in the category, that you didn't need to push pricing that low for a product that was on trend and had only 50% household penetration. So we chose not to go that route and told our story differently at other retailers, and that's why we're picking up distribution at other retailers. So that's to question number one. We thought it was the wrong strategy. On your second question, we have not seen an increase, that I'm aware of, in any of our top 20 customers in terms of slotting fees or any other incremental costs. Haven't seen any of that. I think people are getting even more and more everyday low cost, every day low price, pushing money into cost of goods as most they can. Certainly we have, in our top 20 customer set, high/low competitors, as well as everyday low price competitors. But I have been out with 4 retailers the last 3 weeks across the country, 4 different major retailers all in our top 20, and that has not come up at all. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: And as a follow-up, in the case of the Laundry aisle, Church & Dwight did say that they're going to increase a slotting fee or spending in trade in the trade. Donald R. Knauss: Yes. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: And my understanding is, is that there is a situation also with Procter with regards to Tide Simply with some retailers. So to what extent are you getting kind of like hurt in the crossfire or not? I mean, that, I mean, for your Laundry additives? Donald R. Knauss: Yes. We haven't really seen that, Javier. We're not really -- as you know, we don't really play much in that aisle. Well, certainly not in detergent, but the Laundry additives seem to be a separate deal, and we certainly have seen no bleed over into the bleach section. In fact, I think one of the reasons our shares are back to over 60% is we are now back to historical levels on merchandising and we're actually starting to see Household penetration decline slowing in bleach now, and dosing seems to be at the right amount. So we're not seeing that kind of effect in our segments. Operator : Our next question comes from Leigh Ferst with Wellington Shields. Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division : I also wanted to ask about the Professional Cleaning business, and I'm wondering if the infection rates are going down at the hospitals and other facilities and if not if that's still an opportunity for you? And if healthcare reform is helping drive demand? Donald R. Knauss: Yes. Leigh, on the first part of the question, clearly, the 100,000 people dying every year from hospital-acquired infections is not really moderating very much, at least we don't see a discernible trend down. We do see -- in fact, last night, I was watching NBC Nightly News and they had a segment on about MRSA and MRSA killing itself I think, it was over 23,000 people last year. So that opportunity, that issue of public health is still front and center with infection control people across acute care facilities in this country and other countries. So that continues to be a very important opportunity for us and really a really important public health issue that we could help resolve. We have seen, in tests that we've done, for example with the Mayo Clinic, where we have greatly reduced those infection levels using our products and the protocols that we recommended. So clearly, bleach is the most inexpensive and effective disinfecting agent against all those bad bugs. So that we feel good about. Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division : And is healthcare reform helping and are the protocols being followed? Donald R. Knauss: Yes, I think it's a little early to tell on that one. I think -- I'm not sure that the healthcare reform is going to materially affect that business one way or the other. I would say that one of the things that has happened under the Obama administration about 3 years ago is federal government Medicare changed the -- changed their policy that they will not -- they won't reimburse hospitals for preventable injuries, right. And they classified these acquired infections as a preventable injury. So clearly, the folks who have to deal with these protocols and infection control in hospitals are much -- even more focused on it now because of the expense of one of these, not to mention somebody potentially dying is massive. So none of that has changed, and so I think it's a very fertile opportunity for us. Operator : Your final question comes from Erin Lash with Morningstar. Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : I was wondering if you could speak a little bit about the Burt's Bees business, and I apologize if I say this wrong, but particularly within the context of how gud is performing relative to Burt's Bees in that sort of mix? Donald R. Knauss: I'm sorry. I didn't hear the last part, Erin. Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Okay. Just within the context, and I apologize if I say it incorrectly, but within the context of how gud is performing or gud is performing relative to Burt's Bees. Donald R. Knauss: Right, I got you. Well, Burt's, over 90% of our personal care business is obviously Burt's Bees. Burt's is continuing to perform extremely well. I think this will be our fourth year in a row, assuming we continue on forecast for the fourth quarter, our fourth year in a row of big double-digit growth for Burt's. The International business now doing extremely well, north of 25% growth. gud is challenged. It's a very small piece, as I said, of the business. The shampoos and conditioners seem to be hanging in there fairly well. I think distribution is challenged on the other items in that business. But clearly, Burt's is the engine that drives our personal care business and with the innovation we have coming like lip crayons, we're very bullish about FY '15 for Burt's Bees. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Knauss, I would now like to turn the conference back over to you. Donald R. Knauss: Yes. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call. I would like to just say this, I would like our investors and all of you folks who cover this company to understand that we are focused on 3 things like a laser, and I wish you'd take these away. And that is first, the value propositions of our brands and our categories is centermost in our minds. And I think the 1 point of incremental spending we're putting in next year is testimony to that. And all of that spending is going to be oriented around the guiding principle of never give consumers a reason to choose another brand. So that's number one. Number two, we're going to ensure that our cost structure is as lean as possible to provide additional fuel to reinvest in growth. So I think you all know that we have quite a track record on cost savings, and we will redouble our efforts there to ensure we've got the fuel for growth. And third, we're going to ensure that our people, who we think are the best in the business, that they can and are able to focus only on the work that the consumer is willing to pay for and get rid of a lot of this other extraneous work that doesn't really add value to the consumer or to the customer. So we're going to focus on those 3 things. Certainly, better days are ahead. But with that focus, we believe we can not only deliver on the FY '15 expectations, but hopefully in our investors' mind and yours exceed them. So with that, we look forward to talking to you in August. Take care. Operator : And thank you, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

I\u2019ll cover highlights of our fourth quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and financial outlook for fiscal \u201815 and finally, Don will close with his perspective on the business followed by Q&A. So, starting with the fourth quarter, including the impact of negative foreign currencies, sales decreased to 2% and volume was flat. On a currency-neutral basis, sales grew 1.5 of a percentage point. The fourth quarter reflected many factors we have seen in recent quarters. Price increases taken mostly in international market were more than offset by nearly three points of negative foreign currency impact primarily from Argentina and Venezuela as well as higher merchandising support to drive share and category growth. For the fiscal year volume was flat and sales were down about 1.5 percentage point again reflecting the impact of unfavorable foreign rates and higher merchandising support. On a currency-neutral basis, full year sales were up nearly 2% about in line with our most recent outlook. Positively we delivered 3 percentage points of top-line growth from innovation with the third consecutive fiscal year consistent with our long-term strategic target. In the fourth quarter, our U.S. 13-week market share decrease of three tenths of a points versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting continued intense competitive activity. This slight decline is consistent with results in recent quarters. The luggage market share gains in the quarter versus the year ago quarter were gains on a Kingsford charcoal and Laundry businesses which were more than offset by decreases in our Cat Litter, Brita and Glad businesses. Our categories were about flat in the fourth quarter and category growth for the full fiscal year remain just below our 20-20 strategy assumption of at least one point of annual category growth. Improving our category trends and market shares remains our top 1 priority. With that I will review our fourth quarter results by segment. Starting with our Cleaning segment fourth quarter volume was flat and sales were down 1%, driven by decreases in our Laundry business due to the lower shipments of Clorox 2, Stain Remover and Color Booster which saw continued category softness and reduced merchandising activity. Volume on Clorox Bleach was up behind market share increases and the introduction of Clorox Smart Seek Bleach. With our return to national merchandising following the concentration of Clorox Bleach last year we have now grown share in the last two quarters. In Home Care which is our largest domestic business unit, our sales were essentially flat, this reflected lower volume on wipes business offset by very strong performance across the rest of the cleaning portfolio. On wipes we continue to face an intensely competitive environment, which as we noted last quarter resulted in a loss distribution at a major club customer. In response we are increasing investment in 3D demand building including increased consumer promotions, consumer communication across TV, radio and digital highlighting the value of Clorox\u2019s wipes versus competitor products, high levels of quality merchandising and recently launched wipes products for glass, bathtub and shower cleaning. Recently we\u2019ve also seen meaningful distribution gains of several retailers. As we finished the fourth quarter Clorox remains the clear leader in the wipes category with market shares remaining near 50% interact channels and with share trends improving. We\u2019re optimistic this trend will continue. Finally, volume and sales gains on a professional products business were driven by higher shipments of cleaning products. Looking ahead for the overall Cleaning segment we continue to expect heightened competitive pressures, which we are aggressively responding to with increased investments to drive brand and category growth. In our Household segment, volume and sales decreased 2%. The segment\u2019s top-line results were largely driven by lower shipments of Glad trash products due to a March price increase. As anticipated advanced purchases of Glad products ahead of the price increase reduced shipments in the fourth quarter. However, due to excellent execution at retail our volume and market share performance was better than anticipated. To-date branded competition has generally followed our price increase although at a somewhat slower pace, our private labor response remains mixed across retailers. Due to sustained higher resin prices, we anticipate competitors will eventually raise pricing at the shelf. Cat Litter volume sales and share decreases resulted continued intense competitive pressures. In response, we are investing more aggressively to reverse market share declines and looking forward to this month\u2019s launch of Fresh Step extreme lightweight. A lightweight Cat Litter product with excellent clumping and odor control that Fresh Step consumers have come to expect from our premium Cat Litters. And finally our Charcoal business gained market share and grew strongly behind favorable spring weather, strong merchandising support and outstanding sales execution. Turning to our Lifestyle segment, volume and sales in the segment increased 2% primarily due to strong gains in Burt\u2019s Bees behind new face care products and the launch of new lip crayons which are off to a very good start. Shipments of Brita products grew behind strong merchandising support although Brita sales were down due to incremental demand building investment. Water filtration category remains soft and our shares decreased due to competitive activity. We anticipate meaningful innovation on our Brita business in the first half of fiscal year 2015, we hope to reserve market share declines. In our food business volume was flat. Sales were up solidly due to reduced trade promotion spending. We look forward to introducing additional new food items in fiscal year \u201815. Turning to international our performance in the quarter was similar to what we experienced in the first three quarters of the fiscal year. Namely, volume growth was more than offset by foreign currency declines. In the fourth quarter volume growth of 1% and positive pricing of nearly five points was more than offset by 14 percentage points of negative foreign exchange impacts, primarily from Argentina and Venezuela which resulted in an 8% decrease in sales. Steve will provide further details on Venezuela and Argentina in a moment. On a currency-neutral basis international sales grew a healthy 6%. Across our international markets, our market shares remains healthy but we have recently seen a modestly slower growth rate in some countries. With the exception of Venezuela and Argentina we\u2019re continuing to invest in demand building initiatives and innovation to support category growth. As we close the year we remain committed to growing our categories and market shares to strong brand investment and clearly demonstrating the value of our products, the value our products provide to consumers across the 3Ds. Looking at fiscal year \u201815 we continue to anticipate sales to be about flat with growth from innovation offset by ongoing softness in the company\u2019s U.S. retail categories and foreign currency declines. On a currency-neutral basis we anticipate total company sales to grow in the range of 1% to 3%. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our fiscal year \u201814 performance and outlook for fiscal year \u201815. Stephen Robb : Well, thanks Steve and welcome everyone. In the fourth quarter, the company delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of a $1.30 versus a $1.38 in the year ago quarter. This quarter\u2019s earnings per share results reflect $20 million of incremental demand building investments as we stepped up our efforts to revitalize our categories and grow our market shares. While it\u2019s going to take time to realize the full impact of our investments we began to see improving share trends in the fourth quarter. As we look to the fiscal year 2015, investing in our brands and categories remains a tough priority. Now I\u2019ll review our fourth quarter and fiscal year results in more detail and then discuss our outlook for fiscal year \u201815. In our fourth quarter, sales were down 2%, reflecting nearly three points of negative foreign currency impact and about a one point higher trade promotions spending, partially offset by the benefit of nearly two points of pricing. On a currency-neutral basis, sales grew a 0.5 percentage point. Gross margin for the quarter declined a 170 basis points to 42.3% compared to 44% in the year ago quarter. The biggest factors contributing to the gross margin decline were about 240 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs and about a 110 basis point of higher commodity costs. For perspective, included in this quarter\u2019s manufacturing and logistics costs increases were more than a 100 basis points of one-time expenses, including higher supply chain costs in order to meet stronger than anticipated customer demand for our charcoal products. These factors were partially offset by about a 110 basis points of cost savings and about 80 basis points of pricing. In the fourth quarter, the company invested in incremental $11 million in advertising spending, an increase of more than 8% versus the year ago quarter to more than 9% of sales reflecting strong support behind our brands. Importantly our U.S. retail advertising was nearly 10% of sales. Selling and administrative expenses were lower in the fourth quarter due to reduced employee incentive compensation accruals, reflecting significantly lower year-over-year payouts consistent with our pay for performance philosophy. Selling and administrative costs also benefited about a $8 million of cost savings. As anticipated our tax rate of 34.1% from continuing operations was up about 2.5 points in the quarter versus year ago, largely due to favorable tax settlements in the year ago period. For the fourth quarter, we delivered diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of a $1.30, a 6% decrease versus the year ago quarter. Next I\u2019ll turn to our results for the full year. Sales declined about 0.5 percentage point in fiscal year \u201814 reflecting more than two points of impact from unfavorable foreign currencies and about a 0.5 percentage point of higher trade promotion spending. Price increases contributed about 1.5 points to sales. On a currency-neutral basis sales grew nearly 2%. For the year, gross margin was down about 70 basis points to 42.2% compared to 42.9% in fiscal year \u201813 reflecting about a 160 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs and about a 120 basis points of increased commodity costs. These factors were partially offset by about a 140 basis points of cost savings and about 80 basis points of pricing. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for the full year were down 70 basis points at 13.7% compared to 14.4% in fiscal year \u201813, primarily driven by a reduction in employee incentive compensation accruals. We expect selling and administrative expenses to be slightly higher in fiscal year \u201815 about 14% of sales which is consistent with our long-term target. Our target also assumes incentive compensation will return to more normal levels. Advertising spending for the fiscal year was 9% of sales, a slight increase versus the year ago period, reflecting reductions in challenged markets such as Argentina and Venezuela, offset by continued incremental support for our domestic brands and categories. Our U.S. retail spending was nearly 10% of sales. Our effective tax rate of 34.7% on earnings from continuing operations was up two points versus fiscal year \u201813 reducing diluted earnings per share by $0.13. Free cash flow for the fiscal year increased by $50 million to $633 million or 11% of sales versus $583 million or 10% of sales in fiscal \u201813. This increase was primarily the result of lower capital expenditures in fiscal \u201814. In fiscal \u201815, we anticipate free cash flow as a percentage of net sales to be about 10%. Now consistent with our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, we repurchased about $3 million shares in fiscal year \u201814 for about $260 million. We also increased our dividend by 4% in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.0 at the low end of our target range of 2 to 2.5, reflecting solid cash flow we had in the fiscal year. As we mentioned in our press release, the company\u2019s fiscal year diluted earnings per share results were negatively affected by the macroeconomic challenges in Venezuela, including a $0.14 charge related to the effective currency devaluation. The result of the company using the SICAD I currency exchange system beginning in March of 2014. In addition, continued high inflation and government imposed price controls have resulted in sustained operating losses for the company\u2019s Venezuela business. Net of all of the factors I have discussed today in fiscal year 2014, we delivered diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.26 a decrease of 1% versus the previous year. Now I\u2019ll turn to our fiscal year 2015 outlook. As Steve mentioned, our fiscal year outlook continues to anticipate sales will be about flat due to continuing headwinds of category softness and foreign currency declines. Excluding the negative impact of nearly three percentage points from currency declines particularly in Argentina and Venezuela, we continue to anticipate sales growth of 1% to 3%. As we mentioned last quarter, sales are expected to be lower in the first half of the fiscal year since we anticipate foreign currency declines to be higher in that period. As a reminder, we won\u2019t anniversary the meaningful devaluations in Argentina and Venezuela seen earlier this calendar year until the second half of the fiscal year. Sales should also be stronger in the second half as we anticipate seeing the benefits from our incremental trade and consumer demand building investments. Finally, our sales outlook includes the benefits of some price increases primarily in international as well as product innovation which is anticipated to contribute three percentage points of incremental sales growth. Our fiscal year 2015 outlook also continues to assume the ability to increase prices in Venezuela. However, we have not yet received pricing relief on our controlled products. As we mentioned last quarter, price controls have been imposed on more than two-thirds of our portfolio for nearly three years. During that time manufacturing costs have more than doubled due to sustained high inflation and our Venezuela business has been operating a loss for more than 18 months. Since the economic environment in Venezuela continues to deteriorate, we are considering all of our options. Turning to EBIT margin, we continue to anticipate fiscal year 2015 EBIT margin to increase 25 to 50 basis points reflecting moderate gross margin expansion partially offset by incremental investments and demand building programs to help grow our categories and defend our shares. Given the headwinds we\u2019ve mentioned we anticipate more downward pressure in gross margin in the first half of fiscal year. We also continue to anticipate selling and administrative expenses will be about 14% of sales. We also continue to anticipate an effective tax rate of 34% to 35% in fiscal 2015. And all of these factors we continue to anticipate earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.50. As I mentioned last quarter, this outlook assumes continued double-digit currency devaluations in both Argentina and Venezuela. Notwithstanding the challenges we faced in fiscal \u201814, I am pleased we delivered another strong year of cost savings. I also feel good about the company\u2019s strong cash flow even in a tough year we generated more than 700 million in cash to invest and return to our shareholders. And as I mentioned we\u2019re planning incremental investments to support our categories and profitably grow market shares in fiscal year 2015. With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Don. Donald Knauss : Okay. Thanks Steve and hello everyone on the call. As I reflect on fiscal year \u201814 obviously was a challenging year not only for us but I think the industry in general and our results were significantly impacted as we\u2019ve talked about by the negative impact of foreign currencies about 2.5 points there, price controls in the high inflation markets and softness in our U.S. retail business as people spend more to be competitive and take dollars out of the category and force the commodity cost increases which we do see mitigating somewhat in fiscal \u201815. Now, while we\u2019re disappointed with those results, I mean a pretty tough environment out there. I do feel good about the progress we\u2019re making on our priorities to build back market share get our categories back growing again and get on course to achieve the 20-20 strategy targets. As we said many times and we talked about this in October at the Analyst Day out in pleasant and we\u2019re focused on three growth pillars, our U.S. retail business which is about 75% of our business, our professional products business which makes up about 5% and then of course international which contributes about 20%. Let me take you through a little bit of performance review against those three legs of our stool. So, starting with U.S. retail, as has been mentioned FY14 sales were about flat with lower sales of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes due to the loss of distribution as Steve noted that one of our key club customers. That was offset by gains in the charcoal business. Now that said, we\u2019re going to continue to invest behind our brands as Steve just noted we\u2019ve invested nearly 10% of U.S. retail sales in advertising and sales promotion with total company spending for advertising and sales promotion over our target of 9%. Now for the total company we met our innovation goal with three points of incremental consolidated sales from new products. I think both Steve have talked about the fact that growing market share in categories are the top priorities in this company and we\u2019re investing heavily in demand creation to improve the consumer value propositions we have out there. That\u2019s why Steve noted, we spend an incremental $20 million in demand spending in the fourth quarter. Now, in FY14 we\u2019ve also enhanced those 3D tools which will play off benefit in \u201815 as well. It\u2019s going to help balance our return on investment among base innovation adjacencies, pricing, trade spending and advertising and sales promotion spending. We\u2019re also focused on improving advertising and packaging with harder hitting claims to make the benefits of our brand stand out at shelf and I think we\u2019re starting to see the benefits of that for example with bleach returning back to share growth. And as I noted in Q4 we increased our demand building investment by $20 million versus the same year ago quarter. As I said that approach is starting to work, we\u2019re starting to see those trends improve on bleach as we promised and we\u2019re also seeing on Clorox Disinfecting Wipes. We just received the July data which is public and now we\u2019re seeing about nine tenths of a share point gain in July on wipes and two tenths of a share point gain for the three months ending July. So we feel good about promises made promises kept in terms of bleach and wipe shares returning to growth. So, I\u2019m turning to professional products, we delivered 8% sales growth in fiscal \u201814 that was driven by strong results in cleaning and healthcare partially offset by the impact of a fairly mild cold and flu season. We continue to make good progress here as well with new product innovation and partnerships. In the area of surface disinfection we obtained soft surface sanitation claims for hydrogen peroxide sprays. That\u2019s enabling us to pioneer some new usage educations in healthcare and another commercial channels. And I think as many of you know, we finalized a partnership for the Clorox Optimal UV system becoming the first CPG company out there that focuses on healthcare to provide both a surface disinfected as well as UV technology. We\u2019ve got a strong pipeline of professional product innovation plan for \u201815 and anticipate a strong year consistent with our long range growth targets of 10% to 15% in that business for this fiscal year. We continue to believe there are tailwinds in that space and that we do have a differentiated right to win. We\u2019re going to seek to grow our base business with a focus on M&A as well and you\u2019ll see us expanding organically through products and category adjacencies. Our international sales were down 4% for the full fiscal year and we\u2019re about 11 percentage points of unfavorable foreign exchange impact in numerous markets but as noted this was obviously most significant in Argentina and Venezuela. On a currency-neutral basis our sales internationally grew 7%. As we said in our press release, the economic environment in Venezuela continues to worsen and we are considering all of our options there. In international as a whole we\u2019re taking the right actions to drive profitable growth in and beyond Latin America and during the fiscal year we focused on the global expansion of Burt\u2019s Bees which continues grow strongly in the internationally markets. We also continue to build out adjacencies in the Middle East and North Africa with the launch of new products across the region continuing growth in cleaners and expansions in the new country. So, in closing I would say this, look I am feeling very good about setting the organization up for success in \u201815 and beyond. \u201814 was a disappointing year but it was a catalyst for change. And these are the changes that are going to ensure that our brands have the necessary support to regain share and top-line momentum. And as I said I think we\u2019ve got a couple of proved points out there on Clorox Bleach and Disinfecting Wipes. Our increased spending last quarter and throughout fiscal \u201815 will ensure we continue to be very competitive in the marketplace and that spending is going to be focused on harder hitting advertising and packaging claims that can show the consumers the value of our brands in plain English or plain Spanish or any other country we\u2019re competing in. So, in addition, our continued focus on cost savings and our agile enterprise initiatives is going to ensure our cost structure continues to be very competitive and that our demand spending increases are sustained overtime. So, these increases are now being built into our base. And lastly our long-term focus on total shareholder returns is still at the center of everything we do. And I think strong evidence of that focus as Steve noted is the free cash flow we achieved in fiscal \u201814. The Clorox is fundamentally healthy. We\u2019ve got great brands, we\u2019ve got great people. We know what to do to be competitive in this environment and we\u2019re ensuring \u2013 and to the fact that we ensure our shareholders benefit from that and we\u2019re on it. And with that we\u2019ll open up for questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Knauss. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Jason English \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Quick sort of housekeeping item. Can you give us the magnitude of the incentive compensation cuts back at the envelope I am getting to around $40 million maybe headwind next year to reload that\u2019s almost $0.20 of EPS. Is that on the right ballpark. Stephen Robb : That is right. That\u2019s a pretty close number in terms of the headwind that we\u2019ve got it\u2019s actually a little bit higher than that but that\u2019s pretty close. Jason English \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Thanks for that. And then Don a question for you in terms of brand building A&P support, you run it right at the very bottom of that 9% to 10% target and if we look at A&MP it really hasn\u2019t sort of barged in the last four or five years you\u2019re suffering weaker categories share hasn\u2019t been great. Do you see a need to kind of really up the investment here and throw more money at it to try to get this going? Donald Knauss : Yeah. I think we do Jason and I think one of the prove points is that $20 million that\u2019s now in the base for the fourth quarter then the additional more than $30 million we\u2019ve added incrementally into fiscal \u201815. I would say this to Jason we compete in some categories where private label is the primary competitor. We have brands that are spending north of 15% in terms of marketing consumer promotion and advertising spend. So we get a little bit lost in the averages here. But to answer your question, clearly there is significantly more support in the fourth quarter of \u201814 and throughout \u201815. That will be baked into the base as we go forward. We\u2019re striving to get an additional full point and as we go towards the 20-20 strategy. And I would say that in those categories where we compete primarily was private label. We\u2019ve got a 100% share of voice. And we\u2019re seeing two of those three categories now we\u2019re private label as loss share in the last quarter. So bleach we\u2019ve gained share of two quarters in a row, private label is loss share, charcoal we\u2019re gaining share again private label losing share. To add we\u2019ve lost some share but we\u2019re finally seeing private label come up and start to match the price increase. So yes, a lot more spending going on if you will and we\u2019re putting it on those brands that needed the most. Jason English \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Got it, thanks a lot. I\u2019ll pass it on. Donald Knauss : Okay. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Powers of UBS. Stephen Powers \u2013 UBS Investment Bank : I guess on the same them, Steve or Don I guess of your total demand building spend at this point. Roughly how much is devoted to advertising versus trade spend and how is that changed over the years or it has? Donald Knauss : That ratio Steve is fairly even although it\u2019s probably in the 45-55 range in terms of 40 I\u2019d say low 40s to mid-40s on advertising and consumer promotion and the rest being trade. Stephen Robb : Yeah let me just build on Don\u2019s comments. We spend about a $0.5 billion a year in advertising and consumer promotion. We spent a bit more than that as you would imagine on the trade spending they go through. So I call it a 60-40, 70-30 split with an emphasis on trade. I think importantly as you look forward to fiscal \u201815, you will see us ramp up the level of demand building investment. We\u2019re going to focus that investment on the vehicles and offer the highest returns. So you\u2019ll likely to see some of that flow into trade spending and some of that flow into advertising and consumer promotions. Stephen Powers \u2013 UBS Investment Bank : Okay. Thank you for that. And I guess shifting gears towards Venezuela which you commented upon maybe Argentina as well any updates there. But Venezuela specifically, can you just define a bit more about how much pricing you\u2019ve assumed and if you can or can either way. In your respect of the as the likelihood of pricing gone up down or remain unchanged since April. So I guess sense for your comment at some point, if you don\u2019t get the pricing kind of what the magnitude to your guidance would be or whether or even would come to that it sounds like you\u2019re open to that as you say kind of all options. So at what point would you just decide to exit altogether. Stephen Robb : Okay there is a lot of questions embedded in there. Let me take a try at this. So first, as a reminder Venezuela in terms of sales is a little less than 2% of our sales. Looking forward, based on the most recent devaluation that we saw earlier than this calendar year, I would say the business is probably about a little more than 1% of the company sales. We are losing money in Venezuela as I\u2019ve said for quite some time. I think we\u2019re reaching, rapidly reaching the point where we just have to get pricing. You cannot have double-digit inflation going year-after-year and not get some level of pricing. We certainly requested the pricing, I think we\u2019ve had a constructive dialogue about that pricing. But the reality is we haven\u2019t got anything yet and I think we\u2019ve reached the point with the deterioration of the economic environment, the lack of pricing where all options are on the table. I don\u2019t want to get into the level of pricing, it has been assumed at this point or speculate on what the company may or may not do. Other than to say that we will always do what\u2019s in the best interest of our shareholders, but I think it\u2019s prudent at this point to look at all of the options and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing. Donald Knauss : And let me add a little more color to the Steve too. I think in some ways Clorox is a bit uniquely disadvantage in Venezuela. When I look at other CPG companies in Venezuela I can\u2019t find another one where almost two-thirds of their portfolio has been under price controls for almost three years. So it puts us in a bit of a unique spot. I would say to your question do we feel more optimistic, less optimistic? Three months ago we felt more optimistic. We had verbal commitments on pricing in early June that pricing has not been published as of today. That pricing was near what we had requested and I think what other companies have requested. I think the government understands the situation we are in and other companies are in that in Venezuela. But as Steve said, given the operating loss we\u2019ve sustained there over the last 18 months, this cannot go on too much longer before we have to take a decision on what we ultimately do with that business. But I would say today, based on the performance or based on the lack of publishing of that pricing that was verbally agreed to. I\u2019d say I\u2019m more pessimistic than I am optimistic about getting that pricing. Stephen Powers \u2013 UBS Investment Bank : Okay, thanks a lot. That\u2019s very helpful. Donald Knauss : Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Olivia Tong of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch : Thanks. On cost savings 110 basis points still solid clearly, but that\u2019s a bit like relative to your typical run rate and you obviously reiterated next year. But what caused the deceleration and the cost savings progression and did you already expect that. Stephen Robb : Yeah so Olivia actually we\u2019re coming off of a record cost savings here in fiscal \u201814. The 100 basis points that you\u2019re referencing is the cost savings that flow through gross margin for the quarter. If I just step back and I look at the year, we delivered probably two full points of margin improvement from the cost savings program. Now about a 140 basis points of that flow through of the gross margin but we also had some additional cost savings flow through selling and administrative expenses and other lines of the P&L. So there has not been a deceleration of the cost savings program, the savings are just flowing in different parts of the P&L. I would also just echo that looking forward we continue to feel very good about the 150 basis points of cost savings. Although again as I\u2019ve said many times before, we\u2019re going to look at every line of the P&L. Some of that will go through the gross margin probably with most of it but some can also flow through other lines of the P&L including our SG&A costs. Donald Knauss : Olivia the one other thing I would point out is the fourth quarter for us is our largest sales quarter of the year. So although dollar amounts can vary by quarter. You could have consistent dollar performance from a cost saving standpoint in the fourth quarter but have lower basis point benefit just because of the higher sales. Olivia Tong \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch : Got it, that\u2019s really helpful. And then in terms of the businesses. Cleaning it looks like it actually rebounded a bit relative to where you stood in Q3. But households swung down. So how much of that would you attribute to Glad pricing which it just takes a bit of time for that to sort of flow through and you\u2019ll see some buying degradation in the interim versus something that\u2019s a little bit more systemic like the Cat Litter under performance. Donald Knauss : Olivia I think you picked up on it. A great portion of the decline in household was due to Glad. And I think I mentioned in my comments, that was something we\u2019d anticipated, we checked the price increase in March. We saw a little bit of accelerated purchases from our retail customers and so coming into the quarter we knew that Glad volume would be down. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see that continue to same extent as we move into fiscal \u201815. Stephen Robb : I think Olivia now that we\u2019ve seen pricing at some of our largest customers being matched from our branded competition as well as private label starting to move up in most customers. I think we\u2019ll see the glad volume decline start to mitigate now. And in the quarter Charcoal almost offset the entire Glad decline. So I think they\u2019ve played kind of a counter balance, but I think we feel more bullish going forward that the pricing is starting to get matched. Olivia Tong \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch : Got it, and then just lastly in light of Procter\u2019s announcement this morning about pairing back their portfolio. Can you remind us what your M&A priorities are other than obviously getting bigger in the professional business. Are there certain categories that you are more interested in and of course we know about the professional but in the consumer facing business. Thank you. Stephen Robb : So we continue to be interested as you said in professional we think that\u2019s an attractive space. We\u2019re also interested in U.S. centric consumer packaged goods companies. We love natural personal care we think that\u2019s interesting. We did a very small acquisition obviously in food additives [sweetening] which is a sauce. So I think any of these mid-sized categories that have good tailwinds attractive margins, U.S. centric would be particularly attractive for us. So, certainly as they look to divest brands it will be something that we take a hard look at as a company to see if there is something that we might be able to extract cost synergies on and accelerate the growth of the company win. Olivia Tong \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch : Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Donald Knauss : Thanks Olivia. Operator : The next question is from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein Research. Ali Dibadj \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.: Hey guys. So you and a lot of your CPG players do you have a common theme of incremental demand building some people call it different things, the incremental demand building. And I\u2019m trying to understand underneath it why is that necessary right now so clearly there are many drivers consumer macro other competition rates of the bottom type stuff. So just trying to understand why number one. And then how do you think about the returns you\u2019re getting from the incremental demand building both trade and advertising. And Don maybe if you could chime in at some point about that question given your past experiences in carbonated soft drinks and there I think, they are starting to realize that you got to push more on price mix collectively because the volume just isn\u2019t there and I wonder sometimes especially with your private label competition, why that isn\u2019t that going to be more of the case here or to? Donald Knauss : Yeah. Let me start Ali and then I\u2019ll ask Steve to jump in as well. I think why it\u2019s necessary I think is to get stronger communication and delivery at shelf on the value of our brands quite frankly I mean we\u2019re calling FY15 for example the year of value for Clorox. And when you look at the value communication, the fact is what we\u2019re doing is an effective job of that like in bleach amount for example like we\u2019ve done in Hidden Valley even though it\u2019s largely most our highly priced premium product we have. We see the positive share results I think the other thing is why it\u2019s so, one reason is just the consumers empowerment if you will and the consumers ability to understand what the best value is out there, and we\u2019ve got to be competitive with that value communication and value delivery at the shelf. The other thing is in the last year or year and a half, we\u2019ve seen a lot more competitive intensity in the U.S market as other multinationals have been focused on this market. So just the level of competitive intensity is there. Third, I think the retailers need to get traffic into the stores, they continue to push their own retail brands harder. So to be competitive, I think the branded manufacturers have to push their innovation harder and push their own marketing harder as well. So it\u2019s kind of a combination of all those reasons that we think it\u2019s necessary and you know we\u2019ve got and I think this is true of most of our competitors we\u2019ve got a pretty sophisticated return of investment models that give us a really good indication of we\u2019re going to getting a return on that investment or not. So I think, but those are the three reasons that I see all day out there, why that incremental spending is necessary and I don\u2019t think when I think about our spending relative to our competitors, I think we\u2019ve been very efficient with our spending anyway. Stephen Robb : I would just echo Don\u2019s comments and say if you go back to the 20-20 strategy we had as a company, one of the things we indicated that we wanted to do was to spend an incremental point of sales in our demand building investment programs. I think what we\u2019ve seen over the last years we\u2019re just going to accelerate that so we\u2019re going to put that point in a little bit faster and a little bit harder than we had originally anticipated, but we\u2019ve got very sophisticated tools, we know that when we put a certain amount into trade, we get a pretty nice lift and when you start to emphasize things like feature and display and doing those things together the brands tend to respond very well. The advertising it\u2019s getting a lot harder hitting, we\u2019ve got some pretty good score in advertising that we\u2019re bringing to market and we think again investing behind that makes sense. So these are smart investments they are consistent with our long-term goals and objectives and I think we feel very good about. Ali Dibadj \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.: So this is helpful because I always wonder about the marking ROI sophistication, are sophisticated. I am not as sophisticated and all I look at reported results and I don\u2019t see it right so I\u2019m just kind of? Donald Knauss : Well, let me give you a few proof points Ali because I think we do have a few. If you look at Bleach we said over a year ago that we would get back to Bleach share growth I mean clearly in the last two quarters we have seen share growth return. We said the same thing on Wipes we said once we got into the June, July period we\u2019d start to see share growth. We\u2019ve had much harder hitting advertising on Wipes, comparative advertising on Wipes and on Bleach. And our packaging is much more declarative on our Wipes business and our Bleach business. So I think where we\u2019re making this focus I think we\u2019re starting to see the share growth that we promised our investors that they would, that we deliver. So I think there is a proof points out there, I think another one is Charcoal, I mean we amped up the spending there and we started to see share growth come back in the Kingsford brand as well. So I think there is a proof points out there that say it\u2019s working. Ali Dibadj \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And two quick ones. All in one manufacturing logistic costs, can you give us a little bit more detail about that being negative 240 and then I guess the 100 which is the one time on Charcoal, so any details there and then I know it\u2019s Green Works pricing up 21%, I\u2019m just curious about that? Thank you. Stephen Robb : Well let me start with the manufacturing and logistics cost, because the fourth quarter gross margin was a bit disappointing in one of the biggest surprises I think for us is and it\u2019s a good news, bad news story. Good news is our Charcoal business was a whole lot stronger than we had anticipated, but to meet that consumer demand and what the retailers were asking for we had to redeploy a lot of inventory across the United States and we encouraged some incremental manufacturing costs that cost us a little over employed. We\u2019re happy to have the growth, we\u2019re happy to have the business, we should hadn\u2019t hurt gross margin as much as it did, but it\u2019s really as one time in nature. And I certainly think as we look at our gross margins on a go forward basis, I would not have people take this 240 basis points of manufacturing cost and project that forward. I think it will continue to be a headwind but it\u2019s going to be a headwind consistent with what we\u2019ve seen, which is probably a bit north of a point, but certainly not the level we saw on the fourth quarter. Donald Knauss : On Green Works Ali, we\u2019ve had one of our national top 10 mass customers really recommit to that brand and starting in July, we\u2019ve got depending on the region of that customer, we\u2019ve got 10 to 12 new use SKUs of Green Works into that account. And we think that accounts customers line up perfectly with the Green Works brand consumers as well. So we expect good things out of that so that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing is that initial bump as we go into that customer in a big way. Ali Dibadj \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.: Thanks very much. Donald Knauss : Okay. Operator : The next question is from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank. William Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG : Hi. Good morning. Donald Knauss : Hello Bill. William Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG : Hey on the S&A side I know you guys are 14% of sales in 2015. Why isn\u2019t that coming down because obviously question before but you know it\u2019s just a function of lower sales growth I know you\u2019ve all this rate ongoing productivity programs in place, but it sort of stay stubbornly in that 14% level? And then I have a follow up. Donald Knauss : Yeah. I think if you go back a couple of years Bill I am actually feeling very good about the discipline we\u2019ve applied to our SG&A cost because at one point I think just a few years ago it\u2019s about 14.6% of sales fiscal \u201813 I remember it was 14.4% obviously this year we got down to 13.7%, but there is two challenges we face as you look at fiscal \u201815. Number one is we\u2019re going to bring these compensation accruals ideally the comp programs payout closer to target levels. So that\u2019s going to put some upward pressure on SG&A cost. The other challenge is just inflation particularly in some of our international markets. Now all of that said we feel very good about the cost savings programs and the productivity programs and so we think that should enable us to offset some of these and net-net we should be at about 14% in fiscal \u201815. And our goal is to get as you know is to get there to 14% ideally less and then take some of those savings and reinvest it back in the business. So I would say we\u2019re very much on track with a multi-year plan to get this to 14% or less. Donald Knauss : Bill I think having to reinstate north of $40 million in incentive comp puts a big rock to hurdle and so I think when you think about it going from 13.7% to 14% that\u2019s about $15 million of increase and we\u2019re offsetting over $40 million of comp. So you can rest assure there is some real productivity in there. William Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG : Got it. No, that\u2019s helpful. And then can you just clarify on the Wipe side you said market share was up, was that just Nielsen or is that include some of your panel data on cost gong some of the club stores? Stephen Robb : The nine tenths of a share point gain Bill was in the multi-outlet data, we get are syndicated data which covered about 81% of our volume. So yeah it was a syndicated data. William Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG : Got you. If you do a stab at that I am sure get \u2013 the panel data sort of back in I mean is it flat, is it up you know if you included everything in Wipes? Donald Knauss : Yeah it\u2019s hard to say we\u2019ve made up about 35% of anything we lost in that one customer already. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re probably flattish to down slightly if you add them back in, we\u2019ll see how they net out on that experiment as we get through the rest of this year. But what has happened is we\u2019ve picked up distribution in a number of key customers and so that\u2019s enabled us as I said to replace about 35% of what we lost in the first five months or already five months into this, we\u2019ve replaced about 35% of it but on the 81% that\u2019s covered we\u2019re feeling very good about almost the full share point of growth. The interesting thing to Bill if you look at the data if another folks look at the data as we gained share back in the Wipes category the category growth rate accelerates and I think that\u2019s what the retailers are looking at. So for example if you look at the last 52 weeks the category this is ending July the category was up about 13 weeks as we started to gain share it\u2019s up almost 6. So as we gained shared and get back into the game so to speak the category accelerates which you would expect when you get almost a 50 share brand its premium priced. William Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG : Got you. And then you guys historically when a brand is troubled you sort of when you promised to fix do you fixed it so would you commit to turning Cat Litter around and gaining market share over the next 12 months? Donald Knauss : Yeah. That\u2019s certainly in our croziers Bill is that by the time we get into the second half of the fiscal year we want to see much more positive share gain, stabilizing share gains on Litter. I think the initiative with Lightweight starting to ship into two weeks and then you\u2019re going to see revised packaging, you\u2019re also going to see a lot more, what I guess I would call little eye innovation on Litter as we go forward. So, clearly as we get into the second half of \u201815 we expect to see some real improvements in those share results on Litter. And you know it\u2019s interesting Bill to about 45% of our share loss on Litter in Fresh Step in one customer so, we are on it. William Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG : Okay, great. And then Steve on last one so the leverage ratios are in two turns now I mean it seems like there is not a lot of do really with the cash so, are you contend letting that ratio continue to lied down? Stephen Robb : We are going to continue build on what we have been doing which I trying to be disciplined with the allocation of cash. Today what we have been doing last year we had bought $260 million back of shares and obviously increase the dividend 4% I think you will continue to see us focus on keeping a healthy dividend we will probably periodically go back into the market and repurchase shares for no other reasons and then just to offset stock option dilution I think beyond that if cash builds up I am going to look for ways to get that back to the shareholders, the one thing I would remind everyone we do have $575 million worth of debt coming due in January of 2015 so, that\u2019s also something we need to plan for and think for over the next six months. William Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG : Great, thank you so much. Donald Knauss : Thanks Bill. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Ferrara of Wells Fargo. Christopher Ferrara \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities : Hey, guys can you I am sorry if you did already but can you just talk about for what fiscal \u201815 what you think the breakout will be on the organic sales between the volume and price? Stephen Robb : We do expect we haven\u2019t actually given that specific breakdown but would say that we are expecting positive volume growth in the year and we are expecting a modest level of pricing primarily coming at of our international markets to deal with some of the higher inflationary environments. We did fix some pricing earlier this calendar year on Glad we took about a 6% price increase that I think as Don and Steve had mentioned we have seen certainly the branded folks have followed, private label looks like they are beginning to. So, I think you are going to see a mix but certainly we are expecting positive volume growth more leaning towards the second half of the fiscal year as we get more traction on some of the demand building investments and the innovation. Christopher Ferrara \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities : Got it. Thanks. And I guess on other note last quarter you ran the one-time balance sheet devaluation like the balance sheet charge, write down of asset charge that happened from the Venezuela and deval through your core numbers right to get to the 106. And I guess I know you are assuming SICAD 1 for 15 but you are not necessarily assuming SICAD 1 stays at 11. But I guess the question do you have incremental balance sheet devaluation running through your P&L baked into the fiscal \u201815 guidance? Stephen Robb : Yeah, so without getting in again too much detail because there is a lot of synergies that we\u2019ve obviously run here what I would say is that we are assuming number one that we continue to use SICAD 1 as the exchange rate mechanism and then second, we expect that there will be as you say ongoing devaluation what we have not assumed in the outlook is that we got to SICAD 2 which again from a perspective SICAD 1 is at about 10.8, SICAD 2 is closer to 50 so, expect them to devalue SICAD 1 but we expect it to happen over the course of the year and you know I think we have to get into the year see how this palace out there out there has been some discussions about moving to a unified exchange rate at call it 25 to 30 and the only thing we know for certain is that there is three official exchange rates and it\u2019s pretty complicated situation right now. Christopher Ferrara \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities : Great, that helps. And I guess what I am asking more specifically to is I am not just talking about sort of the ongoing P&L right but just because it\u2019s fairly atypical that you guys took the balance sheet charge into your number into our P&L like report normalized numbers last quarter do you have coincident balance sheet reduction charge baked into your \u201815 numbers as well not just kind of the ongoing P&L effect. Stephen Robb : The short answer is yes it is not unusual for companies when you are going through currency devaluations to have both the transaction and translation losses and to referencing but also balance sheet remeasurements so, as our fiscal outlook for both Argentina and Venezuela does anticipate some level of currency devaluation that would include transaction, translation as well as the balance sheet remeasurement component. Again the thing that I continue to emphasize it\u2019s pretty volatile situation with multiple exchange rate so, it gets complicated depending on what the government decide to do but we think we have captured the reasonable place holder for what could occur. Christopher Ferrara \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities : Got it, thanks a lot. That\u2019s helpful. Donald Knauss : Thanks Chris. Operator : The next question is from Wendy Nicholson of Citigroup. Wendy Nicholson \u2013 Citigroup: Hi, two questions if I can. First of all the international business can you give us a sense for what the margins there would be if you didn\u2019t have Venezuela? It used to be kind of low double-digit but it\u2019s not back high or is there are there other markets where you are investing at such a rate either expand Burt\u2019s or something like that that business is just structurally lower margin than it used to be. Stephen Robb : Yeah, so what I will say is that without getting into specifics because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right to do at this point. The Venezuela business is a fairly good sized drag in the total company and certainly on the International business so, if you took hypothetical that wasn\u2019t in the portfolio then you will certainly in International market that margin come up and you would also see an impact to the total company margins but I really don\u2019t want to speculate as to what the impact would be at this point. Donald Knauss : Yeah, I think Wendy you not only see I wouldn\u2019t call it significant but you\u2019d see modest increase for the total company you will also see a modest increase on the top line growth rate. Wendy Nicholson \u2013 Citigroup: Right, okay. And then that leads a little bit into my second question just embedded in your guidance right now for the full year you have talked a lot about kind of how things are going to kick in back-half FX should be less of a drag some of the effect or the boost from your demand building stuff is more back half and the gross margins are going to be down in the first half. Bust just as I am kind of playing with the model here severance on the same page do you think earnings bottom-line EPS is actually going to be up year-over-year in the first and second quarters I know you don\u2019t like to give too much quarterly guidance but maybe just roll on the same page if you\u2019re going to help us with sort of a range of possibilities? Stephen Robb : Yeah, I think as we said actually we said in last earnings call and as we record again today I think you should expect that based on the foreign currency headwinds which are significant in the first half and the incremental demand building investments that we are putting into this business to defend our market share and get the categories back on track. Sales is very likely to be down year-over-year in the first half and I think earnings could very, very well be flat to down and I think we are going to get in and see what really happens with the currencies in the categories but I think both sales and earnings will be challenged in the first half. Wendy Nicholson \u2013 Citigroup: Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Donald Knauss : Thanks Wendy. Thanks. Operator : And the next question is from Connie Maneaty of BMO Capital. Constance Marie Maneaty \u2013 BMO Capital Markets\" Hi. Donald Knauss : Connie good morning. Constance Marie Maneaty \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : I have a question on Argentina and I am wondering how you are thinking about it now that there is least in technical default and I am wondering if you think you might need to go to hyper inflationary area accounting sense you know the official rates were inflation of 12%. Donald Knauss : Correct. Constance Marie Maneaty \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : But the private forecast that are for 40. And just how does the deteriorating situation there fit in to the outlook right now? Stephen Robb : Yeah, so a couple of thoughts Wendy \u2013 Connie sorry number one, the technical default of the Argentina debt we don\u2019t think that has any near term impact on our business and we are closely monitoring obviously the economy in Argentina and that was to slowdown that could have an impact and we will also managed closing monitoring the foreign exchange environment to find out if that trigger something around devaluation more than other wise expecting. In terms of how we manage that business I would say that we continue to manage this pretty tightly because of the inflationary environment and because of the fact that it is under price controls I\u2019ll be with that to take pricing in that market. So, I think we feel good about the Argentina business today it\u2019s certainly challenging situation that we are going to need to work through but I don\u2019t think the technical default is real issue at this point for as. As far as hyper inflationary accounting that\u2019s really not a determination we would make as a company that is something that you we could be determined by the regulatory bodies and if in fact that happens obviously some of the cost instead of flowing through equity would flow through earnings that is not build into the outlook at this point and I think we just have to wait and see what happens in Argentina over the next one to two years. Constance Marie Maneaty \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Donald Knauss : Thanks Connie. Operator : The next call is from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Lauren Lieberman \u2013 Barclays Capital : Thanks. Good morning. Donald Knauss : Hey Lauren. Lauren Lieberman \u2013 Barclays Capital : Just a question about the, I know bleach shares are up but I was curious about there has been some more activity overall in bleach liquid type launching an oxy product and so on. Just if you see any traction at all from some of others kind of try to impinge on the core properties bleach? Donald Knauss : Yeah, you know it\u2019s interesting if you go back to the last three years Lauren we probably had the strongest growth on blench in the category in the last 25 years I mean FY12 was $105 and FY13 $107, FY14 $104 in the last two years the volume has been at $106 so, we are starting to see a slower bid but these other activities we are seeing you know these things are typically in the two to one share range so, they are really not having much impact and in fact a lot of times they are even shelved in the bleach category in the store. So we\u2019re not seeing a material impact yet on it. The other thing we\u2019re doing and you are going to see this with we\u2019ll be launching a thick bleach for cleaning soon. We\u2019re starting see more and more people use bleach as a cleaning agent which is good news for us I think for the category because you use more bleach when you use it as a cleaning agent. Because laundry, when you look at the laundry the trend in laundry in general the loads are going down. So I think and with the use of et cetera laundry is certainly the most relevant piece of bleach usage but we are starting to see a cleaning pick up and that\u2019s where we are going to focus. But we haven\u2019t seen lot of impact yet from these I\u2019ve called them on the tangent items. Lauren Lieberman \u2013 Barclays Capital : Yeah. And how long do you think does the retailer typically give that sort of product to get a meaningful share before it really becomes irrelevant, is it full year? Donald Knauss : I think often times you get about six months. It depends on when the modulars are reset but most of the retailers will do a half year check to see if the things has got the unit movement to stay on shelf. I think if you are on the bubble so to speak you are very hard pressed to get a year to stay on the shelf. Lauren Lieberman \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay. Great. All right. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s what I have left. Thank you so much. Donald Knauss : Thanks Lauren. Operator : The next question is from Linda Bolton Weiser from B. Riley. Linda Bolton Weiser \u2013 B. Riley: Hi. So just going back to your commentary on Venezuela. Unless I misreading your comments it sounds like you are considering as a possible option just completely exiting the market. So I guess if that\u2019s not right what would kind of make you consider that as an option, would it just be a continuation of the losses there? And also some would argue that when you exited Brazil many years ago that, that was actually not the right choice. So maybe you could just I mean Venezuela is of course a different situation entirely. But maybe you could just talk a little bit more about what\u2019s around the decision if you were to exit? Donald Knauss : Yeah. I think Linda that when we say all options I think we have to mean all options. I think this as you said Venezuela seems to be a bit of a unique case here. And I do think and I think the Venezuelan government understand that Clorox is uniquely disadvantaged given that they kept about two thirds of our portfolio under price control. So it is a non-sustainable situation. We\u2019ve had very \u2013 we believe constructive dialogue with the government over the last six months in particular. And as I said we thought we had pricing committed in early June, we are still waiting for those price increases to be published. But given the situation we\u2019re in that option has to be on the table unfortunately. And we\u2019ve been in Venezuela for decades. And as the government has said they want businesses to make a fair profit that\u2019s all we wanted to do, is make a fair profit and that hasn\u2019t been the case for the last 18 months. So it\u2019s an option that has to be on the table. Linda Bolton Weiser \u2013 B. Riley: Okay. Thank you. Donald Knauss : Thank you. Operator : This concludes the question and answer session. Mr. Knauss I would now like to turn the program back to you. Donald Knauss : Well, thanks everyone. I know it\u2019s been a busy earnings day. We certainly appreciate you hanging in there on a Friday with us and we look forward to talking to you at Halloween next time. Thanks everyone. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, you may begin. Steve Austenfeld : Great. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining Clorox's first quarter Conference call. On the call with me today are Don Knauss, Clorox's Chairman and CEO; Benno Dorer, Clorox's CEO-elect; and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for 7 days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com Let me remind you that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures, determined in accordance with GAAP, can be found in today\u2019s press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today\u2019s earnings release. Please recognize that today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Turning to our prepared remarks. I'll cover highlights of our first quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and financial outlook for fiscal year '15. And finally, Don and Benno will close with their perspectives, followed by Q&A. As we said in today's press release, results from Clorox Venezuela are now included in discontinued operations for both the current and year-ago quarters. All of our commentary today is on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise stated. For more detail on our past results from continuing operations, please see the additional schedules included in the press release we issued this morning. So turning to our top line results. In Q1, volume was up 1%, and sales grew 1%, including the impact of unfavorable foreign currencies. On a currency-neutral basis, sales grew nearly 3%. Our growth reflects the benefit of price increases taken mostly in international markets and higher volume as well as a price increase on our Glad business taken earlier in the calendar year. These results were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currencies, primarily from Argentina as well as higher trade spending. Steve will provide more details on sales drivers in a moment. In the first quarter, our U.S. 13-week market shares decreased 0.2 point versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting continued intense competitive activity in our Cat Litter and Brita businesses. The slight decline in the quarter was an improvement from the prior quarter, driven by solid market share gains in several categories, including Kingsford charcoal, Laundry and our Home Care business. This positive trend has continued as the latest data as of mid-October reflected our first total company share gain in more than a year. Looking at our categories. They were up 0.5 point in the first quarter, a nice improvement versus the decline in the prior quarter. However, this still remains below historical category growth rates, and sustained category growth has been difficult to achieve. Continuing to invest to improve our category trends and market shares remains our top priority. With that, I'll review our first quarter results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q1 volume decreased 1%, and sales were down 2% due to lower shipments of Home Care and Laundry products. In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales decreased modestly primarily due to a distribution loss of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes at a major club customer earlier this calendar year. At many other customers, wipes are performing very well. In response to the intensely competitive environment on wipes, we've increased investments in 3D demand building, including increased consumer promotions, consumer communication across TV, radio and digital highlighting the value of Clorox Wipes versus competitors' products, high levels of quality merchandising and innovation with a number of new wipes products. In the last 2 quarters alone, we've launched 4 new variants of wipes, including those for glass, bathroom and heavy-duty cleaning as well as a larger-sized wipe. Clorox remains the clear leader in the wipes category with market shares remaining near 50% in tracked channels and with share trends improving. We're optimistic this trend will continue. Looking ahead, in October, we've seen an uptick in sales of disinfecting products related to strong back-to-school execution and the start of the cold-and-flu season as well as recent concerns over enterovirus and Ebola. However, it's too soon to tell if this will have an ongoing impact on consumer use in the coming quarters. We are prepared to meet a potential increase in demand if needed. Don will talk more in a few minutes about consumer concerns regarding the spread of infection, including Ebola. In our Laundry business, Clorox Bleach lost volume as it lapped 11% volume growth in the year-ago quarter due to the earlier introduction of our concentrated formula. From a market share standpoint, our investment in this brand and our focus on value are paying off as September marked the third consecutive quarter of market share growth on Clorox Bleach. In our Household segment, we delivered 4 -- strong 4% volume growth and 5% sales growth. The segment's top line results were driven by strong performance in our Charcoal and Bags and Wraps businesses. The Charcoal business grew volume 16% due to promotions and consumption behind the Labor Day holiday and outstanding execution at retail. In Bags and Wraps, volume and sales were up behind solid category growth and incremental merchandising and distribution gains on Glad OdorShield trash bags, which delivered all-time record shipments behind great consumer acceptance of some of our new scents. These results were partially offset by lower shipments of Glad base trash bags behind a shift to premium trash bags. Turning to Cat Litter. Volume was flat, and sales and share decreased as a result of continued intense competitive pressure. In response, we're investing more aggressively in innovation and on communicating our value proposition versus the competition, particularly focusing on excellent clumping and odor control. While it's only been recently launched, we are optimistic about the recent introduction of our Fresh Step Extreme lightweight products. In our Lifestyle segment, volume was flat and sales decreased 1%. These results reflected lower shipments of Hidden Valley salad dressing and Brita products. In August, we started shipping an improved Brita filter that is faster and easier to change than competitive filters. We plan to continue introducing innovation that differentiates Brita from the competition, and we are optimistic that our Water Filtration business will return to growth in the second half of the fiscal year. Partially offsetting these decreases were double-digit volume and sales growth on Burt's Bees products, largely due to innovation in lip and face care products. In particular, our new lip crayons, new lip balm flavors, vanilla bean and wild cherry, and our face palette products were all very strong in the quarter. Turning to International. Volume was up 5% behind solid market share performance, but sales were flat, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in Argentina. On a currency-neutral basis, sales for International grew a strong 10%. While we expect modestly slower growth in some countries to continue, our market shares remain generally healthy across our international markets, and we're seeing improvement in most core countries and categories. With the exception of Argentina, we're continuing to invest in demand-building initiatives and innovation to support category growth. Looking at the balance of fiscal year 2015, we remain committed to growing our categories and market shares through strong brand investment and clearly demonstrating the value that our products provide consumers across the 3 Ds. We continue to anticipate sales to be about flat or to grow in the range of 1% to 3% on a currency-neutral basis. Now I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q1 performance and our outlook for fiscal year '15. Stephen M. Robb: Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. Before I discuss our first quarter results, let me echo Steve's comments regarding our recast financials. Unless otherwise noted, all of my commentary today is for continuing operations, with the results of Clorox Venezuela now reclassified to discontinued operations in the current and year-ago quarters. We're pleased to have started the year with a solid quarter. Sales came in a bit better than we expected due to stronger shipments of charcoal and slightly improved market share. This contributed to the company delivering diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.10 versus $1.05 in the year-ago quarter for an increase of 5%. In our first quarter, sales grew 1%, reflecting the benefit of nearly 2 points from pricing and more than 1 point of volume growth. This was offset by about 2 points of negative foreign currency impact, primarily from Argentina and nearly 1 point of higher trade promotion spending. On a currency-neutral basis, sales grew nearly 3%. Gross margin for the quarter declined 70 basis points to 42.8% compared to 43.5% in the year-ago quarter. The biggest factors contributing to the gross margin decline were about 170 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs reflecting inflationary pressures internationally, particularly from Argentina, and higher trade spending. Commodity cost increases, primarily for resin, contributed another 40 basis points to the decline. Now although oil prices have declined recently, resin, our largest commodity purchase, continues to see higher prices due to tight supply. Partially offsetting these impacts were the benefits of about 120 basis points of cost savings and about 90 basis points of pricing. Selling and administrative expense was lower in the first quarter at 13.3% of sales versus 14.4% of sales in the year-ago quarter. In the prior year quarter, the company made incremental investments to change IT service providers and to upgrade our Burt's Bees systems and processes. In the current quarter, cost savings and a onetime change in the company's long-term disability plan to make it more consistent with the marketplace also contributed to the lower selling and administrative expense. Advertising and sales promotion came in at 9% of sales, reflecting continued strong support behind our brands. In addition, our U.S. Retail advertising was nearly 10% of sales. In total, demand-building investment, including trade and advertising expense, increased $16 million versus the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to increased merchandising behind Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and other disinfecting products and the litter business. Our effective tax rate of 33.7% was lower by about 0.5 point in the quarter versus year ago. Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.10, a 5% increase versus the year-ago quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was $205 million or 15.2% of sales compared with $157 million in the year-ago quarter or about 11.7% of sales. The increase in free cash flow is primarily due to reduced employee incentive compensation payments, reflecting significantly lower year-over-year payouts and somewhat higher tax payments in the year-ago quarter. In fiscal '15, we continue to anticipate free cash flow as a percentage of sales to be about 10%. Now we'll turn to our fiscal year 2015 outlook on a continuing operations basis. First, let me clarify the impact to our fiscal '15 outlook from reclassifying Venezuela to discontinued operations. From a sales standpoint, exiting Venezuela has only a small benefit to the sales outlook since current year sales were not expected to be significantly different than prior year sales. Our initial outlook had assumed significant and ongoing price increases would partially offset the impact of currency devaluations. We are, therefore, not changing our sales growth outlook. From a profit standpoint, our previous outlook had anticipated only a modest loss in Venezuela in fiscal '15 as anticipated price increases were expected to significantly reduce the loss. Therefore, reclassifying Clorox Venezuela to discontinued operations does not have a significant impact on our EPS outlook. With that, let me provide details of our fiscal '15 continuing operations outlook. We continue to anticipate sales to be about flat as the benefits of innovation and pricing are expected to be offset by the continuing headwinds of category softness and about 2 points of negative foreign currency as the strong U.S. dollar is having a significant impact across most markets and in particular, in Argentina, where we continue to anticipate double-digit currency devaluations. On a currency-neutral basis, we continue to anticipate sales growth of 1% to 3% as previously communicated. Turning to margin. We continue to anticipate gross margin to be up slightly for the fiscal year as the benefit of cost savings and pricing will be mostly offset by higher manufacturing and logistics costs as well as higher commodity costs, especially resin. In response, we are taking a 6% price increase on our Glad business in November, which is cost justified. We continue to anticipate selling and administrative expense at about 14% of sales and advertising at about 9% of sales. We now anticipate EBIT margin will be about flat versus the prior year, a change versus the prior outlook which had assumed 25 to 50 basis points of expansion. This change in outlook is primarily due to somewhat higher resin prices and the reclassification of Venezuela to discontinued operations. For perspective, exiting Venezuela and recasting the historical results improved our fiscal '14 EBIT margin from continuing operations by 60 basis points to 17.8% versus 17.2% previously reported. Our fiscal '15 tax rate is now assumed to be slightly more favorable than before, likely closer to 34% versus the prior outlook for 34% to 35%. Net of all of these factors, we continue to anticipate diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.50, with a slightly lower EBIT margin outlook to offset by the tax rate. Looking forward, the U.S. environment remains intensely competitive, and we are committed to accelerating top line growth through product innovation and stepped-up investments in our demand-building programs. We will also continue to lean in harder on our strong cost savings programs and drive efficiencies to increase productivity. And with that, I will turn it over to Don. Donald R. Knauss: Okay. Thanks, Steve. Hello, everyone. Happy Halloween to everybody. I'm pleased to see the fiscal year is off to a really solid start in the midst of, as we all know, a tough environment out there, in part reflecting the benefits of a strong summer barbecue season, as both Steves talked about, on our Charcoal business. But I think it's also important to note that we're seeing improving market share trends in several categories, supported by increased demand-building investments and innovation. You certainly saw that in the first quarter. A question being asked a lot lately is whether concerns over enterovirus and particularly, Ebola, have had a material impact on driving growth of disinfecting products. Well, in Q1, we obviously saw no real impact from Ebola, given that the Cleaning division was down 2% in sales as we noted earlier although we did see an impact on certain disinfecting products from stepped-up execution behind our typical back-to-school season and the start of the cold-and-flu season. In fact, if you look at the wipes category in the quarter, the wipes category was up 9%, and we were up a bit above that, gaining almost a share point. Now in the most recent 4 weeks of MULO data, this is data ending October 19, we have seen a continued uptick in disinfecting product purchases related to those consumer concerns about the spread of infection. If you look at the Wipes category in that latest 4-week period, it's up in the mid-teens, and we're growing at a faster clip than that, continuing to gain share. So as -- at the same time, as Steve said, it's really much too soon to tell if those concerns are going to have an ongoing impact on consumer use and product consumption over the course of the coming quarters. We'll see how that plays out. Certainly, offering solutions such as household disinfectants, like Clorox Regular-Bleach and Disinfecting Wipes, which meet the Centers for Disease Control's current criteria for use in hospitals, that aligns with our health and wellness strategy to help stop the spread of infection in general. So as part of our Stop the Spread of Infection campaign, we're always looking for ways to help educate consumers on how to best protect themselves and their loved ones against disease. So for example, information about enterovirus and Ebola have been posted on clorox.com, including the CDC's recommendation on disease prevention. In addition, we have posted a list of our disinfecting products that meet the criteria established by the CDC. So we think the consumer is well informed. Also consistent with our values as a company and our long-standing practice of helping in times of crisis, we're working with governments and nongovernment organizations to meet critical needs in the U.S. and abroad. Just recently, we donated thousands of bottles of Clorox Bleach to West Africa, where bleach is obviously one of the most urgently needed supplies. Bleach is essential for disinfecting safety equipment and sanitizing health facilities, and we obviously believe our donations will help protect health workers, who play a pivotal role in containing that epidemic. We're also working with USAID to assess the ongoing needs in that region, and we stand ready to assist further as needed. I think it's reasons like that have made me proud to have led this company for the past 8 years. And I've certainly appreciated speaking with all of you each quarter, I think today is actually my 33rd earnings call, and at various meetings and conferences around the country and around the world. I think you've always pushed our thinking, and you've made us better for that. And for that, we're all grateful. I'm pleased to be staying on as Executive Chairman of the Board, and I couldn't be more pleased with the selection of Benno Dorer as the company's next CEO. I think many of you have met Benno over the years, so I know you're familiar with his experience and his strong strategic skills. Benno and I have worked closely together for the past 8 years that I've been here, and I can certainly testify that he's got a broad perspective and tremendous domestic and international experience here at Clorox and from his days at Procter & Gamble. He's got a strong track record of achieving results and driving change and shares with me, I think, a very similar approach to leadership. While it is certainly no-nonsense, and we focus very much on execution, it's also based on a strong set of core values. And I think those values start with a focus on integrity and putting our people first, and I have every confidence he's going to be a great leader for Clorox. And I think in addition to Benno, as you all know, we've got a terrific set of executive leaders from Steve Austenfeld, Steve Robb as CFO, Dawn Willoughby and Nick Vlahos as the new Co-Chief Operating Officers and the rest of the executive team. So I'm very pleased that all these changes have been done with internal candidates. We've got a very strong bench in this company. It's a great company, great people. It's been a privilege and an honor to have served them over the past 8 years. And so with that, I'll turn it over to Benno, and we'll wrap it up and kick off the Q&A. Benno Dorer : Hello, everyone, and thank you, Don. I very much appreciate your words, and I look forward to taking over the reins of the company next month. I'm deeply honored and excited. As everyone on the call knows, Don has just done a tremendous job leading Clorox. During his tenure, he led the company through a successful Centennial Strategy and went on to lay the groundwork for the future by establishing the company's 2020 Strategy. He does leave big shoes to fill, and I'm excited to be working with the executive team and leaders across the company to build on the strategy Don has led over 8 years. Now with Don staying on as Executive Chairman, we'll be able to make this transition seamless for the Clorox organization and the benefit of all of our stakeholders. There is no better time to be CEO at Clorox. Our people are second to none, and I believe our focus on big-share brands in midsized categories, countries and channels is the right one for us. As I've been sharing with folks in the past 6 weeks or so, this transition has a lot to do with continuity, no extreme right or left turns. I believe we're on the right path with the 2020 Strategy. At the same time, the defining issue for Clorox is accelerating profitable growth, so we're leaning into this strategy and accelerating the key elements that I believe drive the greatest value. First, we will increase our investment in demand-building programs to reinforce the value proposition of our brands, to reinvigorate our categories and to profitably grow market share. Now that means, first and foremost, creating values for consumers by delivering superior, innovative products that delight them and ensuring our communications make clear why our products are the ones to choose. Second, we will grow into profitable new categories and channels through innovation, partnerships and acquisitions. And third, we will remove waste in our work, products and supply chain to create organizational capacity and to fund growth. Underpinning all of these will be a continued focus on our people. As CEO, my job is to keep Clorox people focused on our 2020 Strategy and empower them to deliver results in a way that's consistent with our values as a company. With strong plans in place for the current fiscal year and a 2020 Strategy that sets clear objectives and focuses everyone on value creation, I am very optimistic about the future and firmly believe we have what it takes to succeed. In the interim, of course, it's about hitting our fiscal year annual goals, which is why I'm pleased we're off to a solid start this fiscal year. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from John Faucher from JPMorgan. John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I guess I want to talk a little bit about, there's a perception that the U.S., in general, is getting better. And if the consumer comes back, can you talk about where you stand from a marketing standpoint relative to peers, share of voice, et cetera, in order to be able to take advantage of that on a consistent basis? And then also want to follow up a little bit about sort of the pricing question. Don -- or you guys talked -- or Steve -- I'm not sure which one talked about sort of the pressure in the resin market. Is that something that you're going to be able to pass through to consumers? And do you need the consumer to be a little bit stronger in order to absorb some of that pricing? Donald R. Knauss: Yes. John, I think in terms of the U.S., clearly, the slight uptick we saw in the categories in the quarter with the 0.5 growth rate that Steve mentioned is certainly an improvement sequentially over where we saw the prior quarter. And looking at the University of Michigan's consumer confidence index this morning, which came out in pretty good shape, I do think the consumer in this country is becoming a little less cautious. Now having said that, we still have 1/3 of the households in this country making less than $35,000 a year. So and those wages are stagnant. So we're cautious about this. I think that's one of the reasons we're committing to spending more in marketing dollars to support the brands in the coming months. So you -- as you look at this quarter, for example, you saw about a 5% increase in our demand spending. I think that will be fairly consistent throughout the year. A lot of that spending is supporting innovation like Fresh Step lightweight litter. It's supporting increased merchandising behind disinfecting products as we go into the flu -- cold-and-flu season. So all in all, I think you'll see that increase in spending, John, continue to support the innovation we've got. We've got another wave coming out in January with brand news across most of the major brands. So I think we'll be in a good position to capitalize on that as the consumer improves. It was also interesting to note that when you think about the low-income households in this country, you're going to see more innovation from us on what we're calling LOOP products, low out of pocket. For example, we're just launching a $0.99 Clorox Bleach product that will particularly, probably most likely, show up heavily in the dollar channel. So we think the innovation, the focus on LOOP products and the increased spending behind that innovation should put us in a pretty good place. John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And if I could -- Don, I guess, if I could just follow up. More spending, do you think -- are you spending enough after you get these adjustments relative to some of the declines we've seen in brand support over the past couple years? So I appreciate that you're spending more. Is it back up to the level you need for the right level of share of voice? Donald R. Knauss: Yes. I think so, John. If you look at the spending in the U.S., for example, this quarter, we were at nearly 10% in advertising and consumer promotion. So I think that we're -- and we're going to try and continue to push the envelope on that. I think -- and when we look at the categories where we face off with private label on bleach, charcoal and trash bags, we virtually have -- we have 100% share of voice in bleach. We have 100% share voice in charcoal. And we've got near branded share of voice of 100% in trash. So I think we're in a pretty good place. Stephen M. Robb: John, this is Steve. Let me weigh in on your second question, which has to do with resin prices. It's interesting, as we've all seen, energy prices have really traded off pretty sharply over the last couple of months, but the resin market has actually been climbing steadily higher. It's pretty tight supply-demand balance right now. As a result of that, we have announced, effective in November, we are taking a 6% increase on our Glad business. What we typically see when we do this is you can see volume be somewhat depressed for a couple of quarters, sometimes 2 to 4 quarters, which is pretty normal, but then the consumer tends to come back. And again, Glad is a category that as resin prices move up, we tend to take pricing. It's cost justified. Takes time but the consumer adapts to it, and competitors have historically followed pretty quickly on that. So we think it's a right decision to protect our margins, and we think it'll be fine with the consumer over time. Donald R. Knauss: Well, I think what's interesting, John, if you look at the data in the quarter, if you look at trash, the category was up almost 4.5%, and our share traded off about 0.4 share point. If you look at the September data, the category was up 5%, and we were up in shares 0.3 share point. So it seems like, if that's that same pattern playing out, that after a few months of absorption, consumers will come back, and that's what we're seeing in the data. Operator : And next, we'll take a question from Steve Powers from UBS. Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Yes. So you've mentioned the category acceleration in the quarter, better share trends, new innovation, and all that signals a basis for optimism on the top line, I think. And then on the bottom line, the exit from Venezuela, the $0.05 disability plan benefit this quarter should help as well. So just given all that, just trying to understand the maintenance of your full year guidance. Is that just more conservatism early in the year? Or are there things on the horizon that are offsetting some of those more positive trends so far? Stephen M. Robb: Well, I think, as you say, we're certainly off to a good start on the year, and we feel very good about the plans we have in fiscal '15 and how we're executing against it. But I think it's important to note we're 90 days into this year, and we are going to have to continue to watch what happens with foreign currencies, commodity costs and how the consumer holds up as we go through the holiday season and get into the back half of this fiscal year. So I think we need more time to see how some of these things unfold as we move through the year. But at this point, we certainly feel like we're off to a good start and feel very good about the outlook that we have out there. Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. And then separate question on Venezuela, if I could. As you think about that exit, is that, at this point, a fairly cut-and-dry exercise, meaning that you have a clear blueprint to follow and that you've got line of sight to the end point? Or are there key unknowns, risks that we should be aware of that might alter the expected P&L impacts or cash cost over the course of that exercise? Stephen M. Robb: Yes. And as you saw in our press release, and I guess I would echo, we continue to believe that the after-tax cost of the exit will be about $70 million to $80 million. Now a large portion of that will fall in fiscal '15. Some of that will obviously continue onwards. But I would say we have a plan. We've executed the plan, I think, very well. But it's obviously a tough situation, and there are unknowns. So I think we're going to need to continue executing the plan that we have and moving through it. But at this point, we think the after-tax cost of $70 million to $80 million and the cash cost on an after-tax basis of $5 million to $10 million, these numbers feel right to us. Donald R. Knauss: I think that the after-tax cost is something to really focus on, in the $5 million to $10 million range. I think that as you look at FY '16 and '17, we expect very minimal impact from that. We're in the process now, we have been in an expedited sales process on the assets in Venezuela. We'll see how that plays out over the next coming weeks. Operator : And next, we'll take a question from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : You talked earlier about improving U.S. macros and how they're looking a touch better. But I'm just kind of curious, how much do you think your improved performance is a function of better macros and people's willingness to trade up perhaps versus the business-building initiatives that you guys have done? Donald R. Knauss: It's interesting, there was a survey out this morning, Olivia, from the -- that said we were the only large company not to go down in consumer satisfaction in the last year. I think our focus on 60-40 blind wins, superior products, I think, and the in-store execution that we're seeing around assortment, merchandising, pricing and shelving is really paying off. So I think the fact that we're starting to see share gains for the first time in a year as a total company, and October certainly looks to be the same trend as September in that regard, I would say that says that a lot of this is due to the team's execution in the field and the strategy and focus across the 3 Ds. So I'm pretty bullish when I look at the rest of the year, given the next wave of innovation coming in January and the superior execution I've seen in the first quarter. And again, if you look at the overlaps into the second half of the year, I mean, we were negative 2% in sales. We were positive in the first half, which is what we're lapping now. So as you look at all those factors, really good innovation, increased brand support spending levels, really good execution in store and a bit of easier overlaps as we get into the back half, I think a lot of it's due to this team's effort rather than any -- certainly, having some tailwinds helps, but we'll always prefer to swim with the current than against it. Benno Dorer : And Olivia, this is Benno. I'd also be cautious to call it a trend just yet. I think we've had quarters in the past where we've seen improvement, and then that was followed by a disappointment. So I'd love to wait another quarter or 2 until we call it a trend. I'm still cautious about this, and we're still focusing on what we can control, which is predominantly emphasizing the value of our brands, increasing our investments to drive market share and making sure that we execute our innovation with excellence. So I share the optimism, but I'd also say we want to remain cautious as far as the consumer is concerned. It remains a very challenging environment. Donald R. Knauss: Yes. I think as Steve said and Benno said, I think we've got a quarter under our belts. There are headwinds out there in terms of currency and certainly, commodities, to some extent. So we're cautiously optimistic is probably the best way to put it. Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Got it. Understood. Maybe to follow up, in Household, that was -- that certainly beat my expectations. So I'm just kind of curious what you think about the sustainability of those gains. Clearly, new distribution in Bags and Wraps probably means at least 3 more quarters of benefit, but what about Charcoal? Was that a surprise to you that -- how strong Charcoal was? Donald R. Knauss: We had very strong execution, and especially in our top 5 customers, and 2 of those top 5 are not in the syndicated data, which is Home Depot and Lowe's. So that's why the share was flattish. But when you look at the performance, as Steve said, we were up 16% in volume in the quarter. So I think that as we look forward, we're going to continue to focus on that level of execution going forward. I think we've got -- last couple years, we've got a really good game plan in place on Charcoal. And if you look at the innovation on Litter, we're cautiously optimistic, too, about Litter trends improving as we get into the next quarter and the back half of the fiscal year. And of course, Glad, we'll see how we play out in the next -- with this next price increase. But if you look at Glad in the quarter, I mean, Glad's volume was up almost 2%. And so -- and as I said, we're starting to gain a little bit of share back in September. So Charcoal was a driver, but we've got the game plan in place on how to drive that brand. Steve Austenfeld : Olivia, just as a reminder, as Don pointed out, Charcoal is performing quite well right now, but we are moving into the smallest quarter of the year just due to seasonality and even the winter season. So even if it continues to perform well, at least for the next quarter or so, it won't have the same sort of impact it had in Q2 -- or in Q1, I should say. Operator : And next, we'll take a question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Benno, congratulations on the new assignment, and Don, congrats on retirement. Donald R. Knauss: Thank you, Jason. Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I'm sure you'll stay busy. So I wanted to drill down a little bit more on the cost outlook. You're talking about elevated resin prices now. I guess the trade's talking about some of these poly reactors coming back online soon and the potential for some loosening. As you mentioned, some of the feedstock is quite down. It appears that resin markets are poised to roll over. So I guess, first, would love to get your thoughts on that. And then secondly, what does it mean for your pricing? I know, looking back in time, October '08, you took prices on Glad trash bags up 10%. 2 months later, in December, you had to roll them back, and then there were a number of rollbacks that followed that. Why would this time be different if we get the relief? Stephen M. Robb: Well, let me start off talking a little bit about the resin market. In the -- it's a tough situation because, to your point, feedstock prices are down pretty significantly. But at the same time, we've really got a situation where supply remains fairly tight, demand remains fairly solid, and when you bring it together, it translates into rising prices. And it's certainly what we anticipated coming into the year, but we recently saw another several penny move upward in resin prices that certainly looks like it's sticking in the marketplace. So our expectation is that prices are moving up, that they're likely to stay elevated. You could see some up and down over time, but these markets have tended to float up, level off for a period of time and then go to new highs. So that's really what we're planning for. As it relates to the pricing that we've taken on Glad, again, this is a category that tends to follow what happens with resin prices. So as prices go up, we try to price to the long-term average cost in resin. If, by some chance, resin prices go back down, you might have to step up the merchandising spend at that point. But at this point, we think prices are up. They're likely to stay elevated, and we're taking pricing accordingly. Operator : Our next question will come from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Don, we are going to miss you. You've done a great job here, and Benno we look to, certainly, hearing more from you. Donald R. Knauss: Thanks, Ali. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : I had a couple questions about Venezuela first. So if I look at the kind of supplement table where you break out and restate the adjusted with the kind of $17 million shift to the losses from discontinued section, does -- so just from a clarification perspective, does that include the devaluation or not? Because I thought the devaluation was about $0.13, that ends up being $0.13. And if it does, I guess I want to ask -- or even if it does or doesn't, I want to ask your thought process in getting out of Venezuela. You clearly are the first ones to do it. You have been ahead of your peers on Venezuela. So I want to get a better sense of how you think about it, what you thought tomorrow was going to look like in Venezuela, in terms of the $70 million hit today and the $70 million charge to get out of it. And then if you can parlay that also to what your vision is for Argentina, given you guys, again, have been ahead on the Venezuela story here. Donald R. Knauss: Yes. Let me start, Ali, with the thought process on Venezuela, and I'll let Steve jump in on the question you had on the chart. The thought process was, we have been under price controls for 3 years in Venezuela. And as you know, we believe that we may have been uniquely disadvantaged in the fact that about 70% of our portfolio was under price control. And of course, over that 3-year period, absorbing over 100%, in some cases, 200%, inflation cumulatively over that period of time took our gross margins from about -- in the high 30s to 40%, which was fairly consistent with U.S. gross margins. It was not materially different, and it was one of -- it was certainly a competitive gross margin for us, down into negative gross margin territory most recently. We had 29 meetings with the government between July of 2012 and July of 2014 explaining the predicament we were in and the real need for pricing in that market to be able to create a sustainable business. And of course, last year ended with $77 million of revenue and a $23 million operating loss. Although we had a more modest loss built into the margin -- or into the budget for this year, the pricing that we had been promised in June was delayed by 3 months. Each month was really another hit to the P&L, and of course, the pricing that was actually delivered in September was significantly below what we were promised. We saw no hope that we could create a sustaining business in that country. And given the issues -- the other macro issues they were dealing with, including the price of oil dropping, we didn't see any sustainable model for continuing to operate in that market, and that's what drove the decision. So over a 2-year period, after 29 meetings, it was time to make a call, and it was clearly in our shareholders' best interest to exit. And that was the thought process. Stephen M. Robb: And Ali, this is Steve. Let me address at least a portion of your question regarding Venezuela financials. All of the activity of Venezuela in the quarter has been reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations. So that would include things like the operating losses in Venezuela for the quarter, which were about $6 million; asset charges associated with inventory, property, plant and equipment; as well as certain exit costs, including severance and recognition of foreign currency translation losses. This is one where it's pretty technical and detailed. I think we've got some good schedules in the web attachments to help you with this, and we also have a 10-Q coming out early next week that really details this. But happy to take your call offline if you'd like us to step you through more of the details on this. Benno Dorer : And then you asked about Argentina. First of all, I'd say Argentina is not Venezuela. First of all, we actually made a profit in fiscal year '14. And the country -- our performance in the country was actually better than we expected, in part because we are getting pricing from the government and also the fundamentals in the country are better, which includes the fact that the middle class consist of about 40% of the population versus only about 10% in Venezuela. And keep in mind that Argentina, historically, if you look at the last 40 to 50 years, is moving at about 10-year cycles economically, and right now, we're near, even though -- probably not at the bottom but near the bottom of that cycle. So what we're focused on in Argentina is executing what we can control with excellence. That includes a strong focus on cost savings. That includes offsetting, as best as we can, inflation through pricing, and that includes margin-accretive innovation. Said that all, I will say that we're closely monitoring the situation in Argentina, and we fully expect the situation to remain challenging for a while. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Okay. Can I ask 1 question which has 3 kind of quick hits on different categories? One is on Glad trash shifting to more premium. I guess I would have expected more of a pricing increase. You mentioned price, but I don't know if that includes price mix. I would have expected more of price mix kind of increase as you go into ForceFlex or what have you versus the traditional Glad trash there. More details, if you can, on Hidden Valley. It seems that some shelf space has been lost, I guess, when we do our in-store checks. Want to get your perspective on that, whether that's just a short-term thing or just misread. And then third is if you play forward on Glad on the price increases based on the oil price -- based on the commodity price from the resins perspective, historically, that has come from oil prices, over time, and certainly, you start seeing an impact maybe 4 or 5 months later from oil into the supply chain for resins. Is that contemplated? Or is it a different situation this time? Stephen M. Robb: Ali, let me start with your last question first. As it relates to resin prices, here in North America, those resin prices are actually more closely aligned with natural gas ethylene, ethane. They're not directly tied to oil prices. Now oil prices can obviously influence the global market for resin pricing, and we're obviously working in global markets. But from a feedstock standpoint, oil can go down, and it's quite possible that resin prices can go up. The biggest factor driving resin prices up right now is something we've been talking about for quite some time, which is supply and demand. And I think the good news is, as you look out over the long term, several years from now, there is new capacity being built here in the U.S. that'll bring new supply to the market. But that's several years out, and therefore, as we look forward into the market, we think the supply-demand situation is going to remain fairly tight. That's likely to put some upward pressure on the floor underneath resin pricing. Donald R. Knauss: Yes. Ali, as far as your question on Hidden Valley and the other brands, on Hidden Valley, we've seen no distribution losses in terms of shelving. We have seen some of the larger customers cut back on inventories, which is a short-term blip before merchandising -- as merchandising comes out of the summer. So there's nothing structural there at all. In fact, if you look at shares of Hidden Valley salad dressing in September, for example, it was basically flat. The category is down about 0.5 point. I think we were down 0.1 point, so basically flat. We've got some innovation on Hidden Valley, like premium dry dips, so the brand's as healthy as ever. So we've seen nothing in terms of any structural change to shelf spacing -- to shelf space. As far as Glad goes, we've got about 70% of that brand now is in premium trash. I think the falloff in the base trash has dragged down a little bit on the pricing. But that mix, as we go through the balance of the year, should continue to improve, and we'll see with this latest price increase, what that does to pricing on the brand in general. Operator : Our next question will come from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : First of all, congratulations to both of you. So on the promo spend line, I think you said you had $16 million of incremental strategic spending in the quarter. Is the right way to read that is advertising was up, like, $1 million and the other $15 million was higher contra-sales promotions? Stephen M. Robb: Yes, that's the way to look at it, Bill. And when you look at that $15 million, it was basically in merchandising support behind innovation and cold and flu. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay, got you. All right. Because the pricing was still pretty healthy, and I would have thought that, that spend would come out against... Stephen M. Robb: Yes. It was more couponing, merchandising display support, those kinds of things. So it wasn't TFIs, if you will, so much in terms of temporary price -- temporary fund increases for price reductions on shelf. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay, got you. And then on the Charcoal side, like, the growth was obviously pretty extraordinary. Is there anything one-off that we should be mindful as we model the first quarter of next year? Is there like a big promotion, like a fence thing at Costco or whatever that might not get repeated? Donald R. Knauss: It's hard to know. I think, again, at the end of the day, we had really good plans that we put in place. We executed them extremely well, and the weather was good. And when you bring it all together, it turned out to be a very nice quarter for the Charcoal business. I think, again, over the long term, we feel good about the plans to grow that business. But obviously, lapping double-digit growth is going to be challenging as we get into the first quarter of next year. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay, great. And then just lastly, on the professional business, we didn't talk much about it on the call. There hasn't been deal activity there in a while. Is it just because it's taken a while to find the right assets? Are you guys kind of putting that on hold? Or kind of what's driving that? Donald R. Knauss: I'm sorry, Bill, I didn't hear the first part of your question. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : I'm just talking about professional. We didn't really hear a lot about it on the call, and there hasn't been a lot of deal activity there from you guys. And I know it's a pretty clear strategic priority, so I was just wondering why we haven't seen more on that front. Donald R. Knauss: Yes. I think we're still -- recall that when we had the analyst meeting a couple of years ago, we've talked about the 3 legs of our stool : U.S. Retail, PPD and International. PPD we said would grow in the 10% to 15% range. We don't see that changing, Bill. It grew at a -- in a single-digit rate this quarter, but we had some challenges with a claim on one of our products that we've reinstated. And so we see that business continuing to grow at the double-digit rate going forward, so I don't think there's any issue there. As far as M&A goes, that's one of our primary focus areas, obviously, is M&A in that space, bolt-on M&A, that is. So we'll see what happens there. But nothing really changing in terms of what our expectations are for that business. And clearly, as you look at the retail trends in October around stopping the spread of infection, we're seeing that same thing translate into health care facilities as well. Benno Dorer : And then Bill, if you -- again, our ambition for the professional business going forward is to grow it in the 10% to 15% range, and that continues to be a mix of organic and M&A. So while it's always tougher to plan for obvious reasons, as Don said, we continue to be focused on finding the right M&A partners for that business. But we'll also stay disciplined, and we'll want to be focused on finding the right opportunities at the right time. Operator : And next, we'll take a question from Wells Fargo, Chris Ferrara. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Guys, can you talk a little bit about, I guess, your thoughts early on in the process of the disinfecting products picking up? Like, wipes were good, you cited that, into October. They were decent in September, right? So how do you think about how much of that is consumer pantry loading versus what's actually coming through? And again, I know it's early on, right, but you've seen this sort of stuff before, right? We've had other instances of this, right? So is it your sense that pantries are being loaded? Or do you think this stuff is actually being used? And then also, are retailers now -- are you thinking you're going to see more sell-in in anticipation of consumers picking up? Benno Dorer : Well, like you said, it's really too early to say. So we're pleased with the incremental activities we've got in merchandising as a result of our planning, which was mostly around back-to-school and mostly around the flu season, and we've certainly seen an uptick. But historically, we have seen seasons where that has led to incremental consumption and also incremental household penetration. Keeping in mind that household penetration in this category is still only at about 50%, and there's ways to go. But we've also seen other seasons where it's led to a trough in the periods post the flu season. So I would say it's really, really too early to say. We are seeing an uptick in merchandising and an uptick in initial sales, but I would say it's too early to say. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Got it. That helps. And I guess, on the guidance, the EBIT margin number obviously is coming down. I think I understood you guys right, but are you basically saying that because Venezuela -- the reclass of Venezuela is what's driving that margin target down, in other words, the pricing you're expecting in Venezuela is why you had thought EBIT margin would have been up 25 to 50? Is that -- am I getting that right? Stephen M. Robb: Yes. It's -- so first of all, and this is important, the absolute EBIT margin in fiscal '14, as a starting point, is 60 basis points higher. So we're starting from a higher place. All we're saying is that for fiscal '15, we think EBIT margin will be about flat, could be a little above or a little below that, but we think it's about flat. And the reason for that is because some of the expected EBIT margin improvement that we were counting on was coming from improving Venezuela, and we're actually going to get that. We're just getting it a different way. We're getting it because we've decided to exit the business. We've also had a bit more pressure in resin than we had anticipated. All of that said, as we look to the longer term, I think we continue to feel very good about the cost savings program, the pricing actions we're taking, the tight controls we have in place on SG&A. All of that gives us pretty good confidence that we'll continue to see good, solid EBIT margin expansion of 25 to 50 bps over the long term. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Yes, that's great. And then just real quick. I don't know if you said it, but the disability help or the $0.05 in benefit, where did that -- did that flow through COGS and SG&A? Or was that in other? Stephen M. Robb: Yes, your accounting is really good. It flows through both, as a matter of fact. Some of that floated to SG&A, some of it floated to COGS. You did notice that our SG&A cost as a percentage of sales came in lower than the year ago. Part of that was because of the cost savings programs that we were driving in the company, and then a portion of that's just this onetime accrual adjustment that we needed to make in the quarter. Operator : And next, we'll go to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about International volume trends. It's just been so long, given the pressure from Venezuela, that we've seen kind of a \"clean number.\" So would you say that this kind of mid-single-digit pace is something you see as sustainable and really what's been underlying the reported trends for a while now or not really? Benno Dorer : Yes. So Lauren, our stated goal as far as sales is concerned for International is 5% to 7% in year-on-year sales growth, and that remains our goal. And I'm -- we're seeing some slowdown, particularly in the faster-growing LatAm markets. Said that, it's important to remember that the absolute growth in those markets is still faster than in North America, and these are still attractive and profitable areas to invest. So I would say no change to our ambitions. What we are focused on is shifting the investment within International from less profitable and more stable markets into those faster-growing markets, like Chile, Peru and Colombia, and we're focused on improving our 3D plan execution to drive market share. And I'm pretty pleased with the progress, but we can do more. I also think that this is a good time to remind ourselves that, really, what we want to do in International is to improve the profitability of the growth in those markets as a primary objective, and we're doing that through cost savings. We're doing that by reaping the benefits of the SAP implementation in Latin America, through pricing and through margin-accretive innovation. So really no change to innovation, 5% to 7% sales growth, but more profitably to reverse the margin decline that we've seen as a result of onetimers as well as inflationary trends in International. Donald R. Knauss: I think, Lauren, just to build on Benno's comments, I think where we have really focused our investment, and you look at the countries we've talked about in the past, Peru, Colombia, Mexico, to some extent, all those countries in the quarter had high single-digit volume growth, which is pretty encouraging from our standpoint. Even Argentina had low single-digit volume growth, there was still volume growth, which we felt very good about. So where -- those countries where we have invested resources, we're seeing those pretty good trends continue. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Great. And then just another follow-up on the -- both professional products and Ebola concerns. Nothing to sneeze at in terms of your aspirations and growth rates you've been getting in professional. But I would think that with bleach being, and many of your products, CDC approved for fighting Ebola, there would be an enormous sales opportunity around this concern to get doors to open you've had trouble getting into before for whatever reason. Is that something you're trying to push harder with your sales force on right now? Donald R. Knauss: Well, I think we're always very careful, Lauren, about trying to take advantage of some public health scare for people. So we're trying to be very mindful of that. I would say this, that bleach, which is the most effective and cheapest disinfectant in general has had -- there are some barriers with hospital usage and acute care facility usage, given the odor, if you work around it all day. There's residue. I mean, bleach is basically saltwater, right, with an electric charge to it. So if you wiped out a black toilet in a hospital, there's a little salt residue that you have to go back and clean up. What we're seeing from hospitals now is some of those concerns around odor and some -- a little bit of residue, those pale in comparison to the concerns about stopping the spread of infection. So I think to your point, bleach has always been acceptable, but it's probably becoming more acceptable in this environment that this is the thing that is the most effective against most bacteria and viruses out there. So clearly, as I said, the step-up we're seeing in the wipes category in October is not unlike the step-up we're seeing in professional and acute care facilities either. Operator : Our next question will come from Erin Lash with Morningstar Investing Company. Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Most of my questions have been answered, but I wanted to follow up on the uptick or the pressure from manufacturing and logistics costs in the quarter. We've heard from a few other consumer product companies that the driver shortage is weighing on their cost of delivery, and I was wondering if that's what your increase in costs was related to and if it wasn't, what that kind of reflects. Stephen M. Robb: I think that's right. I think it's several things. It's driver shortage, and just the shortage of trucks, in general, I think, is putting a bit of upward pressure. Wage inflation, obviously, is contributing somewhat. And then even on rail, I think rail costs are starting to go up. You've got more oil moving on rail as opposed to other forms of transportation, and that's kind of crowding things out. So I don't think it's any 1 thing. I think it's a collection of things. We've certainly seen the pressure, and we would anticipate that, that pressure's going to continue for some time. Donald R. Knauss: I wouldn't -- Erin, it's interesting, I wouldn't say there's necessarily a numerical shortage of drivers as much as the new federal regulations around limiting drivers to 8 hours versus 12 hours, obviously, cuts down the capacity that an individual driver can have. And that's what's really fueling part of this, no pun intended. Operator : And next, we'll take a next question from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: A couple of questions on -- very category specific, on wipes. I understand that the category overall has picked up. When you see the data though, and we haven't seen that October data that you are referring to, we still see very strong growth of private label and growing double digits, lapping huge growth from last year. And now private label and Reckitt have essentially 50% share. So to what extent do you feel that the category -- the pricing architecture of the category is safe given the growth of private label? And secondly, on Cat Litter, if you can explain us in terms of what is lacking on the innovation or marketing side or pricing side on your end that Nestl\u00e9 and Church are doing so much better on the pet litter category. Donald R. Knauss: Yes. Javier, let me take wipes, and I'll turn it over to the Benno on litter. On wipes, we feel very good about the pricing we're getting in the market. Of course, wipes is one of those products where we didn't really take pricing for 14 years, so the architecture in that category has been fairly -- very -- in fact, very stable and consistent. If you look at the share data, over the last 4 months, we've seen very positive share gains for us. If you take our share, which is almost back to a 50%, we're equal to the private label and our branded competitor combined. So we feel very good with our trends in that category and our pricing and our margin structure in that category. So with the innovation we've got rolling out, as Steve noted, we've got 4 different new wipe formats out there, we feel very good about how that category is performing. It's kind of promises made, promises kept. We told all of you we thought we'd see those share gains coming back, and that's what's happening. Benno Dorer : And then, Javier, on litter, first of all, Litter is a business we believe we have the right to win and certainly also has attractive tailwinds from a consumer standpoint. And I believe and the right to win is certainly grounded in the fact that we think we have a superior product that controls odor better than the competition. I think it's fair to say that over the last few months, we've been somewhat under pressure because the execution in that category on our side wasn't where we wanted to be, but we're moving fast to correct that and putting plans in place to reverse the share trends. And while we don't expect that to happen overnight, it'll take a few quarters, we're optimistic that we will be able to grow share in that business within a few quarters. And the plans that we're putting in place starts with new advertising that's squarely focused on demonstrating why our product delivers superior value to consumers. It includes an investment, and Don spoke to this earlier, in the right merchandising frequency, and we're starting to see some of that. And then finally, a real step up in innovation programs, which includes, of course, the lightweight litter, which is out there right now and really off to a nice start. And in some ways, this program follows the program and the model that we started to implement on bleach and on Disinfecting Wipes a few quarters ago, where we're now seeing a return to share growth. Our ambition certainly is, on litter, to drive the same results. So a business where we think we have the right to win, where we're putting improved plans in place and where we are cautiously optimistic that we will see a reversal of the share trends in the near future. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: And a follow-up on laundry additives like bleach and that kind of product. During the price war or at least the price promotions that Procter ran in July and August, we saw a lot of, I don't know whether it's retailer sponsor or if there was communication between you and Sun Products, but there was a lot of co-merchandising of Clorox products and Sun detergents. Is this something that you guys conducted? Is it something that is going to continue? What shall we read in terms of if this is some sort of strategic alliance that you are getting? If you can comment on that, it will be helpful. Benno Dorer : Yes. So on bleach, this is something that we've been focused on. If you think about the category, anytime a retailer is able to sell more than 1 product in the category, meaning a bleach or a laundry additive along with a detergent, that leads to an increased dollar ring for the retailer and is, of course, valuable. And we've been driving that strategy with our retailers, including partners like Sun for a while now, and we're seeing good success behind that. So to answer your question, that is strategic, and it's intentional. And it's something that you should expect to continue to show up in the marketplace. Operator : And that question will come from Connie Maneaty from BMO Capital Markets. Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Canada : I was interested in the comment that you made about 1/3 of households making less than $35,000 a year. I'm wondering if you know what percentage of that big population is a core Clorox consumer and if you are adequately reaching them or if -- and if not, how big do you think this LOOP program can become? How many categories can it spread to? Donald R. Knauss: Yes. Connie, it's interesting, our market share of cleaning products with that low-income consumer is almost identical to our market share in the general population. Now the risk is that, that share erodes and is more fragile than our share with the general population. And that's one of the reasons why we're so focused on these LOOP products, which I think can cover a number of different categories that we compete in. We're focused, first, on cleaning. But clearly, when you think about trash bags or you think about Hidden Valley or you think about any of our brands, there's a way to get a lower out-of-pocket price point on the shelf by adjusting package size. So that -- the good news is that people in that low-income group want brands. They want premium brands, and they also tend to buy premium brands around the first of the month when the pay period hits. So we're also trying not only to influence our packages and our -- the size of -- or to get to the right price point, but also tie our merchandising support in those channels to the first part of the month so we can capitalize and help them get access to our products when they have the money to afford them. Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Did the LOOP -- is it just a change of packaging? Or is it also a change of formulation? Because it would seem to me that you'd already been serving the dollar stores pretty well. So what's the difference between... Donald R. Knauss: Yes. It's more of a change in packaging size. So for example, on Clorox Bleach, it's identical to the product we put in the 64, the king size, it's just in a smaller package, whether it's 16-ounce or a quart-sized type package. So we don't want to do anything that would jeopardize -- or put a cheaper product in. Now there are other brands that we've launched, like Fraganzia, that have a different formulation that are targeted, for example, to a lower-income consumer that would be the same product. So regardless of what package size we'd be in, we would not do anything to cheapen the product from the core sizes. Benno Dorer : So thanks, everyone, for joining us on today's call, and we look forward to speaking with you again when we share our second quarter results. Operator : This concludes our conference for today. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, you may begin your conference. Steve Austenfeld : Great, thank you. Welcome, everyone and thank you for joining Clorox's second quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, Clorox's Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our Web site, thecloroxcompany.com. Let me remind you that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt-to-EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures, determined in accordance with GAAP, can be found in today\u2019s press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our Web site as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today\u2019s earnings release. Please recognize that today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Now turning to our prepared remarks. I'll cover highlights of our second quarter business performance by-segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and financial outlook for fiscal year '15. And finally, Benno will wrap-up our prepared remarks as well as open it up for Q&A. Consistent with today\u2019s press release all of our commentary today is on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise stated. Turning to our top-line results. In second quarter, volume was up 4%, and sales grew 3%, including the impact of three points of unfavorable foreign currencies with the largest impact coming from Argentina. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies sales grew 6%. Our growth reflects higher volume as well as a nearly two point benefit from price increases. Importantly, our sales results reflect strong performance across all U.S. segments and international on a currency neutral basis. In Q2, our U.S. 13-week market shares decreased one-tenth of a point versus the year-ago quarter. The slight decline in the quarter reflected continued intense competitive activity in our Cat Litter and Brita businesses. Inversely, we saw market share improvements in our Laundry business with Clorox Liquid Bleach and Clorox 2 Stain Fighter & Color Booster at two year highs. The Homecare category also continues to strengthen. For eight consecutive months we've grown market share on this business with strong second quarter gains in Clorox Disinfecting Wipes leading the way. Burt's Bees also grew market share in the quarter with very strong gains in face and lip care. Looking at our U.S. categories, they were up just over a point in the second quarter. A nice improvement following the half point gain we saw in Q1. We're continuing to invest to improve our category trends and strengthening our market shares remains a top priority. With that, I will review our second quarter results by-segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q2 volume and sales each increased 3% behind strong results in our Professional Products and Homecare businesses. Our Professional Products business delivered 21% volume growth and 19% sales growth behind double-digit shipment gains in Professional Cleaning and Healthcare along with a solid gain in Food volume. While concerns about Ebola and Enterovirus had limited impact on our Retail business which I will discuss in a moment healthcare institutions did respond with significant purchases of cleaning and disinfecting products contributing to top-line growth for the quarter. Volumes of strong sales in Q2 we anticipate some slowdown in Professional Products in Q3 as these concerns have now abated. In Homecare which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased behind strong execution on several merchandizing events, along with distribution gains for our Toilet Cleaners. The solid volume in sales growth more than offset a distribution loss on Clorox Disinfecting Wipes at a major club customer last calendar year, a loss that we've now anniversaried beginning this month. In the near-term, we don't anticipate getting distribution back at this customer. For prospective, our focus is on profitable growth for Clorox and Category Health, not growth at any cost. We believe we have the right strategy in place to drive our business and category growth in a profitable manner. In particular, we continue to believe there is opportunity for increased household penetration in the wipes category, particularly as we launch meaningful innovation. For example, we recently launched several new products including our wipe with Micro-Scrubbers it is consumer preferred versus those currently in market. As well as new Clorox Triple Action Dust Wipes that allow consumers to dust an entire room with one extra large wipe that picks up dust, hair and allergens such as pet dandruff. Importantly, as part of our strategy to expand wipes usage around the home, we also introduced Clorox ScrubSingles kitchen pads which come preloaded with Clorox cleaner and are meant to be tossed after use, thereby eliminating one of the most germ laden items in households, the reusable sponge. There is a version of ScrubSingles for use in bathrooms as well. As we shared with you before Clorox remains the clear leader in the wipes category, with market shares near 50% in tracked channels, more than twice that of the nearest branded player and sheer trends have continued to improve. Early in the quarter we did see an uptick in wipe shipments heading into the cold and flu season behind consumer concerns regarding Ebola. But heightened consumer demand moderated quickly as reported cases dwindled. With the flu season just now getting into full swing, we will be monitoring consumption and using regional flu data to work with retailers to help target disinfecting wipe shipments where they are needed most. In our laundry business, sales declined due to decreased Clorox Bleach volume as a result of category softness compared to strong category growth in the prior year. From a market share standpoint our investment in this brands and focus on value are paying off as December marked the fourth quarter consecutive quarter of market share growth on Clorox Bleach. Looking ahead, due to increases for input costs to our Bleach business we're in the process of implementing a 7% average price increase effective February 1st. In our Household segment, we delivered 3% volume growth and 5% sales growth. The segment\u2019s top-line results were driven by strong performance in our Glad and Cat Litter businesses. Our Bags and Wraps business grew volume 3% driven by innovation behind our Hawaiian Aloha Scent as well as new Gain Scented Trash Bags through our partnership with Procter & Gamble. Sales on Glad were up double-digits behind price increases taken in 2014. Even in the face of intense competition Cat Litter volume and sales increased behind distribution growth of our new Fresh Step Extreme Lightweight product. We continue to invest aggressively in innovation and communicating our value proposition versus the competition, particularly focusing on excellent clumping and odor control, such as with our new Eliminate Odor for 10 Days campaign that was launched in the second quarter. Keeping in mind that Q2 is a relatively small quarter for our Charcoal business sales and volume declined following double-digit growth in the first quarter as retailers transitioned to our new and improved Kingsford Charcoal product that launched in January in advance of the 2015 growing season. In our lifestyle segment volume grew strong 5% and sales increased 4%. These results were driven by very strong double-digit volume and sales growth on Burt's Bees largely due to innovation in lip and face care products. In particular, our new lip crayons and new Vanilla Bean and Wild Cherry lip balm flavors grew strongly in the quarter supported by our first ever Burt's Bees television advertising. Our Facial Towelette business and skin brightening products were also very strong in the quarter. Turning to our Food business, sales grew versus the year ago quarter behind higher volume for bottled and dry Hidden Valley products. Finally the segment\u2019s positive results in Burt's Bees and Food were partially offset by lower sales and shipments of our water filtration products primarily due to consumption declines on pour-through filters. As previously communicated, we started shipping an improved Brita filter in August that is faster and easier to change than competitive filters. In November, we began we shipping improved pitchers, with our focus on innovation we\u2019re optimistic that our Water Filtration business will have a stronger second half of the fiscal year. Turning to International, volume was up 5% behind strong operating performance and volume growth in nearly all regions. However sales declined 2% due to the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates. If you exclude the impact of foreign currencies, sales for International grew 11%. With oil and other commodity prices having fallen capital investment in some countries has moderated resulting in slowing economic growth in some of our key markets such as Chile and Peru. Strategically, we remain committed to growing profitably in our international markets and continue to take steps to overcome macroeconomic trends such as negative foreign currencies, high inflation and slowing GDP growth. In particular, we continue to carefully assess spending across our International division and implement price increases to mitigate the macro headwinds. Looking at the balance of fiscal year 2015, as noted in this morning\u2019s earnings release, we\u2019ve increased our sales growth outlook for the full year to be about 1%. The revised sales outlook takes into account the strength in the first half along with an updated outlook for the second half of the year. As I discussed, we anticipate some slowdown in Q3 in Professional Products following very strong Q2 shipments impart related to Ebola and Enterovirus concerns that have now greatly abated. In addition, we now anticipate stronger foreign exchange headwinds along with higher trade spending to support our categories and grow market shares, as well as defend against reduced prices by competitors following the decline in import cost. Now I\u2019ll turn over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q2 performance and our outlook for fiscal year 2015. Steve Robb : Thanks, Steve and welcome everyone. Well we\u2019re pleased to have delivered a second quarter and a solid first half for fiscal \u201915. In addition to strong sales growth in the quarter, we delivered another quarter of very good earnings growth. As you saw in our press release, we\u2019ve raised our fiscal year outlook for sales and earnings per share to reflect our solid first half results. In our second quarter, sales grew 3% reflecting four points of volume growth and two points from pricing, partially offset by three points of unfavorable foreign currencies. On a currency neutral basis, sales grew nearly 6%. Our top-line results came in better than expected driven by strength in our Glad, Professional Products and Burt\u2019s Bees businesses. Gross margin for the quarter increased 10 basis points to 42.5% reflecting 130 basis points of cost savings and 100 basis points of pricing largely offset by 90 basis points of higher commodity costs as well as 90 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics cost reflecting continued inflationary pressures in International. And as we previously communicated we continue to see significant cost pressures in the logistics and transportation market due to the tight supply of trucks and railcars. Selling and administrative expense was lower in the second quarter at 14.2% of sales compared to 15% of sales in the year ago quarter when the Company made incremental investments to change IT service providers. Cost savings also contributed to lower selling and administrative expenses. Advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was more than 9% of sales reflecting continued strong support behind our brands particularly to drive trial of new products. Notably, our U.S. retail advertising spend was about 11% of sales. Our effective tax rate of 34.9% was almost a point lower versus year ago, but in line with our full year projections. Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.97, an 8% increase versus the year ago quarter. Fiscal year-to-date free cash flow was 207 million compared with 159 million in the year ago period. The increase was driven by lower employee incentive compensation payments, lower tax payments and the initial funding of the Company\u2019s non-qualified deferred compensation plan last year. These factors were partially offset by 25 million in payments to settle interest rate hedges related to the Company\u2019s issuance of long-term debt the expense of which will be amortized over the 10 year life of the debt. In December of 2014 we issued 500 million in senior notes increasing the Company\u2019s quarter-end cash balance with proceeds subsequently used to pay down a portion of the notes that matured on January 15th of this year. For fiscal \u201915 we continue to anticipate free cash flow as a percentage of net sales to be about 10% of sales. Now I\u2019ll turn to our fiscal year 2015 outlook, as Steve mentioned our fiscal year sales outlook now anticipate sales growth of about 1% reflecting solid first half sales results, product innovation and the benefit of pricing. Our sales outlook also now anticipates an even greater impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in the range of 2% to 3%. In addition, fiscal year sales are anticipated to be impacted by slowing international economies as well as higher full year trade promotion spending as we continue to invest in our business and drive trial of new products. [Audio Gap] are expected to more than offset higher manufacturing and logistics cost. Given the significant decline in oil prices we now anticipate lower resin prices in the second half and commodity costs are expected to be about flat for the full year. For fiscal year of 2015 we continue to anticipate selling and administrative expenses at about 14% of sales. EBIT margin is expected to be about flat, as incremental demand [Audio Gap] expansion. We continue to anticipate our fiscal \u201915 tax rate to be about 34%. And net of all of these factors we have raised our fiscal year outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to $4.40 to $4.55. As we look ahead to fiscal year 2016, we anticipate the benefits from continuing commodity softness to be partially offset by continued increases in logistics costs. Also, as we have done historically we may use a portion of the resin-related savings to address potential competitive price cuts. We will also closely track headwinds in international markets, including foreign currency declines and slowing economies. Now before I turn it over to Benno, I did want to let you know that moving forward we will provide next year\u2019s fiscal year outlook starting with fiscal 2016 during our Q4 earnings call, which takes place in August. This change allows us to provide you with an outlook based on a full year of actuals and puts us more in line with the timing of our peer group\u2019s outlook announcements. I am happy to address any questions you might have on this process change, but I want to make you aware of this prior to the Q3 earnings release in May. And with that I will turn it over to Benno. Benno Dorer : Thank you, Steve and hello everyone. It\u2019s great to be joining you on my first call as Clorox\u2019s CEO given the strong second quarter we just completed. This quarter\u2019s performance follows a very solid Q1 and it also speaks to the commitment to the 2020 strategy and our focus on continuity with the leadership transition. That continuity of purpose is evidenced in our continued emphasis on category and overall market share improvement, profitably driving growth and stronger top-line performance and creating shareholder value. Now clearly as we head into the second half, we are facing a number of challenges, including continuous softness in several categories, worsening foreign exchange headwinds, and slowing economies in many international markets. I believe we are taking the right steps to support our brands with increased investments, while driving margin improvement to grow profitably in this difficult environment. And as I discussed with you on last quarter\u2019s call, the refining opportunity for Clorox is accelerating profitable growth. And looking ahead we are leaning into four key elements of our 2020 strategy that I believe drive the greatest value. These areas of emphasis which we are calling strategy accelerators will drive decisions around where we will invest more heavily. Again with intend to drive profitable growth. And I would like to take a few minutes to introduce these to you today. And at an Analyst Meeting we plan on hosting later this year, we will delve more deeply into how we are activating them. The first area of emphasis is accelerating portfolio momentum. In other words, leveraging tailwinds to generate more growth from our portfolio and investing more heavily against those brands and categories that have a stronger right to grow. The second is accelerating 3D technology transformation, which aims to address increasing consumer fragmentation, the shift in how today\u2019s consumers shop and buy their products, and how we must engage with them to win the battle for the physical and virtual shopping carts. The third area of emphasis is accelerating innovation. Now this isn\u2019t just about product innovation, it\u2019s about innovation in sales and marketing as well as product supply. Really anything that has to do with our demand creation model built around the three Ds of desire, decide and delight. Innovation in all these areas drives category growth, and we are committed to driving more of that. Finally we want to accelerate our growth culture while at the same time maintaining our tradition of operational excellence. We want to dial-up our strong Clorox culture to have an even more deeply ingrained growth mindset. I strongly believe these four areas of emphasis are what we need to drive growth, while doing so profitably. And I look forward to sharing more about them with you overtime. Now with that let\u2019s open it up to your questions. Question: and: Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from John Faucher with JPMorgan. John Faucher : Want to talk a little bit about the pricing that you talked about, and I think you said it is going to come in on February 1st. Could you give us a little more of an idea -- and I apologize if I missed this -- where you are seeing that pricing going through sort of domestic versus international? And then given all the news about raw material deflation, et cetera, how you foresee competitive response on this pricing because we've seen a lot of talk about upticks and promotional spending going forward, so do you feel comfortable that the pricing is in and it is there to stay? Thanks. Benno Dorer : I think what you\u2019re referring is the 7% price increase on bleach which is domestic liquid bleach. We have a profitable growth focus as you know and really these costs are fully justified. We\u2019re seeing cost inflation in several areas whether that\u2019s transportation, logistics, corrugates, wages benefits and these are costs that not just Clorox sees but these are costs that are visible and occurring to our competitors in private label as well. I would like to remind you that we\u2019re pricing to a long-term cost advantage and not to a peak and again these are fully cost justified. We do have a strong track-record in pricing so over the last 10 years 95% of our pricing increases has stuck they are based on the analytics as well. And we\u2019re in the process talking to our retailers as we speak, so based on that strong track-record and the cost justification, we are confident that this price increase will be successful. At the same time, we\u2019ll always monitor what will happen in the marketplace, what will happen with competition and we\u2019re certainly also willing to spend back if needed to defend the business. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Chris Ferrara : I guess, Benno, can you talk a little bit about, I guess, the point one of the four points that you're saying you were leaning into, I guess, is accelerating portfolio momentum. Can you talk a little bit about how it is different, like what that might entail? Not necessarily specifics, but just generally what is different about that from what has been going on the last few years? Benno Dorer : Yes, Chris. I think what this will be about is really identifying the businesses that have the strongest tailwinds and ensuring that we have the right investments behind them. And I think the growth of Burt\u2019s Bees in the last quarter is perhaps a good example of what this will look like. We have for the first time launched a TV advertising campaign because we realized that the awareness behind the brand really has a lot of upside on the base business even though the brand has been around for 20 years and that\u2019s been leading to really nice results on the base business. We are leading into the investments behind innovations more strongly and we\u2019ve really seen how lip but also face innovation has yielded really nice results last quarter. And finally we\u2019re working with retailers to make sure we have the right in-store support out there, so really it is helping us understand where those tailwinds are, investing in those tailwinds behind the portfolio like Burt\u2019s Bees and like certain areas in Homecare and like food enhancers and using that to drive growth but growth the right way. Chris Ferrara : And just I guess on a near-term, you guys mentioned a couple of times that you are facing increasing tailwinds from economies around the world, but I guess that sort of leaves out your biggest economy where things look a little better and your category growth rate is getting better. So as you look forward, do you think generally your category growth rate globally across the portfolio is getting better or worse? I suspect that, right? Benno Dorer : Well, if you look at our largest market internationally Chris Latin America we actually are experiencing a slowdown in categories which even effects some of our strong growth markets like Peru and Chile and other markets of course like Argentina and Canada have been more stable for awhile, so I would say the general trend that we\u2019re watching very carefully and International is a slowdown economically in our categories. Now our market share in International is growing and as you\u2019ve seen an 11% sales increase in local dollars is nothing to sneeze at, but that\u2019s a headwind that we\u2019re watching very carefully. Chris Ferrara : And I am sorry I meant by your bigger economy I meant the U.S. which has been getting better, right? Benno Dorer : Yes, in the U.S. what we\u2019re seeing is certainly in the second quarter we\u2019ve seen a slight uptick. Our categories grew a little over 1% and that\u2019s up 0.5 a point from previous quarter, so that\u2019s good. And if you think about what\u2019s happening here in the U.S., you see indications of an increasing consumer confidence the University of Michigan just issued their consumer sentiment index its highest since 2004. I believe there is hope that there perhaps will be higher consumer spends due to lower oil prices. So those are good things at the same time household formation is still lower than it historically has been. The jobs that are created still pay less than the jobs that were lost during the recession and there still is this bifurcation in society where the bottom half isn\u2019t really doing well. So there is puts and takes I would say we\u2019re cautiously optimistic. Our expectation right now still are based on flat to low single-digit category growth and for us we focus on what we can control and that\u2019s investing in innovation we have a strong innovation plan also going out in Q3 of this fiscal year that we're investing behind and we talked to you in the past about increasing our demand spend by one point of net sales. Overtime that\u2019s called for by our strategy and we\u2019re certainly leaning into that focus on delivering better value than competitors and private label. So we feel like we're doing what we can do to drive category growth but I would like to let this play out in the marketplace for a quarter or two it's really too early to call it a positive trend. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong : Wanted to ask you a question about competition in your cleaning categories, particularly as one of your main competitors is not domiciled in the U.S., we have seen in our channel checks a lot more deals with Lysol, buy two get one free, those kinds of things, so just curious on your take on competition in your cleaning categories, particularly as one of your main competitors does have a little bit of a tailwind from not being in the U.S.? Thanks. Benno Dorer : Yes so competition in particular homecare Olivia has always been pretty strong and those types of deals that you described they are really nothing new, they occur relatively frequently and that\u2019s part of why we're saying that investing more in demand spending is the right thing to do. I will say though that for us the biggest category that we're competing with them in is wipes perhaps and if you look at the share results on wipes we're really up strongly in wipes and we feel like for us the right thing to do is focus on consumer fundamentals focus on demand spending that drives our brand equities on strong innovation and certainly in wipes we have a very strong innovation program and focusing on pointing out to the consumer that we're delivering superior value. That\u2019s really working in the marketplace that\u2019s what we'll be focused on and that\u2019s not to say that we won't respond appropriately if we feel like there is very strong trade promotion going on in the category we will defend our market shares. But I think we've always said that our focus is on earning market share and not buying market share and on wipes in particular that\u2019s playing out quite nicely at this point. So I would say the competitive dynamics in homecare are strong as they always have been. But I wouldn\u2019t call them elevated at this point. Olivia Tong : And then on Glad, it doesn't sound like you saw any pushback on your pricing and interestingly it sounds like volume increased while you took pricing, which doesn't typically happen. So was there some timing issue? Was there a big pre-buy ahead of price moves or have you just managed to increase volume while also taking on price as well? Benno Dorer : I would say the biggest thing on Glad Olivia is that we have certainly leaned into the price increase and merchandizing has been very strong last quarter. But also our innovation on Glad is really working well and in fact in Q3 we're backing this up with an innovation that we feel very strong about and that is in partnership with P&G we're launching Glad with a gain sense, the gain sense is one that has played well as a scent endorsement across various categories and we feel like this is another opportunity for us to support our strategy of differentiating our trash bags and encouraging trade-up by delivering something that\u2019s unique and very hard for our competitors to replicate. So in a nutshell really strong merchandizing but in particular very strong consumer expectance in this premium trash segments behind our innovations and as a result you've also seen our market share in this premium trash segment up quite nicely. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Steve Towers with UBS. Steve Towers : I guess just first on the commodity front, Steve, entertain me a little bit and think about a world where we are at sub $60 oil for the foreseeable future. I know it is early, but what does COGS deflation realistically look like in fiscal 2016? Is it negative 2%, 3%, 5%? And you mentioned potential offsets in terms of logistics costs going up and pricing promotional investments probably also going up in that world. But I just wonder if you could give us some guardrails as we think further out in terms of how you are thinking about the businesses preparing your fiscal 2016 budgeting given where oil is today? Steve Robb : Yes, it's a good question and the short answer is it's hard to know. A couple of things I would point out obviously oil has moved down pretty significantly over the last 90 days it\u2019s not clear how long it will stay down at these levels. So I think as we start looking at our fiscal '16 planning we'll have to take a hard look at how long will these prices really stay at today's level I think certainly for the next six months or so we expect them to be depressed beyond that I think it remains to be same. A couple of other things I would point out about the resin market the supply demand balance still remains fairly tight here in the U.S. and so resin prices have yet to come down actually in the first half of our fiscal year resin pricing was up. We do anticipate it'll go down in the second half, but that's mainly being driven by lower prices overseas and that's creating some downward pressure here in the U.S. so it's good but I would just temper expectations a bit to say it's not just energy prices it's also the supply demand balance. And then finally as you think of resin which is the largest commodity that we buy, keep in mind that historically in this category when you have seen a large move downward in resin pricing more than half of that has been spent back in the category and that's certainly what we're anticipating. So in short it\u2019s always better to have a tailwind than a headwind, but I think at this point we're cautiously optimistic on how that might play through in fiscal '16. Steve Towers : Okay. I'll leave that there. But I guess, Benno, maybe from a top-line perspective, as you say, the scanner data has certainly been picking up and looked a bit better, which is a positive, but not nearly to the extent that we see in your reported numbers this quarter. So how much of the Q2 strength is really attributable just to timing of sell-in versus sell-out? Do you think channel inventories are okay because you do seem to be pointing towards a deceleration in the second half that goes beyond the professional and international dynamics that you mentioned? Benno Dorer : Yes the first thing I'd say is keep in mind that the public share data doesn\u2019t capture the entire universe. We feel good about in the inventories that are out there there's nothing unusual in here. The two areas we're certainly watching is one is in Professional Products where we did see that Ebola concerns had some impact on that business that may lead to destocking in Q3 that'd be my expectation and then wipes certainly wipes have been up very strongly in that track channels. We don\u2019t think that Ebola had a big impact as the concerns faded away really quickly but the flu season certainly has been and is very strong, so we need to wait and see to understand whether that flows through to consumer consumption but other than that nothing particular inventories are where they need to be. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : So wanted to go back to, Steve, I think your comment about more than half of the commodity benefits are spent back and we have certainly seen that before, closer to 60%, maybe two-thirds is spent back. So I guess I am scratching my head still a little bit around the price increases that are theoretically justified on the bleach products and on wraps in particular. And I worry that you are asking for trouble in some sense because we see the spot market in resins, U.S. or abroad, it is coming down. It will likely come down and help you guys out, but also help your competitors. I'm just trying to figure out why you took that price increase and again if you're not just asking for a price gap expansion like you have gotten before in these categories and start getting hurt from a share all over again? Steve Robb : So Ali let me take that question. A few thoughts, first of all the price increases are cost justified I mean I would just point out when you look at the total supply chain whether it's a labor inflation, healthcare cost, transportation cost in particular or even all the other raw material set those have all been moving up so we try to price as Benno said to the long-term average cost so I think we feel both the bleach increase as well Glad is a cost justified price increase. Now as it relates to Glad as you know the resin market it actually tends to go up pretty quick and comes down slow it has been the history, but there's been a longstanding issue where if prices start to come down in the spot market for resin sometimes you'll see a step up in merchandising activity. Well that's certainly what we're planning for and it\u2019s certainly baked into the outlook and our expectations but I think we've done a long track-record of managing the ups and downs of resin pricing with the Glad business quite successfully so we have seen this story before we managed during the long-term cost and I think we feel pretty good about the decisions we have taken and if conditions are different than we think we'll manage through it. Ali Dibadj : I do want to go back a little bit to the lean in, I guess, on portfolio and try to get your sense of how comfortable you are with bags and wraps, professional and Burt's really leading the day. And on the one hand, it is great because it's diversification from your, \u201ca historical business or core business\u201d, but how do we think about that going forward and what are we going to hear about from your core and underlying businesses? And if you can tackle -- as you talk about portfolio -- the role of International because, of course, the main target we've been hearing about for a little while in terms of international is improving the margins there. And I get it; it is tough to tell with currencies. As best as we can tell, the margins are still going down or not getting that much better. So I am trying to understand how that fits in your portfolio? Does Clorox need to be an international company? Does it need to try to grow that business or should it just not? So both category portfolio, I guess and also international and geographic portfolio too, please. Benno Dorer : Yes so on category first I mean as you know if I take step back we're very focused on driving the core business right. If you look at the three businesses that you referenced Ali that grew last quarter two of them really have been growing strongly for a long time and we've always pointed out those two businesses Professional and Burt's Bees as growth areas and like I said we're leaning into investments and those investments are showing good returns. Glad I mean I probably wouldn't expect the growth rates that we've seen in the last quarter on Glad on a consistent basis going forward. But if I really look at underlying growth drivers that's innovation, the businesses where we had strong innovation they have grown. And as you know we're very focused on growing our business behind innovation and like I said we have a very strong innovation program out there also for the fiscal year back half. So we're growing, we're growing the right way and importantly if you look across the segments we're growing in all segments. So I feel good about how much we're focused on the core and which businesses are growing and I certainly would expect homecare also going forward to contribute more as Steve said we have just now a few days ago cycled through distribution loss with a major club customers, so that's the wipes growth that we're seeing in tracked channels hopefully will be visible also in shipments as we compare them versus year ago. On International I think what we said in International is that what we do want to do is grow more profitably. We're expecting a 5% to 7% in sales growth but we want to turnaround our margins. International has a role in Clorox, we're executing the fundamentals well but I will also remind everybody that we're not trying to transform the Company into more of a global player, it's 20% of our portfolio and if I project on forward to 2020, I don't expect that number to be significantly higher. Certainly as you think about the challenges that we're seeing from an inflation point of view and FX I think what it will mean is that we will be more focused than ever on the activities on the margin enhancement side whether that's pricing, whether that is margin accretive innovation, applying the strong cost savings focus that we have in the U.S. and International or this goes back to the accelerator that I mentioned moving the portfolio towards more profitable categories that really I think will become more of a focus going forward. How can we move our portfolio towards the categories that are more profitable and less perhaps volatile Burt's Bees is a good example and then certainly countries that are more economically stable and attractive like Peru and like Columbia, in and frankly also outside of Latin America. So International has a role but we will be very mindful to make sure that we grow but grow profitably. Ali Dibadj : If I can sneak in just one quick one about the cost savings and it looks like at least in Q1, Q2 versus last year the pace of it slowed a little bit. Just allay our fears about that, if you would please, or not? Benno Dorer : Ali I am happy to allay your fears. Cost savings in the gross margin you are probably looking at the Web attachments we had about 130 basis points of cost savings in gross margin keep in mind cost savings hits every line of the P&L, a good chunk of the cost savings this quarter came through our SG&A expenses. So in total for the quarter we had 27 million in cost savings and I would say we're certainly on-track to get 150 bps of EBIT margin expansion from the cost savings programs this year and continue to feel good about the pipeline going forward. So cost savings program is performing quite well for us. Operator : And we will move next to Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joe Altobello : First, just want to drill a little bit deeper on the volume number this quarter. Back of the envelope looks like Professional added about a point to volume, is that correct? Benno Dorer : The Professional Products business in terms of volume growth, no, the business was up double-digit in both volume and sales. Joe Altobello : Right, but in terms of your overall volumes it added about a point in the quarter? Benno Dorer : For the total company? Joe Altobello : Yes, exactly. Benno Dorer : That's right, sorry. Joe Altobello : Okay. And then in terms of the second half, I understand why that would slow, but, Benno, you talked about you're lapping the lost distribution in wipes, so you have easy compares there. And I think you are also lapping some easier compares on bleach as well. So would those two items help to offset the slowdown in professional, or that's probably not the case? Benno Dorer : I wouldn't overstate the slowdown in Professional. I mean the business was up double-digits in the second quarter obviously some of that maybe inventory that will get worked off in the third quarter but on balance we still think Professional Products would be in this 10% to 15% growth. I think as you look to the second half of the fiscal year here is how we're looking at it. The full year outlook for the Company is for sales growth of about 1%. Now on a currency adjusted basis it's probably in the range of 3% to 4%. Certainly in the first half of this fiscal we were at the higher end of that we came in at about 4% currency neutral sales growth. As we look to the second half I think we feel very good that we're on-track to have good positive volume growth, we're much on-track to have sales growth that's solid from an organic standpoint. I think the big wildcard that we're all watching pretty carefully is what happens with foreign currencies and again the outlook is 2% to 3% there but we could be at the mid or upper-end of that range kind of based on where the spot rates are today. But absent that I think the organic plans that we have are performing quite well for the Company. Joe Altobello : And then in terms of Brita, you mentioned a new pitcher came out in November. The filters came out in August, but it seems like that business hasn't picked up yet. You mentioned earlier on the call, you said it will be stronger in the second half, but I think in the past you talked about growth or a return to growth in the second half of that business. Am I sort of splitting hairs there, or do you still expect growth? Benno Dorer : Yes so, look I mean we expect that business to do better in the second half and we\u2019ve also said that on the share fronts we expect that to start growing again by perhaps middle of this year. The key will be for that innovation to take hold with consumer and the key will be to get better merchandizing plans with retailers and to be honest also support that innovation with the filter innovation with the right tools to get the price differential that we have compared to private labeled into the right place. So do expect a better half don\u2019t expect that business to grow strongly for the rest of the fiscal year but certainly better than in the first half of the fiscal. Operator : And we will move next to Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Wendy Nicholson : Just a tiny little point of clarification on Brita, how much of the business is the pitchers and the refill filters as opposed to the on-the-go portable business? Benno Dorer : The large majority is in pitchers and filters Wendy, on-the-go is a nice and growing business but it\u2019s relative small. Wendy Nicholson : Okay. Because the reason I asked, I sort of put it in the context of a bigger question about the Lifestyle segment and the margins there. We've seen margins up here in the first half of 2015, but over the last few years, the margins in that segment have come down a little bit and yet it is still a really profitable segment for you and I am just wondering, ballpark, competition in at least the on-the-go segment for Brita looks like it's going to get a little bit tougher now that Newell has made some acquisitions. It sounds like you are investing more on the advertising line for Bees. I don't know what is going on with margins in dressings and sauces, but I guess the question is how confident are you that that Lifestyle segment can sustain a margin 28% and above, if you will, a pre-tax margin? Benno Dorer : I think let me go ahead and take that I think we feel pretty good about the margins of Lifestyle what\u2019s true is over the last couple of years we\u2019ve made some investments and we have made investments in Burt\u2019s Bees and systems and processes so for a period of time that depressed the margins for Burt\u2019s Bees and Lifestyle segment we kind of cycled through that. We\u2019re also investing more to drive growth in that segment particularly on the Burt\u2019s Bees business. So the margins are fundamentally healthy I think we believe we\u2019ve got good opportunities to expand them overtime. But because they are such healthy margins leaning into the growth side of that Bees business certainly seems to right us and that\u2019s what you are saying. Wendy Nicholson : And so even when you're -- and I assume the gross margins on Bees are pretty good, so the incremental advertising is not materially going to move the needle on the EBIT margin or the pre-tax margin for Bees, is that fair to say? Benno Dorer : It\u2019s going to vary quarter-by-quarter we just turned on national advertising recently which is actually performing early days but it looks like it\u2019s performing quite well for us Burt\u2019s Bees business was up strong double-digits in the second quarter so it has very health gross margins. So if we have an opportunity to invest a bit more in consumer demand building investment in advertising to drive the top-line that\u2019s a good investment and something we\u2019ll do. I think again over the long-term we feel like both gross margins and EBIT margins are just fine for all the businesses and segment and Burt\u2019s Bees. Steve Robb : And Wendy as you know we\u2019re really focused on investing where we get the highest ROI and we got very solid analytics to understand where the ROI is best for the Company and investments in the said areas are based on what we know really show very solid ROI we\u2019re investing in the right areas. Operator : And we will move next to Michael Steib with Credit Suisse. Michael Steib : Steve, I wanted to follow up on your comments regarding free cash flow generation that improved significantly year-on-year in the first half and you have given us some of the reasons for that. I wonder how much of that is sustainable, is this a new level of cash generation for the Company, or were there some one-offs in there? Thanks. Steve Robb : The free cash flow was it\u2019s obviously been very good for the first half of this fiscal year and as I indicated in my opening comments we continue to believe that free cash flow as a percentage of sales should be about 10%. And I think over the long-term we\u2019ve been pretty consistently in both good and bad years in this 10% to 12% free cash flow as a percentage of sales. So, one of the things that we continued to do quite well within the Company is convert sales to cash and be very disciplined in the allocation of that cash and I am personally feeling very good about what we\u2019re doing in that space and have every reason to believe it will continue into the future. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets. Connie Maneaty : As you take a look at the portfolio and invest in the ones that give you the highest return, are there some brands or products that you would look to exit or deemphasize because they do cost money to run? And I am thinking -- I don't even know if Good is still around, but things like Green Works. So what is your opinion on the parts of the portfolio that won't be getting most of the future investment? Benno Dorer : Overall Connie we feel good about the portfolio and at the end of the day we\u2019re applying the same capabilities across the entire portfolio whether that\u2019s capabilities with the consumer or capabilities with customer or capabilities within the supply, and the synergies are pretty real, strong cash flow as Steve talked about, SG&A is comparatively low and ROIC is very strong. So I am very comfortable with the portfolio that we have, that isn\u2019t to say that we will always look with the Board on an annual basis at whether there is opportunities and whether we are still the highest value owner or not? And it\u2019s quite possible that we might be looking at some of the smaller businesses. But in general very comfortable with the portfolio and don\u2019t feel the need to do anything different. We want to grow bigger rather than smaller. And I think what we said is that we are interested in bolt on acquisitions to the tune of $25 million to $100 million in areas that are growth areas for us, and that are margin accretive on strategy, fit with our capabilities and that ideally are U.S. centric. So we are looking in whether that is health and wellness, or natural personal care or food enhancers and see if we can add, and that\u2019s really the mindset that we are in, while we will always be focused on growing the core business first. We think that there is places that we can play, that we are not playing in yet. And that\u2019s really our priority. Operator : And we will move to our next question from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Bill Schmitz : Can you just talk about the strategy accelerator process and what that means for the algorithm in terms of that 9%, 10% of sales in advertising and maybe the long-term growth rate? So do things change or is it zero-sum where you will move money out of places where it is less well spent and put into places where there might be better growth drivers? And then I have a follow-up, please? Benno Dorer : Bill, as you think about the accelerators, they have really spotlights on our strategy 2020. So I think it\u2019s very consistent with what we said during the leadership transition that, we are not expecting the strategies to change, but what we are focused on is a doubling down on choices that is strategy 2020 are called for. So I expect that the financial algorithm that we are after with strategy 2020 will be the same. Advertising sales promotion which I think is what you referenced Bill the idea of investing another point in our brands that will remain the same. So these are really ways for us to fully accomplish our 2020 strategy financial objectives, as opposed to a departure from them. Bill Schmitz : Okay. And then would you change any of the incentive compensation metrics around the strategy accelerators, so like the broader Company incentive compensation metrics? Benno Dorer : We haven\u2019t decided yet, that\u2019s early. But I don\u2019t see why our compensation metrics would be wrong even in this context. Again these are just ways for us to emphasize aspects of the strategy that we have really started to put in place about 16 months ago. So they are not a radical departure. So I don\u2019t expect that but we will always revisit that overtime also with the Board. Bill Schmitz : Okay, just to follow-up on the original question that Faucher asked, I think it was the first question, it seems like this promotional spending elevation in the front half of the calendar year is pretty consistent across the Companies that reported so far. It's a little bit coincidental, so I'm just wondering -- and obviously it is also impacting gross margin because of the higher gross to net -- is that really competitive-driven or are retailers starting to ask for some money back already because if you look at the Nielsen data, it doesn't seem like the percentage of ACV on deal, it's actually coming down, it is not going up? Steve Robb : I think as Benno had indicated I don\u2019t think the competitive landscape is changed that much over the last couple of months. What I would say is it\u2019s higher than it\u2019s been historically so it\u2019s a very intense competitive environment here in the U.S. As companies have taken some of their focus off, somebody\u2019s emerging markets have focused back on the U.S. But I wouldn\u2019t say that broadly it\u2019s more competitive than we saw say three or six months ago. All of that said the one trend that we are watching very carefully is this resin price which again if it starts to move lower which is what we anticipate historically what we have seen is a good percentage of that has been spent back into the category. But absent that and I think the landscape remains as intensely competitive as we talked to you three and six months ago. Bill Schmitz : Got you, so none of it\u2019s driven by retailers asking for more money back? Steve Robb : No, we haven\u2019t seen that. Operator : And we will take our next question from Erin Lash with Morningstar. Erin Lash : Building off an earlier question, I was wondering if you could speak to just the priorities for cash given the significant amount of free cash flow that you have been generating? Steve Robb : Yes the priorities are completely consistent with what we have been saying for many years now. We will support organic growth as Benno talked about keeping the core healthy. It\u2019s certainly working for us and it\u2019s something we are going to continue to do. We are interested obviously in M&A activity. If we can get businesses with 25 million to 100 million in sales that are margin accretive and have some tailwinds we are interested in that. As we\u2019ve talked in the previous call we feel very good about our debt-to-EBITDA, at the end of first quarter it was about 1.9 it\u2019s elevated as I indicated in the second quarter, but that\u2019s because we prefunded some debt but we certainly have dry powder I think which you should expect going forward is we will obviously keep the dividend healthy but if cash starts build up and we don\u2019t\u2019 have a use for it either for M&A or to support core growth probably in the form of share repurchases at some point will lean back into that to-date we\u2019ve been doing just some modest share buybacks earlier this fiscal year, but we haven\u2019t done much and we\u2019ve been more focused on refunding of the debt to-date. Erin Lash : And then within the advertising spending line, I was wondering if you could just talk about the degree to which you have been using digital I guess as a -- compared to traditional advertising means and how effective or how you are measuring the returns on that and where you see that going? Benno Dorer : Yes, digital right now is a little over 30% of our overall advertising sales promotion spend. That is as we understand the leading level in our industry and it\u2019s also up quite significantly over the last few years and again it\u2019s really based on a solid understanding of ROIs and the ROIs that we\u2019re getting in this space are really attractive. So we expect that shift to perhaps continue said that there is always going to be space for TV, TV continues to be a very effective driver of in particular awareness especially around innovations and like I said we feel good about our innovation program for the rest of fiscal year. But for us we call this what we need to be as always on we need to be where the consumer is no matter where she is in her purchase cycle and digital and social media is particularly suitable to help us accomplish that. So digital plays a very strong role and I expect that to keep going. Operator : And we\u2019ll move to our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Just two quick things, one was a follow-up on the promotional environment question. I still just am not sure why the commentary on an increase in trade promotion in the back half of the year versus prior expectations because I would've thought that -- you were saying if resin prices come down, you will be watching it, so I would think that is more of a fiscal \u201916 dynamic than something in the next six months, so anything you can add there would be great? Steve Robb : Yes, to clarify I think as I indicated in my opening comments, the increase in trades for promotional spending is a full year number. I mean it\u2019s likely we will spend a bit more in the second half but it\u2019s mainly a full year comment. I think what\u2019s important is we\u2019re agnostic on whether it\u2019s trade or advertising, what we\u2019re looking for is the highest returns and what resonates the most with the consumers, so whether that\u2019s advertising, freight promotion or other things. We will be investing more we\u2019re trying to get to this one point at the incremental demand building investment as a percentage of sales overtime and so we\u2019re going to spend more I think is probably the key takeaway, but you will see it fall in different lines of the P&L at different times. Benno Dorer : And Lauren, adding to Steve\u2019s point a significant portion of trade promotion also is going against innovations really to make sure that we drive strong merchandizing and trail out of the gate for those. Lauren Lieberman : And then my second question was just actually on the professional products business. I think you have been clear on watching for any kind of destock in the third quarter, but I was just curious if you think that the recent phase of worries around Ebola and Enterovirus, has that perhaps pushed some of the cleaning standards and protocols and making changes higher on the priority list of some of the healthcare service industry than it was previously? Like could this be a sort of watershed event in terms of raising the profile of what you are trying to do? Benno Dorer : I mean we certainly haven\u2019t see that Lauren and I think the cleaning protocols have been in place and what hospitals have been doing is just apply a cleaning protocols and make sure that they\u2019re prepared for a potential increase in use or around our products to coincide with these cleaning protocols, so do we expect heightened awareness and does it help us? I have a dialogue with hospitals going forward around these and what our products can deliver, we hope so, but we certainly haven\u2019t seen that in Q2 and we\u2019ll have to see how it plays out. But clearly we think that this is a growth category and that\u2019s why we\u2019re investing in it. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante : A question with regards to the U.S. again and I think that it was alluded earlier in the call, but I would like to, if it is possible, to get more clarification, has to do with the growth in the U.S. I know that the hospital part probably added a point, but still that means that growth in retail sales in non-tracked channels probably grew well over 10%. And I wonder whether you can tell us which particular brands, or what kind of retail format is growing -- you guys are finding new points of distribution to be posting that kind of growth and to what extent there were one-timers, promotional one-timers, other than the one that was described when it came to Ebola? Thank you. Steve Robb : Javier let me lead off on this I would characterize the growth as broad-based I think we had some very good promotions that were in place that have been planned like cold and flu and leaning into those. But I wouldn\u2019t point to any single thing other than in the Professional space we had strong double-digit growth and some of that is probably hospitals building up inventory out of the concerns for Ebola. I think the U.S. growth was amazingly broad-based and we have talked Professional Products we have talked Glad we have talked Burt\u2019s Bees which was up and mostly the other businesses had a very solid quarter. So I think it was a clean set of numbers and there is not anyone thing I can point to. And even from a retailer standpoint it's again not any specific channel I think it was just across the board it was solid healthy growth for the Company. Benno Dorer : Yes for me Javier I would really say that the two things I would point to that led to this broad-based growth as Steve said are one innovation and two the increase in demand spend and even on businesses that perhaps benefited from flu that\u2019s based on long-term planning with retailers and we saw just very strong merchandized execution behind long planned events that certainly benefited from somewhat [Audio Gap] but it's really been about innovation and increase in demand spend and there is nothing funky about this growth at all. Operator : And we will take a follow-up question from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets. Connie Maneaty : The cost pressures that led to the price increase in bleach seem to be pretty generic and not really limited to bleach, so Healthcare costs, wage inflation, logistics, all of that. So should we expect price increases then in a broader part of your portfolio going forward? Steve Robb : Connie I think what we said the inflationary pressures are obviously pretty real and the increases that we previously mentioned are the kind that tend not to reverse themselves. I think most of the pricing we've taken to-date has really been focused on the International markets where we're dealing with much higher rates of inflation. You'll continue to see us lean into that. On the U.S. side again where it\u2019s cost justified and pricing to a long-term average cost we will continue to take pricing as Benno noted we've got a very long track-record of doing this and balancing it with value. I will say forward looking that one thing that has worked for us that we want to continue is trying to marry up pricing with innovation because I think if you can bring those two things together it translates into good value for the consumer here itself and it tends to do much better. So short answer is we're not afraid to take pricing in the U.S. when it\u2019s cost justified we would like to avoid it when we can and certainly marry it up with innovation. But we feel like the recent price increases we have taken are the right ones for the long-term. Benno Dorer : And to build on Steve's point and I think you mentioned it Steve so we will remain focused on value, value of course is a function of pricing but also investing in our brands and also having innovation out there and delivering superior products all that won't change. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session Mr. Dorer I would now like to turn the program back to you. Benno Dorer : Yes thanks everyone. To sum up, I feel very good about the second quarter and what was really a solid first half performance. And I have confidence in our plans for the balance of the year. And I certainly look forward to speaking with you again on our next call in May. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Erin Lash - Morningstar Research Operator : Good day, ladies and gentleman, and welcome to The Clorox Company Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, you may begin your conference. Steven Austenfeld - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining Clorox's third quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, Colorx's CEO, and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com. Let me remind you that on today's call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt-to-EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website, as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release. Please recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. So with that, I'll start by covering highlights of our third quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and updated financial outlook for fiscal year 2015. And finally, Benno will provide his perspective, and then we will open it up for your questions. Please recognize that all of today's commentary is on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise stated. Turning to our top-line results, in Q3 volume was up 1% and sales grew 3%, including the impact of 2 points of unfavorable foreign currencies, with the largest impact coming from Argentina, Canada and Australia. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies, sales grew 5%. Our growth reflects higher volume and favorable mix as well as a nearly 3-point benefit from price increases. Importantly, our sales results reflect growth across all U.S. segments and international on a currency-neutral basis. In Q3, our U.S. 13-week market shares increased three-tenths of a point versus the year-ago quarter. This is the largest market share increase in the past four years and reflects share growth in six of our eight tracked categories. Our third quarter increase reflected strong gains in our Home Care and Laundry businesses, with Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and Clorox liquid bleach leading the way. Brita, Glad, Charcoal and Burt's Bees also grew market share in the quarter. Conversely, we saw market share declines in our cat litter business as competitive intensity remained high. To address the challenges in our Litter business, we continue to drive our new lightweight product, along with harder-hitting advertising and packaging claims on our overall Fresh Step business. In addition, we have innovation coming out in the cat litter category that we anticipate will result in improved share trends in calendar year 2016. Looking at our U.S. categories, they were up 2 points in the third quarter, a strong improvement following the 0.5 gain we saw in Q1 and more than 1 point gain that we saw in Q2. We are continuing to invest to improve our category trends, and strengthening our market shares remains a top priority. With that, I'll review our third quarter results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q3 volume grew 1% primarily due to strong results in our Home Care business. Sales also grew 1% with gains across all Cleaning segment businesses. In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased 1% behind strong execution of merchandising events, particularly for Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, along with strong performance of new wipes with micro-scrubbers that we began shipping at the start of the fiscal year. While it's too early to get a definitive read on performance, sales also benefited from the launch of three new products : Clorox ScrubSingles, Clorox Triple Action Dust Wipes and Clorox Pump 'N Clean. Our Professional Products business grew sales 3% in the third quarter, particularly behind increased shipments in our food service channel. As we discussed last quarter, following double-digit Q2 sales growth behind Ebola and enterovirus concerns, we anticipated some slowdown in third quarter Professional Products growth as those concerns abated. Looking ahead, we anticipate our Professional Products business will continue to grow faster than the company average. In our Laundry business, sales increased 1% due to growth from Clorox liquid bleach and Clorox 2 Stain Fighter & Color Booster. As noted last quarter, due to increased input costs we implemented a 7% average price increase on Clorox bleach, effective February 1. The price increase was well executed in the market. However, competitors have been somewhat slow to follow. From a market share standpoint, our strong execution is paying off as Q3 marked the fifth consecutive quarter of market share growth on Clorox bleach. In our Household segment, volume was flat while sales increased 5%. The segment's top-line results were driven by strong performance in our Charcoal businesses, which grew volume and sales at a double-digit rate on top of high-single-digit growth in the year-ago quarter. Charcoal's strong top-line results were driven by converting to a new and improved lightweight product that began shipping in January, supported by increased demand-building investments as well as strong early-season performance at key retailers. Our Bags and Wraps business grew sales 1%, driven by innovation behind the new Gain scented trash bags through our partnership with Procter & Gamble. Volume on Glad declined 9%, reflecting the impact of price increases taken last March and November on our trash bag business. Although competition has not yet followed, we continue to believe our pricing actions are right for the long term with signs the resin market is firming up. In addition, we anticipate reinvesting a portion of our pricing benefit in trade spending to manage price gaps and to invest in innovation on our premium lines of business. Cat Litter volume and sales decreased 3% and 2%, respectively, in the face of competitive activity. We're continuing to invest aggressively in innovation and communicating our value proposition versus the competition, particularly focusing on excellent clumping and odor control such as with Fresh Step's eliminate-odor-for-10-days claim that comes with a money-back guarantee. In our Lifestyle segment, volume grew 2% while sales grew 3%. These results were driven by high-single-digit sales growth on Burt's Bees, largely due to innovation in lip and face care products. In particular, our new lip crayons grew strongly in the quarter, supported by new Burt's Bees television advertising, as did our renewal of face line, facial towelettes and skin brightening products. Looking to the fourth quarter, sales growth will likely be well within year ago as we lap the strong merchandising and pipeline build for the lip crayon products. Full-year results for Burt's Bees continue to track to high-single-digit growth, and we look forward to another strong year in fiscal 2016. Turning to our Food business, volume grew 1% and sales grew 2% versus the year-ago quarter behind higher volume of bottled and dry Hidden Valley products, including the February launch of five new flavored Hidden Valley Ranch dressings and two new Greek yogurt dry dip and dressing mixes. Partially offsetting the Burt's Bees and Food gains where lower sales and shipments of Water Filtration products due to category softness and intense competition in pour-through filters. As previously communicated, we started shipping an improved Brita filter in August. It is faster and easier to change than competitive filters and is getting strong reviews in e-commerce channels. In November, we began shipping improved pitchers. We're keenly focused on getting our consumer messaging right and, coupled with our focus on innovation, we're optimistic that our Water Filtration business will improve in fiscal year 2016. Turning to International, volume was up 1% and sales were flat, reflecting the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies, sales for International grew 10%. In the quarter, International saw market share gains in Canada in local currency terms and we grew volume share in Latin America, particularly in bleach and cleaners. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to see slowing economic growth in some of our key markets such as Chile and Peru, given macroeconomic trends such as high inflation and slow GDP growth. That said, we remain committed to growing profitably in our International markets as we continue to carefully assess spending across geographies and implement price increases to partially mitigate the macroeconomic headwinds. Looking at the balance of fiscal year 2015, as noted in this morning's press release we've increased our sales growth outlook for the year to be in a range of 1% to 2%. The revised sales outlook takes into account the strength seen year-to-date. For the fourth quarter, we continue to anticipate strong foreign exchange headwinds along with higher trade spending to support our categories and grow market shares, as well as to defend against reduced prices by competitors. Now I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q3 financial performance and updated financial outlook for fiscal year 2015. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Steve. And welcome, everyone. We're pleased to have delivered another good quarter, following a solid first half of fiscal 2015. As you saw in our press release, given our results to date we've raised our fiscal year outlook for sales and updated earnings per share from continuing operations. Now we'll turn to our financial results for the quarter. In our third quarter, sales grew 3%, reflecting 3 points of pricing, a little over 1 point of favorable mix and assortment, and nearly a point of volume growth. These factors were partially offset by 2 points of unfavorable foreign exchange and 1 point of higher trade spending. On a currency-neutral basis, sales grew 5%. Gross margin for the quarter increased 110 basis points to 43.2%, reflecting 170 basis points of cost savings and 140 basis points of pricing benefit. These factors were partially offset by 120 basis points of increased manufacturing and logistics costs and about 60 basis points of higher performance-based incentive compensation cost. For the quarter, commodity costs were about flat. Selling and administrative expenses increased 16% in the third quarter to 14.7% of sales compared to 13% of sales in the year-ago quarter. This increase was driven primarily by a significantly higher performance-based compensation costs reflecting higher anticipated year-over-year payouts, which recognizes the company's strong performance to date. While the largest impact from higher incentive compensation costs was reflected in selling and administrative expenses, it also resulted in higher cost of goods sold and research and development expenses. Importantly, for the full fiscal year, we continue to anticipate that selling and administrative expenses to be about 14% of sales, consistent with our long-term target. Advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was nearly 9% of sales, with U.S. spending for the quarter at about 10% of sales, reflecting continued strong support for our U.S. businesses. Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.08, a $0.06 decrease versus the year-ago quarter due largely to the higher year-over-year incentive compensation costs. As a reminder, in the year-ago period earnings had a $0.12 benefit due to unusually low incentive compensation costs; again, consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. Fiscal year-to-date free cash flow was $398 million compared with $357 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 11%. In keeping with our practice to return excess cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases, fiscal year to date the company has repurchased about 1.5 million shares of common stock at a cost of approximately $158 million. Now I'll turn to our updated outlook for fiscal year 2015. As Steve mentioned, we raised our fiscal year sales outlook, which now anticipates sales growth in the range of 1% to 2%, reflecting stronger results to date and an impact of more than 2 percentage points from unfavorable foreign currencies. Our sales outlook also reflects slowing international economies, increased trade spending as we continue to support our brands. Turning to margin, we continue to anticipate moderate gross margin expansion for the fiscal year as the benefit of cost savings and pricing are expected to more than offset higher manufacturing and logistics costs. We also continue to anticipate that commodity costs will be about flat for the full year as year-to-date headwinds should be offset by lower commodity costs in the fourth quarter. As I previously mentioned, we continue to anticipate selling and administrative expenses at about 14% of sales. EBIT margin is expected to be about flat, reflecting moderate gross margin expansion offset by higher performance-based incentive compensation costs. Our fiscal year EBIT margin also reflects incremental demand-building investments. We continue to anticipate fiscal 2015 tax rate on earnings from continuing operations to be about 34%. And net of all of these factors, we have updated our fiscal year outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to $4.45 to $4.55. As we look ahead to fiscal year 2016, we're going to be keenly focused on three things. First, headwinds in international markets, including slowing economies and foreign currency declines, which we anticipate to be higher than this year's expected level of more than 2% and will impact both top- and bottom-line results. In particular, we anticipate a meaningful currency devaluation in Argentina sometime in fiscal year 2016. Second, we continue to monitor changes in commodity costs. Despite the current softness in resin prices, we're seeing early signs that the market may be firming up. In addition, logistics costs remain high, which will likely continue into next year. And third, we will invest heavily in our brands. As I mentioned previously, historically we've invested a portion of the resin-related savings back into the business. In particular, we anticipate continuing to invest in trade promotion, especially in categories where competitors have yet to follow our pricing actions. As a reminder, we will provide our outlook for fiscal year 2016 in early August. In closing, I feel really good about our results this quarter despite the headwinds we continue to face. We continue to be encouraged by the actions we're taking to accelerate growth in our U.S. businesses and plan to continue investing. In addition, our team drove operational efficiencies that allowed us to expand our margins, which supports our focus on driving profitable growth. With that, I will turn it over to Benno. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Steve, and hi, everyone. We're pleased to have delivered strong third quarter results on top of a very solid first half. As we've shared with you, the central aspect of our 2020 strategy is to drive profitable growth. And consistent with that strategy, while facing significant foreign exchange headwinds and cost increases, in Q3 we focused on growing profitably through strong execution of our Desire, Decide and Delight demand-building model based on delivering better value to consumers; through launching meaningful innovations across many categories; increasing brand investments in the U.S.; delivering strong cost savings; and executing price increases where they are justified. As a result, we drove category and overall market share improvements and saw further revitalization of our U.S. retail business. We generated stronger top-line results. We expanded gross margin. And we raised our sales outlook and updated our EPS outlook for the fiscal year. Now as we look ahead to fiscal year 2016, I remain confident in our strategy and our keen focus on accelerating profitable growth to create value for our stockholders. The strategy accelerators I shared with you last quarter are driving decisions around where we will invest more heavily; again, with the intent to drive profitable growth. By accelerating portfolio momentum, we're taking advantage of tailwinds to generate more growth from our portfolio and invest more heavily against those brands and categories that have a stronger right to grow. We're pleased to see this reflected in our Q3 share growth, which was the strongest we've seen in four years. By accelerating 3D technology transformation, we're addressing the shift in how today's consumers shop and buy their products and how we must engage with them. As we focus on winning the battle for the physical and virtual shopping cart, we've solidified partnerships with key retailer partners to accelerate our e-commerce strategy. By accelerating innovation across our demand-creation model of Desire, Decide and Delight, we are driving category growth. I'm pleased with the progress we're making. And this quarter, we launched meaningful innovation across several categories. Although early days, several of these are exceeding expectations. And finally, by accelerating our growth culture while maintaining operational excellence, we're driving an even more deeply-ingrained growth mindset. I believe these are the right strategies, particularly as we manage our business in the face of challenges that Steve Robb noted earlier : slowing economies in international markets and strong foreign exchange headwinds, a volatile commodity market, and the need to continue to invest in trade promotions to support our brands against competition. And with that, we'll open it up to your questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Dorer. Our first question will come from Steve Powers of UBS. Steve R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Hi, Benno, Steve, and Steve. I wanted to ask a question around the gross margin guidance, Steve. I'm not sure how you define moderate expansion. But if I take your full-year guidance of 1% to 2% in the top line and assume, just as a starting point, Q4 gross margin looks like Q3 in terms of expansion, that's going to put your gross margin performance for the year up about 40 basis points, if my math is correct. So I guess first does 40 basis points line up as moderate for you? And then second, is there any reason why gross margin expansion shouldn't actually accelerate in Q4, given the magnitude of the presumed commodity benefits and the continued cost saves? I know you flagged the higher trade promotion in your outlook a couple of times. And I'm assuming that's particularly focused on Glad, where you've got the price gap issue. But just how significant a spike in gross to net are you expecting in Q4, if you can size that order of magnitude versus Q3? Thanks. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. We are expecting a meaningful improvement in gross margins in the fourth quarter. Obviously, we're very pleased with the results we saw in the third quarter where we added almost a little over a full point of gross margin. And what we saw in the third quarter, and this is relevant to the fourth quarter, strong cost-savings programs, pricing actions that are working in the market. In the third quarter, commodity costs were flat. And so all those benefits flowed through. When you look forward to the fourth quarter, we feel great about the pricing. We feel very good about the cost savings. And importantly, we expect to get some commodity cost tailwinds, okay, and that will probably be the first quarter this year where we're actually getting tailwinds, so I would expect a meaningful gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter. Now for the full year, stepping back, we do expect EBIT margin to be about flat. And the reason for that is we are going to continue to step up our investments in consumer demand-building investments, and our SG&A costs are expected to be about 14% for the full year. So I think some of the benefit in the fourth quarter in gross margin will be offset by some of these other factors, but nonetheless you should see some pretty nice numbers. Steve R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : And I guess just to square that with moderate expansion and in terms of language of your outlook, if you're up meaningfully in the fourth quarter, sounds like at least as much as the third quarter, that's 50 basis points or so. That's going to be a sizeable \u2013 is that what you define as moderate gross margin expansion? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Steve, I'll let you do your math. I'll let you apply your judgment. Keep in mind, the first half was a bit more challenging for us. Second half, as we expected, gross margins are expected to do better. We're seeing it in the third quarter. We'll see it again in the fourth quarter. And I think, again, for the year you're going to see some good margin expansion at the gross margin line, but EBIT margins should be about flat. Steve R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And is there any way to frame or \u2013 Steve mentioned a couple of times increasing trade spends. You got increasing investments throughout the press release. You talk about higher trade promotion in your outlook. You flagged the price gap issue in Glad. So how much incremental investment should we be thinking about relative to the Q3 run rate as we look forward on that trade promo line? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, let me step back and just talk about the full year for a second in long term. First, you might recall that on our 2020 strategy, one of the things that we wanted to do was to invest in incremental point of sales in consumer demand-building investment and to some extent in R&D. We started that in the fourth quarter of last year. I think we've continued it through this year. So I think what you should expect is a mix of both trade spending as we're looking to drive trial and repeat on new products, as well as just advertising as we keep those brands healthy. But I think you'll see us consistently do this over the coming quarters. But again, full year you should see a nice increase, consistent with what you've seen year to date. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And Steve, this is Benno. One thing I would add is that you should see the incremental dollars probably float around depending on where they deliver the ROI, depending on the strategic needs at any given point. Right now, it's fair to say that more dollars go into trade promotion, one, to support the price increases, but two, also to support fast distribution startup behind what is a really solid innovation program. Over time, that might change and the dollars might go into different buckets. But as Steve Robb said, this increase in spend is going to be here to stay and in line with our strategies. Steve R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll hear next from Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good afternoon, folks. Thank you for the question. I wanted to focus on your International business quickly. I know you've made a lot of investments in the recent years or taken a lot steps, I should say, in recent years to try to improve the profitability \u2013 walking away from Venezuela, the SAP investment. Yet looking at profitability I think from a margin perspective, this quarter marked a new all-time low. So can you talk more \u2013 I know FX is a pressure point here, but from just a profitability perspective, what's driving the ongoing erosion? What can you do to maybe fix it, and what's a realistic expectation as we think about the forward there? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Jason, thank you for that. Well, our long-term aspiration in International is to grow 5% to 7% in sales but importantly grow profitably. And it's fair to say that at this point we're not meeting those expectations. I would say that operationally we're executing well, but we all know this is a very challenging environment that will likely continue well into next fiscal year. The key drivers, to your question, a lot of them are macroeconomic in nature around GDP, around cost inflation, price controls and FX. Again, these are factors that our peers are seeing as well, and they're pretty well established. Going forward, our focus will be on rebuilding margin. I'm not happy about the profitability, and rebuilding margin is our first priority. I would point at a few key tactics. One, continued pricing to offset inflation. Two, innovation where margin accretive that drives trade up, and we're seeing good results behind tactics like this in markets like Argentina and there's more that we can and will do. Three, we will really be very disciplined about demand spending. We will spend where it is profitable and where we feel like there's going to be a long-term growth effect. We will not spend if the profitability is not there. And then fourth, we have intensified our efforts to apply what we think is a solid playbook from the U.S. on the cost-savings side, and we will do more of that. So going forward, I do not expect us to be on the growth trajectory, the 5% to 7% in sales growth that I mentioned earlier, any time soon. But I do think that we can do better to start rebuilding our margin, and that again will be our priority near term given all the challenges that are largely macroeconomic in nature. Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. One follow-up and then another question. Some of the cost-relief benefits that you're expecting in the U.S., would you expect to see them in International as well, or is FX going to be a full offset? And then real quick on top line, you bumped it from 1% to 1% to 2% for the year, with only one quarter left. That's a pretty wide range. It implies sort of down 2% to plus 2% for the fourth quarter. Plus 2% seems like it should be pretty much \u2013 it should be a pretty achievable target. So the question is why not just go from 1% to 2%, or is there real risk that your top line is materially weaker than just 2% in the fourth quarter? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. Jason, let me start with the latter question and then I'll step back and address the former. Starting with the latter question, which is regarding the outlook. Again, the outlook for sales growth for the full year is 1% to 2% all-in, including foreign currencies. Now to be clear, fiscal year-to-date we've delivered about 2% sales growth, a little over 2% sales growth all-in. I think as we look to the fourth quarter, we are expecting sales growth to be probably flat to up slightly. The things that we're monitoring carefully right now, number one, is just foreign currencies. There's a lot of volatility there. Second, our Charcoal business, which by the way is off to a great start certainly in the third quarter, but it's a seasonal business. It's historically had some volatility, so we'll need to see how that plays out. And then finally we're going to continue to invest in our business. So I think on balance it's fair to say, based on what we know, that we're probably in the mid to upper end of that range of the 1% to 2%. Turning to your question on International, it is challenging because you've got foreign exchange, which is certainly placing a drag on the margins in our International business because, like many companies that have businesses in the emerging markets, you pay for a lot of your costs in dollars. And as a result you take a double hit on that. We are seeing benefits of lower commodity costs beginning to trickle through to International, but probably to a less extent than we're seeing in the U.S. because the inflationary pressures are higher in the International markets, and where possible we try to source materials locally and try to pay in local currency. So I think the margin challenges in International are a bit more acute. And I think as Benno said, that's why we're going to focus on what we can control. We're going to lean into pricing. We're going to continue to drive hard against our cost savings. We're going to get smart about how we allocate our investment spend. And then finally, I think there is more opportunity to lower SG&A costs globally but particularly in International, and you'll see us focus on that as well. Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks a lot. I'll pass it on. Operator : Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, your line is open. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Good afternoon. I just wanted to talk a little bit about commodities because you obviously started to see that turn this quarter and just kind of get a better sensing of what you were thinking sort of for 2016 in terms where that can go. And then also on the logistics costs, I know there are a lot of factors that go in there, but just wondering if you could provide more color as that number moves around. Is that just continuing higher truck and rail costs, or is there something else that we should be thinking about? Thanks. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So let me start with the logistics question, Olivia. What we have seen \u2013 and this is not unique to Clorox. As we've talked many times before, there's two fundamental problems in logistics that everybody is facing \u2013 simply not enough drivers and trucks. Part of that is changing rules and regulations. Part of it is probably a fallout from the economic slowdown. A lot of trucking companies went out of businesses. There's just not enough trucks on the road, and rail has been somewhat congested. And so that's been driving up overall logistics costs. I think this area may be impacting Clorox a bit more though than other companies because some of our plants are in more rural locations. We have longer shipping lanes, and we also tend to ship things like bleach and charcoal and cat litter, which weigh a bit more and so you pay a bit more there. So it's an ongoing pressure. It's something that we fully expect will continue through next year, which is why again we're focusing on pricing and cost savings to address it. In terms of the outlook for commodity costs, again as I said in my opening comments, we anticipate commodity costs to be about flat on the year. But we do expect to get some tailwinds in the fourth quarter. What we're watching very carefully right now is energy prices. Energy prices over the last four weeks to eight weeks have moved up pretty sharply. And one of the things we know over time is that commodity costs tend to come down slowly but they move up pretty quickly And so resin prices appear to have found a bottom. They're starting to firm up. I do expect that in the fourth quarter there'll be some tailwinds. And there might be some tailwinds going into early fiscal 2016. But we're just keeping a sharp eye on this because these markets have a tendency to swing pretty quickly. But we'll have a better update for you in early August when we provide our outlook for fiscal 2016. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thanks. And then on bleach pricing, you mentioned that you're gaining share but if private label doesn't end up following in the pricing, what's the game plan there? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Olivia. So for everybody, as a reminder, we took a 7% price increase in February. Our price increase was executed successfully. And on the competitive side, I would say at this point it's early days and we need to let this play out. Some accounts did follow on the private label side, some not yet. So it's not clear where this will end up. I would offer a few pieces of perspective. First of all, the price increases continue to be cost-justified. Our competitors see the same cost increases that we do. So again, early days, we need to let this play out. We do have a strong track record obviously taking price increases over the long term. We know how to execute pricing and we're certainly committed to growing our categories profitably. We had anticipated the need to spend some of the pricing benefit back in trade promotion. This is exactly what's happening. This is exactly what is reflected in our outlook. So we are staying the course on pricing on bleach, and also on Glad for that matter, but we'll also stay agile if needed. So if we need to course-correct down the road, we will. But at this point, my expectation is that this price increase will be executed successfully. We'll probably see, also as a disclaimer, volumes and shares over a few quarters be somewhat depressed. Again, that's a normal thing, and after three quarters to four quarters, once consumers are used to new price points, we should see that ease up and normalize. But overall I would say the price increases are on track. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thanks a bunch. Operator : We'll hear next from Joe Altobello from Raymond James. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. First, I guess since we're on bleach, I'll start there in terms of a housekeeping question. You mentioned that Glad volumes were down 9% after the price increase. And I'm not sure you gave the bleach volume number in your prepared remarks. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Our Laundry business in total, and that includes Clorox 2, it was down, from a volume standpoint, mid-single digits. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. So as expected, I would think. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : As expected. There was no surprise there for us, as Benno said. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And in terms of Litter and Brita, obviously you guys have struggled in both of these areas of late. And it sounds like they're moving in opposite directions. It seems like Brita's getting a little bit better. And I'm curious, number one, has that business turned a corner, or is still a lot of wood to chop there? And two, how do you guys fix Litter? And I know this is a very tough question you've been asking for probably three years now. But it's not for lack of spending, and it's not for lack of innovation but that business continues to decline. So I'm just curious if there is something that we haven't heard from you guys yet that you're thinking about to try to turn around that business. Thanks. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Joe. Thanks. Brita first, Brita has been soft recently, and certainly on the share side we're seeing some improvements. It's, to be honest, too early to say that we've turned a corner but I'm certainly feeling better. The issue on Brita has been private label filter distribution expansion, which led our share and volume to be under pressure and also has led the category to a decline. We are focused on innovation, innovation on systems but also innovation on filters to differentiate from private label. That work is underway and we're seeing good progress. We're also working with retailers to reverse the trade downs in the category and revitalize the category. And I expect better results in fiscal year 2016. The good news is on Brita that our pour-through systems, which is the majority of the business, is growing and that's typically a precursor to higher filter sales. So that's the green shoots and I think Brita will see growth in the next fiscal year and I'm quite optimistic. Litter, obviously no surprise, not yet where we want it to be. What we've always said is that it will take a few quarters until we can expect improvements. And I will say that I think that it will take until fiscal year 2016 also. We're focused on earning share and not buying share, which ultimately requires better innovation. We've put a few things in place that are beginning to take hold. We're investing in better value communication. Lightweight litter, which we've launched earlier this fiscal year, has been quite successful and we're investing behind it. And as Steve Austenfeld said earlier in the call, we have strong innovation coming up in the next fiscal year, which is ultimately what it will take. So pleased with the progress. I'd also offer as a perspective that Litter is growing both volume and sales fiscal year-to-date. So that share number is certainly the one number that I don't like and no one here at Clorox likes. But to put it in perspective, we're nevertheless growing and we feel good about our prospects for 2016 and beyond. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Benno. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Joe. Operator : Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank, please go ahead. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Hey, the first question, a couple of housekeeping items. The first is the corporate line in the segment data has been super bouncy, and I think a lot of that is incentive comp. But when you look forward, is the right number like $60 million a quarter? Is that about right? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You're right in your first conclusion, which is incentive \u2013 it includes a lot of things, interest income and expense and other things. But incentive compensation is really what's causing it to move around, and you're going to see variability across the quarters. The simplest way I'd have you, if you're modeling this out, model this year SG&A cost at about 14% of sales I think is right. And I think again, as we've said many times, over the longer term we'd like to get that number below 14%, but that might be the easiest way to think of this. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, the reason I asked the question is I know you're not going to give us guidance for next year, but there's a really difficult comp on the corporate line in the first quarter. And I think if you look at the Street numbers, if you kind of normalize it to the regular corporate number, the number is like $0.10 too high. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I haven't seen the consensus for the first quarter, so I really can't comment on that. Again, all I can say is that, for modeling purposes, you're going to see variability across the quarters in SG&A cost, as we previously discussed, and 14% is probably a really good number to use at this point. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then the net-debt-to-EBITDA now is like 1.5 turns, and I think that's fairly below where you guys kind of feel comfortable. So what's the plan on the sort of balance sheet utilization front? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. At the end of the third quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA came in at 1.9, okay? So it's certainly... Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: (43:07) Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I understood. Understood. Yeah. We look at \u2013 you've got to also remember some of that cash is overseas and somewhat trapped. So we like to think of it as about a 1.9 against the target of 2 to 2.5. In any case, our free cash flow fiscal year to date is up 11% versus year ago. So we're certainly feeling very good about our ability to convert sales to cash. And it gives us a lot of financial flexibility. We've started to use some of that money, as we've discussed for the last few quarters, to invest for growth and we've been putting more money into growth and it's certainly working. We're going to keep the dividend healthy. But you saw us in the third quarter re-enter the market for share repurchases essentially to start offsetting stock option dilution that's occurred over the last couple of quarters. I think longer term what you'll see us do is we'll continue to obviously support the growth of our business organically with investments. We continue to look for bolt-on acquisitions in the areas that we've discussed and we'll keep the dividend healthy and return cash that we don't need back to the shareholders. So we're certainly sitting in a very good spot with a lot of financial flexibility. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got you. And I know some people complain that I ask too many questions on these calls. But the last one is it seems like finally like the scan to non-scan channels are aligned. Is that going to be the case going forward? So is the sort of Costco stuff lapped and now it seems like, by channel, things are kind of growing at the same rate? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Should be, yes. So as you rightly say, Bill, the Costco matter, we're through. That happened in Q3 of last year. So we should see, barring any unforeseen events, scan to non-scan to be reasonably aligned, yeah. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks so much, guys. Operator : We'll hear next from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Just wanted to go back to the cost justified-ness of the price increases. When I look at your gross margin drivers, at least in this quarter, the 140 basis points you got from price is significantly higher than the combo of commodities and manufacturing logistics. So I'm trying to understand why now was the right time, with the accumulation of all the impacts for the past year or so of commodities impacting you. And then as you look forward, clearly you have to invest back in the business to try to close some of the price gaps. But I guess I'm trying to understand the logic of why do this in the first place if you're going to try to spend back. Is it just because you want to get a higher lift price and hope the promo kind of eventually goes away, or is there another logic behind this around innovation or something else? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Let me start off and talk about the cost base, and then maybe I can have Benno weigh in with his point of view, the longer-term view of the business. Starting with cost, keep in mind we're not looking at this for a quarter or two. We actually look at this over a longer period of time. We tend to price to the long-term average cost of where we think these markets are going. And again, as we've pointed out, logistics costs are up, wage inflation is real, healthcare costs are up, commodities are actually still up in the first half of the fiscal; they went flat in the third quarter. But we have yet to get any relief. So the pricing that we have taken, we think it's the right pricing for the business. It's certainly cost-justified. While it's early days, it's certainly we've executed the price increase as well. But I'll turn it over to Benno for his thoughts. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. So to your question, Ali, on investments, I want to make it clear that the benefit we are getting from pricing as far as our profitability is concerned is higher than the amount that we're investing back. So there's still a net benefit. We are committed to growing these categories profitably. As I said earlier, these price increases are cost-justified. And typically what happens, and this time is no exception, that we have to invest back temporarily. In the long run, I would assume, as has happened in the past, that the trade spend will subside over time and will normalize. But as we are helping consumers adjust to new price points, as we support our brand against competition temporarily, again, as was the case in the past, we will invest back for a net benefit from pricing. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So I have a hard time seeing it as \u2013 perhaps cost-justified is a heavy term, but cost-justified given that you are yourself saying that commodities are going to roll over in the short term. So maybe it's cost-justified certainly to your point on a longer term, but I worry about what's going to happen in the shorter term to you guys, particularly \u2013 and if you can help me with some color on this \u2013 particularly as we've been looking at FSIs every week now for a little while in your categories and other's and it really looks like the European companies are putting significant amount of pressure on this marketplace already based on the currency benefit. So do you feel that this is a little bit of a dangerous situation to be in relative to the Europe, relative to what the commodities are doing, or do you still feel like you would do it all over again knowing what you know now in the pricing? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: We would absolutely do it all over again. I will remind you that right now we're growing market share. We've seen the highest market share growth in four years. And the subject categories \u2013 bleach, Glad \u2013 are growing share very nicely. Bleach now we've grown share for the fifth quarter in a row. And in fact what we're also seeing is that the momentum that we have seen over the past years from private label share has become much more modest at this point. And we're today are growing in fact in dollar terms faster than private label. I would also say that, look, at the end of the day this temporarily higher spend on trade is just one component of what we are doing. I would ask that we also consider that we're investing very strongly in innovation. A lot of our trade spend today goes against fast distribution and innovation. We're seeing several innovations off to a fast start. On the distribution front, we're pleased with the progress on the cleaning innovation. Glad with Gain is off to a very strong start as is lightweight coal. The new Hidden Valley Ranch flavors with cucumber, avocado and sweet chili are doing nicely. So I would look at it in context of our stated desire to invest in accelerating growth but investing to accelerate growth profitably. And I feel like Q3 is a good example of that. And there is more to come on that front. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. And last question just around advertising spend, roughly just under 9%. Given what you just said, how should we expect that to change going forward? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't know that we've given a specific guidance on the advertising sales promotion. What we have said is that we want total investment in our brands to increase by 1 point, Ali. And we think that that continues to be a fair assumption. Within the advertising sales promotion line, what you will continue to see is that the U.S. spending is going to continue to float up, which it has. And we are spending less in International today, again consistent with our desire to grow profitably and the stated intention to spend only where profitable in the International market. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Operator : We'll hear next from John Faucher from JPMorgan. John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Thank you. I wanted to talk a little bit on Charcoal. You talked about increased retailer merchandising as a key driver in the third quarter. And I guess what do you think is driving that? Is that weather-related? And I guess what's your visibility in terms of whether that higher level of merchandising is going to be continuing over the course of the summer selling season? Thanks. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So first what's behind this is we've been on a strategy in Charcoal to encourage year-round merchandising for a while and that's certainly been very successful. We've seen particularly strong success this year. If you think about what's happened in much of the country weather-wise, there was pent-up demand and there was readiness also by retailers to invest in charcoal to get people back into the stores and encourage store traffic, and our merchandising program certainly anticipated that. We've worked with retailers to plan for such events and we've seen particularly strong pull. The good news is we're seeing quite a bit of that translate into share and category growth. So that obviously makes us feel good about the prospects going forward. We feel good about our start into Q4 on the business. I will say that Charcoal is more difficult to plan. A lot of it does depend on weather and we'll have to see it play out. But we are certainly very optimistic about how we're executing what we can control and the early success we've had this fiscal year behind merchandising programs, again, all planned and consistent with the strategy that we've had on the business for a while. John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. If I can ask a follow-up on that; that makes sense, I guess. But if you're getting incremental sort of counter-seasonal promotional activity, it seems like as you cycle into the normal promotional activity that the incremental benefit year-over-year should lessen almost by definition, right, because you're going up against a seasonal period when you're used to having more merchandising. Is that right? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: We've seen particularly strong growth on the business in Q3. Do I expect those types of growth rates to continue? I don't think so. But again, on Charcoal one can be surprised at times. It depends on a lot of factors, including weather. But again, I'm looking at what do our plans look like and what do they look like compared to year ago and I certainly feel very good about those and we need to let Q4 play out. John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. And then if I can just follow up on Ali's last question about advertising. The ad-to-sales ratio had come down over the past couple of years. There was a lot of discussion about International being the key driver of that falloff in the whole company ad-to-sales ratio going down. Is that something where you just talked about the profitable growth, I guess it seems like it was masking something that you had to go back and now you're saying you have to spend more. How can we get comfortable, I guess, that it really is the International piece that's driving that down when your stated need to increase advertising in the U.S. would indicate that the U.S. was also part of a driver of that reduction over the past couple of years, if that makes sense. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So John, let me take this. If you go back and you look at this over the last couple of years, our U.S. retail spending has been anywhere between 9% and 10%. In fact, I think it's been closer to 10% than 9%. So what you've seen us do is shift more spending into the U.S. retail business. Keep in mind the Professional Products business, which has been growing fabulously for us, we really don't have any advertising expense in there. So you have to be careful with that number. International, I think as we've talked for quite some time, we have been making cuts in advertising. Back when we were in Venezuela, we had basically turned off the advertising. We're spending very little, if any, advertising in Argentina in some of these markets that have price controls. So we've systematically gone into those markets that are margin-challenged and have some issues and we're really pulling back on the advertising. By contrast, we've been putting it in the U.S., which is why we've been quoting I think for the last few quarters what we're spending in our U.S. retail business. So we feel good about the total demand-building investment. We feel good how it's building market share for us. Certainly it's driving top-line momentum in the U.S. business and I think you can see that in the numbers. John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll move next to Chris Ferrara from Wells Fargo. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. I guess going back to the share gains in the U.S., I think if I'm right, if I caught it right, the number was 30 basis points of gain, right? And that's despite a couple of price gap issues, right? So I guess the question is how sustainable do you view that level of share? And I guess where would you put the level of share gain needed to meet your growth objectives over time in the U.S.? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So we feel good about the share gains. We feel also good about the fact that they're really broad. Other than Brita and Litter, we're growing share everywhere. It's our objective to grow share in the U.S. but it's also our objective to grow categories. One thing that I would note is that behind the increase in investment and also behind the innovation, our categories this quarter have been quite healthy. We saw 2% category growth this quarter. That's been as high as it's been in recent years. I would say in the future I would expect our share gains to continue. I would think that on Glad and bleach we might see somewhat depressed shares for three quarters to four quarters as we cycle through those price increases. But we are putting the plans in place based on stronger investments, based on strong innovation, based on competitive marketing communication that's centered around consumer value, that should make us expect to continue to see share gains. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And I guess on the buyback, on a separate note, are you done with the targeted buybacks you guys were \u2013 I think you said you were going after some of the share creep you'd had. Are you guys done with that? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think what we've consistently said is, within our outlook, we will periodically re-enter the market to soak up stock option dilution. And I think you'll see us again periodically do that with the excess cash. Beyond that, we haven't commented on specific plans. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : Lauren Lieberman from Barclays, your line is open. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Just quickly on bleach, I was curious did you talk about what you have seen more recently as demand is kind of normalizing or accelerating now that pricing has been in the market for a couple of months? Thanks. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So I mean on bleach what we're seeing is that share has been strong. I mentioned earlier we've seen five quarters of share growth on the business. Expect that to ease up, so feeling good from that vantage point. I think as far as the category is concerned, our expectations are that that will be more flat going forward. But feel good about the innovation program that we're putting in, feel good about the communication that we're putting in. One thing that we're doing is supplementing the very strong focus on Laundry with stronger communication around cleaning occasions. One thing that we found is that heavy users in particular display a lot more usage around cleaning occasions on top of laundry, so we will focus on that part of the business. So I would say bleach is steady as she goes and feel good about the prospects in the category with the one caveat that we'll cycle through the price increase and somewhat slower consumption over the next three quarters to four quarters. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then also just on Green Works, I was surprised to see Green Works Laundry called out in the release. So my recollection was that you were kind of giving Green Works, the line, another go, but I thought it was more in the Household Cleaners and not so much in Laundry. So maybe I need an update on what's been going on or not going on with the Green Works franchise. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. You're correct, Lauren. Our focus in Green Works actually is on the Cleaners side and we have three core categories : sprays, toilet bowl cleaners and wipes. And those are performing okay. Green Works laundry was a distribution loss with one specific customer. It's non-strategic. It's a one-time event but it doesn't affect our plans on the remaining Green Works business going forward. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll hear next from Erin Lash from Morningstar. Erin Lash - Morningstar Research : Thank you for taking my question. I was hoping you could talk about the acquisition environment. I think there was a lot of talk at CAGNY in terms of the fact that acquisition premiums being demanded by sellers were too high. And I just wondered if that had changed, or if there's any I guess your interest in looking to acquire to, as a use of cash. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Well, a couple of things. First of all, we certainly have plenty of dry powder to be able to do bolt-on acquisitions, as I mentioned earlier. So no concerns there. From an acquisition market, it continues to be, particularly in the U.S., a seller's market more than a buyer's market. And I think you see that when you look at the multiples some of these businesses are trading at. All of that said, we do have a pipeline of ideas we're working against. We continue to be very interested in natural personal care and opportunities in that space. The whole idea of health and wellness is interesting. We like U.S.-centric businesses because it allows us to hopefully pay for a deal on synergies with our U.S. business and then buy a growth upside. So I would say we stand ready to do acquisitions. We're continuing to work the pipeline. But I think these things take time and they're pretty difficult to predict. Nonetheless, we think we'll be successful over the next couple of years. Erin Lash - Morningstar Research : Thank you for that. And just one follow-up. You mentioned that it is a seller's market. In that light, and obviously several of your peers have been looking to kind of skew their brand portfolio, was that something that you've considered or are you happy with the brand mix as it stands? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You might recall that over the last couple of years I think we have made some adjustments in the portfolio. We exited the auto business because we didn't like the trends of things like STP. We didn't think it was right for us as a company. Of course we more recently exited Venezuela as a way of adjusting the portfolio. I think like other companies we do have small brands that are probably trapped in the portfolio. We're always looking at that to find out if we're the highest-value owner. Keep in mind, though, many of those businesses have been in the portfolio for decades. As a result, they have virtually no tax base. So sometimes it's better to manage the business for cash over the long term and use that cash to invest for growth or return it back through the dividend back to our shareholders then to sell those businesses where you may have substantial tax leakage. Nonetheless, we continue to look at the portfolio on a regular basis. Erin Lash - Morningstar Research : Thank you. That's helpful. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would like to now turn the program back to you. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Thank you. Let me sum this up. I feel very good about our third quarter and year-to-date performance. I'm pleased that our strong year-to-date results allowed us to raise our sales outlook. And I believe our strategy and focus on accelerating profitable growth are the right ones to create long-term shareholder value. So I look forward to speaking with you again on our next call in August when we will share our full-year results and provide our fiscal 2016 outlook. Thank you. Operator : That does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you all for your participation.",

Erin Lash - Morningstar Research Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc. Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Clorox Company Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, you may begin your conference. Steven Austenfeld - Vice President- Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Stephanie. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining Clorox's fourth quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, Clorox's CEO, and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com. Let me remind you that on today's call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt-to-EBITDA, and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website, as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release. Please recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Turning to our commentary, there are three key messages we'd like you to take away from today's call. First, we're very pleased with our Q4 and fiscal year 2015 performance, reflecting our efforts to accelerate growth and to do so profitably. Second, our base is as healthy as it has been in recent memory and we're investing behind our business. At the same time, there are a few factors we anticipate will somewhat moderate fiscal year 2016 growth in comparison to fiscal year 2015. And third, we believe our outlook for fiscal year 2016 presents a balanced view that appropriately accounts for current strengths, opportunities, and a few challenges. With that, I'll cover highlights of our fourth quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our fourth quarter and full year financial results as well as our financial outlook for fiscal year 2016. And finally, Benno will close with his perspective on the business followed by Q&A. In Q4, sales grew 4% driven by volume growth of 3% and the benefit of price increases, partially offset by 2 points of negative foreign currency. All major currencies were down double-digits due to the strong U.S. dollar with the Argentine peso having the greatest impact. On a currency neutral basis, fourth quarter sales grew 6%. For the fiscal year, volume grew 2% while sales climbed 3%. And on a currency neutral basis, full year sales increased 5 points, reflecting solid growth in the U.S. behind improving category growth rates and 3 percentage points of growth from innovation, as well as growth in international, excluding foreign currency headwinds, behind price increases and higher shipments. This is the fourth consecutive fiscal year we've delivered 3 points of growth from innovation. Driving improved category trends and market shares has been a top priority for us. And in Q4, our U.S. market share has increased 0.3 of a point versus the year-ago quarter, our largest market share gain in four years. Six of our eight U.S. business units increased market share versus the year-ago quarter with Laundry, Home Care, and Charcoal achieving the greatest gains. And our categories grew 2.8% during the quarter, the strongest rate in several years. With that, I'll review our fourth quarter results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q4 volume grew 7% and sales increased 9% with the sales up strongly in each business unit. Home Care, our largest domestic business unit, was supported by double-digit growth of Clorox disinfecting wipes driven by increased investment in demand building including high levels of quality merchandising support, highlighting the value of Clorox wipes versus competitors' products. By fiscal year end, Home Care had achieved 14 consecutive months of market share gains. Laundry sales increased mid-single-digits driven by our February 2015 price increase on Clorox liquid bleach. And in June, just a few months ago, we introduced Clorox bleach crystals and solid packs. These non-liquid products provide the power of Clorox bleach in a convenient form for consumers with no spilling or splashing. Overall, our bleach share for the quarter was flat with gains on Clorox Splash-Less Bleach, offset by declines on a regular incentive bleach products. Splash-Less Bleach is the fastest-growing part of the bleach category and Clorox's share in this premium segment is seven times that of combined private label offerings. Finally, strong volume and sales gains on our Professional Products business were driven by higher shipments of our base healthcare products as well as professional cleaning and food products. In our Household segment, fourth quarter volume increased 2% and sales grew 4%, driven by high-single-digit volume gains in our Bags and Wraps business. Premium trash bags continued to be a real contributor, behind innovation on our OdorShield lineup, and new Gain scented trash bags that have had strong early success. These innovations supporting consumers' desire for value-added trash bags as well as price increases taken last calendar year, helped drive higher sales and a meaningful market share gain in the quarter. Turning to Cat Litter, volume increased slightly driven by our Fresh Step brand while sales and market share declined as a result of continued competitive pressure. We've been investing more aggressively to communicate our excellent clumping and odor control benefit, and to bring innovation to market. Fresh Step Lightweight Extreme launched in August of last year continues to grow behind its promise to eliminate odor for 10 days, and a money back guarantee. Our Charcoal business, volume and sales declined slightly following very strong double-digit growth in the prior quarter. Looking into combined quarters, Q3 and Q4 delivered all-time record shipments on Charcoal and our business realized strong share gains in Q4. That said, we're now lapping another double-digit quarter from a year ago, as we anticipate shipment declines in Charcoal in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. In our Lifestyle segment, volume and sales were flat as strong mid-single-digit volume and sales gains in Burt's Bees were offset by slight volume declines in our Brita and Food businesses. Gains in Burt's Bees were driven by the renewal face care line introduced a year ago and ongoing strength in facial towelettes. Turning to International, volume was up 2% and sales were flat, reflecting the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies, sales for International grew 11%. In the quarter, International grew overall share with strong gains in bleach, surface cleaners, and cleaning utensils. Now I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our fiscal year 2015 performance and our outlook for fiscal year 2016. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Steve. And welcome, everyone. We delivered strong results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 with our domestic businesses delivering fiscal year sales growth at the upper-end of our long-term U.S. target of 2% to 3%. In addition, International delivered strong sales increases on a currency neutral basis behind higher volume and well executed price increases to mitigate inflationary pressures. Importantly, the strength of our total company results led to a record year of free cash flow reflecting solid top line growth and margin expansion in fiscal 2015. Now we'll turn to our financial results for the quarter. In our fourth quarter, sales grew 4% with volume and pricing contributing a combined impact of nearly 6 points partially offset by 2 points of unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Gross margin for the quarter increased 270 basis points to 45.6%, reflecting 160 basis points of cost savings, 110 basis points of pricing benefit, and 100 basis points from favorable commodity costs. These factors were partially offset by 80 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased 2 points to 14.2% primarily from higher performance-based incentive costs consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. This compares to an unusually low 12.2% of sales in the year-ago period when incentive costs were lower due to the company's results falling below target. As a reminder, the largest impact from the higher incentive costs is reflected in selling and administrative expenses, but it's also included in higher cost of goods sold and research and development expenses. Advertising investment for the quarter was close to 10% of sales, reflecting support for our domestic brands and categories at nearly 11% of U.S. sales, partially offset by reduced spending in economically challenged international markets. Importantly, we were pleased to see that our brand investments are paying off and strong category growth with increases in six out of eight U.S. categories. Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.44, an 11% increase versus the year-ago quarter, driven largely by strong sales growth and margin expansion. In addition, the sale of real estate assets by low income housing partnership contributed a one-time benefit of about $0.06 to diluted earnings per share. Now we'll turn to our results for the full fiscal year. Sales grew nearly 3% with volume and pricing each contributing a little more than 2 points, partially offset by more than 2 points of foreign currency declines. On a currency neutral basis, sales grew 5%. Gross margin for the fiscal year increased 90 basis points to 43.6% compared to 42.7% in fiscal year 2014, driven primarily by 140 basis points of cost savings and 110 basis points of pricing. These factors were partially offset by 110 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased 0.5 point to 14.1%, primarily from higher year-over-year incentive costs. Overall expenses were in line with our expectations for fiscal year 2015 and consistent with our long-term target of about 14% of sales. Advertising spending for the fiscal year was more than 9% of sales, with domestic spending at about 10% of U.S. sales. For the fiscal year, our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 34.2% versus 34.6% in the year-ago period. Net of all of these factors, our fiscal year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $4.57 compared with $4.39 in the year-ago period, an increase of 4%. Fiscal year 2015 free cash flow was $733 million compared with $649 in the year-ago period, an increase of 13%, and this is the highest level we've delivered in more than 10 years. As we mentioned in the press release, we've repurchased about 4 million shares of our common stock at a cost of about $434 million in fiscal year 2015, to offset stock option dilution. We also increased our dividend by 4% in the fourth quarter. At the end of fiscal year 2015, our debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.8, below our target range of 2 to 2.5. Now, I'll turn to our fiscal year 2016 outlook. As we mentioned in our press release, we anticipate sales growth in the range of flat to 1%, which takes into account several factors. First, we feel really good about the progress we're making in our U.S. business. We're also confident in the strength of our innovation program, which we anticipate delivering about 3 points of incremental sales growth. Second, we plan to increase trade promotion spending to support our brands, including managing price gaps following the two price increases on Glad trash and bleach taken in the last 18 months. And third, we anticipate fiscal year sales to be negatively impacted by several factors in international, including continued slowing of international economies and about 3 points of foreign currency declines, of which about half is anticipated from a significant devaluation of Argentina's currency. In addition, we plan to reduce our international demand-building investments in economically challenged markets, which will also impact sales growth. Turning to margin, we anticipate gross margin to be about flat for the fiscal year, as the benefit of cost savings, pricing, and somewhat lower commodity costs are expected to be offset by inflation impacting manufacturing and logistics costs. Other moderating factors include higher trade spending and foreign currency declines. As a reminder, declining foreign currencies negatively impact both our top line results and margins, particularly in markets where we pay for input costs in U.S. dollars. We do anticipate selling and administrative expenses to be slightly below 14% of sales in fiscal year 2016. We also expect EBIT margin expansion in the range of 25 basis points to 50 basis points, reflecting flat gross margins and lower selling and administrative costs. We project our fiscal year 2016 tax rate on earnings from continuing operations to be between 34% and 35%. Net of all of these factors, we anticipate our fiscal year 2016 outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.68 to $4.83. In closing, I feel really good about the strong finish to the fiscal year. Incremental investments behind our brands are paying off in category growth and market share gains across several brands. In addition, our team drove operational efficiencies, resulting in another year of strong cost savings, allowing us to expand our margins. In fiscal 2016, we expect to face continued headwinds, particularly in our International business. However, we've managed through these challenges before, and I'm confident in the plans we have in place, including leaning into our pipeline of cost savings programs. Importantly, we remain committed to using our strong cash flow to invest in driving growth and return excess cash to our stockholders. With that, I will turn it over to Benno. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Steve. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. As Steve Austenfeld noted when he opened the call, there are three key messages we have for you today. First, I feel particularly good about our Q4 and fiscal year 2015 performance, in the face of a challenging economic environment, Clorox people have really stepped up to drive results. We're accelerating growth and we're doing so profitably as evident in the strong top and bottom line results we reported today. And as Steve Robb noted, in fiscal year 2015, we generated the highest level of free cash flow in more than 10 years. Our increased demand-building investments are paying off in category growth and market share gains with Q4 market share growth the highest it has been in four years from strong contributions across most of the portfolio. And we're making good progress against our Strategy 2020 accelerators. I believe that they will continue to create value to drive profitable growth in the years to come. Two standout examples from fiscal year 2015 of how we're accelerating portfolio momentum, our e-commerce and U.S. Burt's Bees businesses where we stepped up our investments to drive strong double-digit sales gains. Second, our outlook reflects a very healthy base business, but also the reality of an increasingly difficult international environment. As you think about our fiscal year 2016 outlook, please consider the following. Our strategic choices are working for us in the marketplace and we feel very good about our U.S. business, which is fundamentally very healthy. And at the same time, in our International business, foreign exchange headwinds are strong across all major currencies with recent double-digit exchange rate declines and international economies are slowing. In response, we've made the conscious decision to reduce spending across much of our International business and accept somewhat slower growth in those markets as we focus on rebuilding our margins. Third, our outlook is balanced, reflecting our view of strengths, opportunities, and challenges. We'll continue focusing on our accelerators, which are working so well for us, including driving demand in our core business as well as trial of new products behind a strong innovation program, supported with increased U.S. advertising, sales promotions, and trade promotion spending. Our biggest challenge in near-term really is our International business as we've discussed today. Longer term, I feel very good about the prospect for this division. We have leading brands that are growing market shares and we have promising growth platforms, including Burt's Bees, which is now in a large number of countries. So when the foreign exchange headwinds subside and international economies improve, I do believe our International business will be in a solid position to benefit. And with that, let's open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Dorer. And we go first to Steve Powers with UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks everybody. I guess, Benno and Steve, you've been calling for the elevated trade spending now for a few quarters and we've been a little slow to see it and I think that help explain the gross margin strength this quarter, which is clearly a good thing, but your guidance implies that you still expect to see it eventually. Can you talk about why we maybe haven't seen it as much as you had anticipated so far and why you're not more encouraged looking ahead to 2016? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Steve, we actually have seen it. In fiscal 2015, we actually stepped up our total consumer demand-building investment and included in that was a step-up of the trade promotion spending. So, we're certainly leaning in and you've seen that in fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016, particularly in the first half, we are going to continue to lean into the trade spending really to do two things for us. First to drive trial of our new products because we know if we can get trial we generally do well with repeat on those new products. And then second is just to support retail execution. So we have been stepping up the investment, we're going to do a bit more because it's working for us and the payouts look good. But, it is flowing through the P&L. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then competitively, have you seen pretty much what you expected to see or is it's been little bit more benign than you expected? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would say competitively, Steve, we're seeing what we said we would see. We're certainly spending into our price increases in bleach and in Glad where we feel like that's justified. But, as far as competition is concerned, what we've said is \u2013 before is, that it's somewhat elevated as compared to historical levels, but I would say that it's somewhat elevated certainly not very elevated and that's playing out as we anticipated. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then a question on free cash flow, which was obviously very strong this year again, and you finished the year below your target leverage ratio. So two questions on that. First, this year, the rate of CapEx spending relative to sales was quite low versus history. Do you see that as sustainable or do you see a step-up there as you look out whether 2016 or beyond? And then, with respect to the leverage ratio itself, is there any step-up embedded in guidance there and if you were to step it up, how would you prioritize between incremental repurchases bolt-on deal perhaps in the professional space, et cetera? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. So let me start with the first question on capital expenditures. Yeah, historically, we've spent at the level of depreciation and amortization and I think that's still the right level for the company over the long-term. It has been a bit less than that over the last two years, as you pointed out, and that was a conscious decision on our part, after we had made some pretty significant investments to rebuild R&D facilities, put SAP into the Latin American business. But I think for a long-term modeling, certainly, how we think about it is CapEx should run in line with depreciation and amortization. Terms of the priorities for the use of cash, these remain unchanged. The number one goal is to accelerate top line growth profitability. And we think we've got plenty of cash to do that, but we'd like to do that organically. Second is, we're still committed to bolt-on acquisitions through our M&A efforts, it's been more challenging over the last couple of years, but we're cautiously optimistic we'll get some traction on that over the next year or two. The dividend has been very important to many of our investors and so we've been prioritizing returning cash through that dividend over the last couple of years and I think you'll see us continue to do that. And then if we've got excess cash that's pooling up, again as we've done for many years either through the dividend or share repurchases, we look to get it back. So no change to capital allocation for the company, it will continue to be disciplined and consistent with the priorities that we've outlined before. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Just to clarify, so no step-up embedded in guidance? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think what we've said for long time is again the long-term debt-to-EBITDA, we think 2 to 2.5 is in our sweet spot, not afraid to let that go down a little below the 2 to 2.5 to build a dry powder for M&A. But we're also not afraid to let it go a little bit above 2.5 for some period of time if we've got good opportunities. So I think you'll see that number moving around over time depending on the opportunities. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go now to Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good afternoon, Chris. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So I guess back when you introduced the 2020 Strategy, the number you gave on promo spending, I think, it was 100 basis points incremental. And so, I guess following up a little bit. Is 100 basis points still the number that you guys expect based on the returns you've seen? And I guess how far of the way through that are you, if you're willing to quantify that at all? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Chris, good afternoon. So, first of all, what we've said is indeed we would like to spend 1 percentage point of sales over time behind our brands. We've also said that that spending could move around, certainly move around by quarter, but also move around by bucket. So, in some cases, it could be advertising, it could be sales promotion, it could be innovation supports, it could be a trade promotional pricing, really where we see the ROI, as you know we're pretty disciplined in how we measure ROI and how we spend our dollars depending on where we get the greatest return. That is still the right number. Originally, when we started this Strategy 2020 journey, we thought that we would step into that over time, and we certainly saw an opportunity over the last fiscal year to step into it faster, which we have in the back half. So, this 1 percentage point increase is still the right target. It's working, certainly as you've seen in top line growth, as you've seen in share growth, but it's also working given that, as you know, we're interested in profitable growth, so we see it flow through in the bottom line. So we're staying committed to it and it's still the right number. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. And I guess just pushing a little bit on the commodity piece or the gross margin piece. So, you're saying flat gross margins. I guess pricing is positive, which I'm guessing is inclusive of higher expected promo spending. Commodities are positive and you're not seeing by very much. I guess cost savings if you continue to do what you've been doing, it will be pretty good. I guess how bad will manufacturing and logistics be into fiscal 2016? And I guess could you talk about that in light of the fact that, it was only an 80 basis point drag and I say only, because it's been obviously much bigger than that. So, I guess, is that a trend as a follow up question to that and will it be a little more manageable going forward? Thanks. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good question. As we said, we believe that our gross margins will be about flat, but you'll have some variability across the quarters. Couple of things. What's working for us, our cost savings programs continue to perform well. We're very pleased with the in-market execution of the price increases that we've taken, and we'll continue to look to take pricing, particularly in the international markets, which, as you know, has higher rates of inflation. I think \u2013 and commodities will likely be a tailwind certainly for the first half of the fiscal year is what we're modeling. The things that will mitigate a lot of this, to some extent, manufacturing and logistics was about 110 basis points for the full year this year and I think it's likely to continue to be a headwind for some time for us. FX is a big issue, because that puts a drag on the margins. And then finally as we indicated a few minutes ago, we are going to step-up our level of trade promotion investment behind these new products in retail execution. So, when you net all of those things together, we think gross margin will be about flat. And here is what's important to remember, we've got a good plan in place to drive EBIT margin expansion in fiscal 2016. So, we are targeting 25 bps to 50 bps of the EBIT margin expansion, and we feel like we're very much on track to deliver that for the full fiscal year. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : We go now to Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks. First just on \u2013 a little bit on the guidance, because the operating expense comps were a lot tougher in the first half than the second half with the spending and the delta in incentive comps during the second half. So as you think about the cadence of earnings as fiscal 2016 progresses, would you expect to follow a similar pattern to last year or revert to something more in line with historicals? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So you're asking me, what our first half outlook is versus our second half? So I'm going to reference back, we do provide a full year outlook, I think there's a couple of things, though, I will point out about the first half, just as a quick reminder. As you think of the sales growth in the first half, we do need to anniversary some pretty strong Charcoal growth numbers in the first quarter of year ago, so that's an important thing to keep an eye on. Second thing is, you might recall we have the Ebola and other concerns in the second quarter, so we're certainly going to have to lap those numbers and we're watching foreign currency pretty carefully. But beyond that, there's going to be puts and takes across the quarters and I think we're going to hold to the full year outlook at this point. And keep in mind, we're one month into the fiscal year so I think we need a little more time before we start providing more detailed color. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. You had mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're managing price gaps in bags and bleach, can you talk a little bit more about that? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, certainly, we've taken increases obviously on bleach and Glad, both of which have gone fairly well for us. Although I would say that, historically, particularly on the Glad business, we have spent some of the money back and that's certainly what we're doing. And historically, more than 50% of the resin savings have been spent back in the market and we're doing that, we're spending probably a bit more. So I would say, on balance, both businesses are doing well from a market share standpoint. We're pleased with the execution, but not unexpectedly we're having to spend some of that back to manage the price gaps which are pretty consistent with what we would expect. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And, Olivia, one thing I'd just add is more broadly that part of the strength that we're seeing on a top line, we certainly think is because we're very focused on delivering value to consumers, so this focus on value is playing out. And while value is more than just pricing, we're certainly always monitoring the price gap and we have good processes in place, making sure the price sensitivity is where it needs to be, and always following a price increase you want to be extra mindful of that and our remarks spoke to that. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thanks. And if I could just follow up with one more question on Burt's Bees. I mean, it's been a great growth driver for you behind innovation. Is there opportunity to expand that to even more categories, perhaps even into Household, because it seems like you've branched out in terms of licensing the brand a little bit. So just curious on how you think about the opportunity there? Thanks much. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Thanks, Olivia. On Burt's Bees, like you said, really nice success with double-digit sales growth in fiscal year 2015, which has really been strong also compared to previous years as we stepped up investments. Three growth pillars. First of all, just continued growth opportunities on the base businesses, the categories that we're already in, in the U.S., in Canada, given that we're seeing opportunities that we have, for the first time, taken advantage now in fiscal 2015 through TV advertising to just grow awareness and trial on the base, and we think that there is a lot of space in this first growth pillar. Second growth pillar, getting into new categories. Third growth pillar, in international. As for new categories, yes, there still is a lot of opportunity and one thing that we will be doing in the front half that goes exactly after this opportunity is later on in the first half launch color lipsticks. So this is our first foray into lipsticks. It's a category where there is a sizable consumer need for natural products and we have a wonderful product out there, both in terms of product performance as well as in terms of packaging, that we think is highly differentiated and we have started to engage our customers in this opportunity and are getting real enthusiastic response. So that's the next one up where we feel like we can make a significant dent in the new category. But like I said, over time, there should be additional opportunities to get into new categories beyond this. Operator : And we'll go now to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein Research. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey guys. I want to drill down a couple of things, two things. One is, so given the spending you're describing, it sounds like we should expect next year to be more of a volume-driven year than a pricing-driven year, at least net price, kind of like this quarter, is that fair? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, certainly given foreign currency headwinds, yeah, I think you're going to see volume obviously outstripping sales growth, just because of that. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: For organic I mean? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Perhaps, Ali, with the exception of international of course where volumes may be somewhat under pressure and where we'll continue to do the best we can on pricing to offset the FX and cost inflation headwinds. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So I want to bring that your gross margin guidance a little bit, because if it is going to be a little bit more volume-driven at least organically, and it reiterates some of the questions earlier. But if pricing is up, volume leverage you're going to get, commodities are a help, cost savings help, and you mentioned the offsets of that are effectively some trade spend, which is only going to be about half of commodities, you really only have FX as the last bucket. And you can make estimates and slice this either way, but it feels like you're talking about several hundred basis points of gross margin impact from FX. I don't know if that can be right. So within that FX, can you disaggregate that a little bit, give us some thoughts on why you think it's that bad. And particularly you mentioned in the release that you're believing there's going to be an Argentinean deval there, that's different than a lot of other companies we're hearing from. So a little bit more detail on that in particular, the offsets particularly around FX would be helpful. I can't get there the way you're describing it. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. Well, I'll let you do the math. But the three things that we would point out are, number one, the fact that we are going to invest more in the business, that will come through trade spending and, in the short-term, that's depressive to gross margin, over the long-term as you drive trial and repeat, it's a good thing. Manufacturing logistics cost, which does impact us probably a little bit more than other companies because we tend to run heavier loads and longer lanes, so that'll be some pressure. And then, again, foreign currency, obviously, is going to continue to be a drag including Argentina. Let me spend a minute on your question regarding Argentina because I recognize that we're probably a bit unique in terms of putting this into the outlook, but we think it's prudent to put this into the outlook, and why is that? Well, number one, inflation rates as we all know in Argentina are running well ahead of a lot of other countries. Number two, we've not seen a devaluation in that country for quite some time, most of the leading economists are actually projecting that there will be a major devaluation sometime in the next year or so. And third, and this is a very important point, one of the leading indicators of a devaluation is the difference between the parallel rate and the official government rate and that has been widening pretty consistently in Argentina for some time. So for all of those reasons, we do think a devaluation in Argentina is likely. Obviously the timing and the amount is very difficult to call, but we wanted to call that out and put that in the outlook because we thought that was important for people to understand. And we'll need to get farther into the year and see how that actually plays out. But we do think there is a real risk for this company and probably for other companies in Argentina. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: You guys have been ahead of the game on Venezuela, so I guess we'll watch this one on Argentina. One last question on the Lifestyle segment, obviously a little bit tougher this quarter, Dressings and Sauces and Brita continues for a little bit. And as both an issue on top line and margins, trying to get a better sense of whether we should expect the historical positive margin mix you were getting from that category to come back or do you believe that you're still going to feel some pressure in that category top line and also margins will be pulling back? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So I would say that when you look at that segment and you're looking at businesses like Brita and Burt's Bees and Food, they have very attractive margins, so there is no change to that. As those businesses deliver growth, that'll give us a bit of tailwind from a margin standpoint, so continue to feel good. The fact that the margin was down a bit in the fourth quarter, not concerned, we're spending a bit more behind Burt's Bees. We've got the lip color launch that Benno talked, that's going incredibly well. So it was a conscious decision in our part to invest a bit more in that business. And from a top line growth standpoint, I think we continue to feel very good about Burt's for the full year. It was double-digit grower. The Brita business has been a bit of a drag on the business, but I was very pleased to see in the fourth quarter we actually had some positive growth on Brita, and so, I think, some of the actions we're taking are starting to get traction. And again, Hidden Valley Ranch continues to perform well. But we did struggle a bit with the KC Masterpiece and that hurt us a bit in the quarter. So, on balance, feeling very good about the segment and the plans that we've got in place for those businesses. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : And we'll go now to Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey guys, good morning. Just want to clarify something you said earlier, Steve, regarding the increased promo to address price gaps in both bleach and trash bags. You've mentioned in the past that you did expect some volume impact from that. Has that been going as you expected? Or is this to address something that's gotten worse than your model had predicted? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Joe, this is Benno. Good afternoon. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, I would say, if we take those in turn, in Laundry, that's gone about as expected, the category has actually done very well. And the category has done and has been at its best since we've started lapping the compaction a few years ago. So, feeling really good about that and I would call that about in line share continues to grow. So, that's as expected. Glad, I would call that's better than expected with strong sales growth, but also strong volume growth. And I would associate that with a really strong starts behind our Glad OdorShield Febreze with Gain scented trash bags that have helped us grow not just the dollar share, but also volume share in the last quarter. And we're certainly continued to invest in that, because we have a lot of momentum in that. And in Q1, we'll double down on innovation and we will launch, for the first time, Glad with Clorox trash bags and what that is, is a new premium trash bag with an antimicrobial agent embedded in the drawstring and we think that that'll continue to extend the string of nice successes we've had behind innovation in the categories. So, Glad certainly going better than expected and we're investing behind the momentum. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got it. Okay. And then, in terms of the Cleaning segment you mentioned up 9% obviously much bigger than what we're looking for, most of that coming from wipes. Was there a merchandising activity that may have pulled forward some demand there? Or was that a real number essentially? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Joe, if you look at cleaning, the strength actually has been in all parts of the business certainly wipes has been up double-digits. And I would say that we're certainly investing in merchandising, but as we invest in merchandising it's behind innovations and it's to drive trial, because as you'll recall the household penetration in this category is still at/or about 50%, so I look at that as glass half-empty I guess and there is still an opportunity to keep driving impulse purchases and household penetration that way. But also Clorox cleanup sprays and toilet bowl cleaners and those are significant businesses, they were up double-digits in sales in the last quarter, so I feel like the Home Care strength is relatively broad-based and also fueled by a relatively strong innovation program. Bleach, we talked was up. Clorox 2 grew share significantly and that's been departure from previous trends and we're feeling good about that business. And also, our Professional business displayed really a solid growth. So, in a nutshell, I'm feeling good about the momentum across all of cleaning. We'll keep investing in profitable growth. Certainly results at this point are particularly strong and I would be cautious to say that we should expect a continuation of trends like it. But, I like where we are and I like where we're going. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got you. And just one last one if I could in terms of splash Splash-Less Bleach. I mean, obviously it's a big margin driver for you guys. How big could that be if you look at crystals and the solid packs in terms of a percentage of the overall category? Thanks. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Tough to quantify in percentages certainly, but, as you know, we are very focused in bleach not just to drive market share, but to drive quality of market share and what we mean by that is to keep shifting the business towards value-added segments. Splash-Less is the star right now. The scented bleach segment falls into that category as well. And this quarter, we will launch bleach packs and bleach crystals, a premium price innovation that gives consumers the performance of Clorox bleach in a more convenient form that's easy to dose. So, we feel like there is significant upside and the consumer is responding to those value-added innovations and we'll keep driving that. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : We go now to Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Hi. This is Faiza calling in for Bill. So, I just had a couple of questions. One, it sounds like you're moving some dollars from the A&P line to trade spending. So, one, is that fair? And two, is that because you are reducing spending in international markets or is that across the globe and is that because you're finding that the ROI is better on trade spending than on A&P? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. What we said is that we will spend an additional percentage point of sales and we've said that those dollars will move around, so you will always see shifts between quarters. Within advertising and sales promotion, if you look at advertising and sales promotion is actually up. So, we are spending incrementally in trade, but that spending is incremental to advertising and sales promotion and not replacement to advertising and sales promotion. What we are certainly doing within advertising and sales promotion is shift from international, where the returns in some countries right now are clearly lower and we're not interested in investing in not-profitable volume. And those dollars go into the U.S. where we are seeing a nice return and where you see that deliver strong growth in businesses like Burt's Bees, but also Home Care. So, trade is incremental right now to advertising sales promotion, that's probably going to be here to stay for a little while at the somewhat elevated basis, but we're also continuing to be very committed to advertising and sales promotion spend as is evident in the fiscal year results, and we like the return in that area as well. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. But it sounds like for next year to make the guidance work with the flat gross margin and S&A is slightly below 14 points, it sounds like the ratio is going to go down next year for fiscal 2016? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Faiza, again what we would really focus on is the fact that we do have a plan to get to the 25 bps to 50 bps of EBIT margin expansion. A good chunk of that is going to come from lower S&A costs in part because of the productivity efforts that we put in place in the company and in part because we expect to normalize our incentive compensation cost, so I think that'll be the biggest single contributor. As a company, as Benno indicated, we're going to invest and invest a bit more heavily in consumer demand-building investment, but the mix across the quarters can move between advertising as well as trade. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And then just wanted to ask again about wipes. So I know the sell-through data has been really good. Can you just talk a little bit more about \u2013 I know there has been a lot of innovation there also, but how sustainable, how should we think about the wipes category going forward? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So the wipes business has been a growth driver for us for a while and I'm confident that it can and will be going forward. And the way we're going to drive growth is, one, a focus on delivering superior value to the consumer, we have a consumer-preferred product and we're making clear to the consumer that they are aware of this value superiority and we're certainly investing very strongly in advertising sales promotion and also in trade promotion like I said. And then, two, innovation and one innovation that's done particularly well for us over the last six months is the wipes with the micro scrubbers for particularly tough tasks and we're certainly driving that innovation through spending that creates awareness and trial. At the end of the day, while wipes is on trend, we've talked to many of you in the past about consumers moving towards cleaning in the flow occasions that don't disrupt the flow of the day and wipes are the preferred product form to meet this consumer need, so there is a tremendous consumer tailwind. And with the market share of back at about 50%, we're really poised to capitalize on that trend. So, we see tremendous opportunities for continued growth in this segment. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And we'll go now to Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good afternoon, folks. Thank you for the question. I want to follow up on the line of questioning around gross margins first, and I apologize if you answered this, I'm trying to multi-task a little bit. But to Ali's question, we get to similar math. You tried to bridge the assumptions and there is a hole of around 200 basis points or so in your gross margin guidance. Is that really the magnitude of FX pressure you're expecting? Or is it maybe the commodity assumption, commodities clearly inflected into a tailwind this quarter. What are you assuming on a go-forward and why shouldn't we expect that tailwind to continue to build? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So \u2013 I don't know if I can bridge all the way, although I will say two points of gross margin drag associated with FX seems a bit large, so let me try to clarify on that. Second, there may be a difference in commodity assumptions again, I don't know exactly how you're modeling the math, but I can tell you that we do expect a modest commodity tailwind certainly in the first half of the fiscal year, but we are expecting energy prices to begin strengthening in the second half of our fiscal year and that we'll start to mitigate some of that tailwind. So, again, we're expecting a very modest tailwind from commodities at this point and maybe that's one of the differences. Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And that assumption on energy is that just because it seems like a prudent assumption or are you seeing anything that would lead you to believe that at least in terms of derivative products like resin, they will indeed be firming? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You know when you're dealing with things like resin, it's always a factor of obviously supply and demand, which is the biggest single determinant, and, in that respect, it's reasonably tight out there. And then of course energy prices, which good people can debate it. But I think what we have read and what we have heard is, probably next calendar year, you'll start to see those markets come into balance a little bit more. As a result, that should push back up on energy prices somewhat, so that plus a tightening supply/demand environment is a reason we believe that the markets will firm. We also saw price increase in resin, actually in May of this year, so we've even seen the early signs that the market's still firming up. To be clear, still down versus year ago, but starting to firm up a bit. Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. That's helpful. And now, a quick housekeeping question. The volume strength in Cleaning this quarter was very pronounced, certainly much more than what we would expect to see with some of the scanner data. So was this a matter of just shipments maybe tracking ahead of consumption. Is there some destock risk to be wary of as we head into next year or was there something that happened outside of scan channels? Like, I know you lost a customer over a year ago, did you get that back, or are there any other factors that we should be considering there? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would suggest, Jason, the one thing you probably can't see through scanner data is our Professional Products business because that's obviously all non-retail. So the strength in that business I think probably helps drive some of the volume strength in the quarter and you're just not able to pick that up. Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. That sounds good then. It's \u2013 you're not worried about any sort of shipments ahead of consumption or excess inventory to run-off then. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No concerns based on what we've been able to see. Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good stuff. Thanks. Thanks guys. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jason, the one area certainly, and we covered this, but I want to make sure that you guys all register that, certainly is Charcoal, where we did have a very strong Q1 of last fiscal year and where, in contrast, the weather this year, Memorial Day and beyond has been mixed, so there is a chance for lower shipments in Q1 this year, but in cleaning, it's been a clean quarter, no pun intended. Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Right on. Well, let's all hope for good weather ahead. Thanks guys. I'll pass it on. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Jason. Operator : And we go now to Erin Lash with Morningstar. Erin Lash - Morningstar Research : Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to talk about the Cat Litter category for a second. I think you said that the new product innovation that you had brought to market last August obviously continues to struggle or maybe hasn't turned the category from your perspective around as much as you had hoped. And I guess, where do you see or what is your strategic intent to, I guess, drive improving sales and market share? I know you said volumes were up slightly I think in the quarter, but how do you turn around the sales and market share? Is it more just the competitive landscape or are there factors within your control that you feel you can adjust to drive improving performance in that category? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Erin, thanks for that. So that's a business that we like, it's on trend and category growth is strong. It's a business where historically we've done very well. But, clearly, at this point, it's one of the two businesses that's not growing share. Frankly, if you look at the last four weeks to five weeks share period, it's the only business that's not growing share, so not happy where it is. And my message on the business really is unchanged compared to what we said last quarter. We're not after buying share back, we want to earn share back and what that requires is strong innovation. The competitive landscape in this category has changed, it is a very competitive category and it does require more and more frequent innovation in the category. We're feeling good about Lightweight litter which, as you noted, was launched last year, and that's growing nicely, and we're investing behind it. But it does require more significant innovation and what we've said before is that that innovation will come in the back half of this fiscal year, and that's exactly what will happen. So, I do think that it will take until the back half until we will see shares materially improve but I'm confident that that's going to happen based on what I know about this innovation, and we'll certainly let you know more once we can talk about it in one of the next quarter earnings releases. Erin Lash - Morningstar Research : Thank you. That's helpful. And then I just had one follow up on the International business. Obviously, growth has slowed around the world, and you've highlighted that. Clorox has also been very outspoken that they're only going to play in markets where they feel they have a competitive edge. And so, I guess as you look across your international landscape, do you feel that there are opportunities to maybe rationalize where you're playing or is it more just a factor of macro growth coming back and then you're positioned to benefit? Thank you. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Erin, it's the latter. We're overall happy with our portfolio in the U.S. and beyond. To International, sales grew 11% on a currency neutral basis in the last quarter. And in fact, we're gaining market share in International, so that should tell you that we have strength, we have strong brands that people like, but because of the macroeconomics that strength is not translating into top line that we can count on and bottom line. Fiscal year 2016 is going to be another tough year in international, again driven by macros, in particular of course FX as we expect three points of headwinds, but in the long run you'd have to expect that the fundamentals, the macros improve. And then, I'm confident that we're poised to benefit from that. Erin Lash - Morningstar Research : Thank you. That's very helpful. Operator : And we go now to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Just two quick things. One was the follow up on the Professional Products comments. Are those contract wins, so the increased volume in this quarter should be sustainable going forward or is it sell-in for a new relationship? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think it's broad-based. We're seeing our foodservice business has actually done quite well. The Jan/San business continues to perform well. And we're continuing to expand in the healthcare, just bringing on new items into distribution, but just picking up new contracts as well. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Lauren, one thing that is sometimes overlooked is that, in our Professional business, e-commerce actually is a significant growth driver as people buy in particular through office supplies customers. So there's nothing unusual in the Professional segments, we're seeing good strength across all segments as Steve noted. Certainly also as we've said earlier in the call, Ebola is something that we're anniversarying later this fall and that's a watch-out as we think about the Professional business for this fiscal year, certainly in the front half. But in general, what we've said is that the Professional business is a growth driver for us as a company and we feel good about the progress and the prospects. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then the second thing was just the other income in the quarter really for the year, just I know it's hard, but what do you think is a best way to think about that for next year? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Well, keep in mind, there's some one-time items that flow through fiscal 2015, things like the sale of the low-income housing partnership assets in the quarter. So to the extent that you're seeing some one-time benefits come through, we would not project those forward. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So, best to \u2013 I mean, traditionally I model that line kind of flat, but it can \u2013 that can yield some pretty significant differences because that's not the way it goes, so. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I think flat is probably not a bad estimate, again, because the items that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 where we made some changes, but also in the fourth quarter, those things are going to anniversary out. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would now turn the conference back to you. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Thank you. Let me sum this up. We're pleased to have delivered a strong fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 financial performance, reflecting our efforts to accelerate growth profitably. Our business is fundamentally healthy and our outlook presents a balanced view of our strengths and the challenges and opportunities we see in the year ahead for our business. So, thank you. Operator : This concludes our conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc. Operator : Please stand by. Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Clorox Company First Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, you may begin your conference. Steven Austenfeld - Vice President- Investor Relations : Great, thank you. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining Clorox's first quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, Clorox's CEO and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website TheCloroxCompany.com. Let me remind you that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt-to-EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures, determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website, as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release. Please recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Turning to our prepared remarks, I'll cover highlights of our first quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and our outlook for fiscal year 2016. And finally, Benno will close with his perspective and open up the call for Q&A. So turning to our top line results; as this quarter's performance highlights, the investments we're making behind innovation and strong marketing communications to drive profitable and consistent growth are working. On the top line in Q1, volume and sales were each up 3%. Despite about three percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency impact and slightly higher trade spending and supportive in-store merchandising, sales grew solidly, reflecting the benefit of about two points of pricing and slightly favorable mix. On a currency-neutral basis, sales grew 6%. All of our U.S. businesses grew sales in the quarter, as did our International business on a currency-neutral basis. In the U.S., 13-week market shares increased a half point versus the year-ago quarter to 23.8%. This is the highest quarterly gain, as well as the highest absolute market share since the conversion three years ago to the broader [MULA] reporting format. It's rewarding to see our investments in higher margin, faster growing opportunities paying off in stronger market share. More specifically, six of our eight U.S. retail business units increased market share, with particularly strong gains in Home Care and Charcoal. In addition to market share improvement, driving improved category trends remains a top priority for us. And during the quarter, our categories were up 1.8 points, slightly lower than recent quarters but still very healthy. With that, I'll review our first quarter results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q1 volume increased 5% and sales grew 6%, largely due to higher shipments of Home Care products. In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased strongly. The gain was driven by growth in all segments of our Home Care business, with Clorox-branded products performing well and particular strength in Clorox disinfecting wipes, during the back-to-school season as well as behind our new wipe products, which have been supported by advertising and strong retail merchandising execution. As noted a moment ago, Home Care was a key contributor to our strong market share growth, and has now achieved more than five quarters of market share gains. Heading into our second quarter, we are closely watching this fall's cold and flu trends, which have been relatively muted so far and recognize we'll also be lapping strong growth in the year-ago quarter in our Professional Products healthcare business, due to Ebola and Enterovirus concerns last year. That said, our Q1 results demonstrate that our Home Care business is on solid ground. Laundry business sales also increased in the quarter, driven impart by the benefit of an earlier Clorox bleach price increase. From a market share standpoint, our overall bleach share dipped slightly in the quarter after six consecutive quarters of share growth. At the same time, we were very pleased to see strong share growth on our Splash-Less Bleach products, which are a trade up from our regular product. Splash-Less Bleach is performing very well with a market share in its segment that is higher than our share in the regular bleach segment. In addition, Splash-Less Bleach is adding household penetration at the expense of private label, as we drive growth with new sizes and dedicated advertising. Consistent with our strategy, this is a great example of leaning-in on a margin-accretive product to drive profitable growth. In our Household segment, we delivered 1% volume growth and 5% sales growth. The segment's top-line results were driven by strong performance in our Bags and Wraps and our Charcoal business. In Bags and Wraps, sales were up mid-single-digits behind innovation in premium trash bags, as well as a price increase taken in late calendar year 2014. Similar to my comments on the bleach business, where we're benefiting from growth on higher-margin Splash-Less Bleach, the Glad business is driving category trade-up from our base trash bags to our higher-margin premium trash bag business, represented by our Force Flex and OdorShield offerings. Following a number of new scent offerings, new Glad OdorShield trash bags with the scent of Gain have been particularly successful, supported by advertising and strong digital marketing. Further, we look forward to sharing with you additional innovation in Glad's premium trash bag segment as part of our next quarter's discussion. In the Charcoal business, sales also grew strongly, and frankly, much stronger than anticipated, due to promotions, consumption, and outstanding retail execution behind the U.S. Labor Day holiday. In the quarter, we were lapping double-digit growth a year ago, so we were very pleased to deliver strong results on top of that. There is some risk, especially given the wet El Nino weather pattern being forecast, that consumption will slow, particularly following last year's mid-single-digit growth. But while whether may temper near-term results, our Charcoal business is clearly performing very well. Turning to Cat Litter, while our volume declined in this competitive category, Q1 sales increased behind the performance of our lightweight products. While competition in this category will remain intense over the next several quarters, we're looking forward to the launch of new Fresh Step with Febreze in calendar year 2016, which will make us stronger competitively. In our Lifestyle segment, volume increased 8% and sales grew 7%, with volume and sales improving in all three business units; Food, Burt's Bees and Brita. Our Food business performed strongly behind our Ranch with bottled salad dressings, such as Ranch with sweet chili and ranch with roasted garlic, as well as our dry Hidden Valley dressing and dip mixes such as Greek yogurt. On our Burt's Bees business, volume and sales grew double-digits, largely due to innovation in face care products, as well as the earlier timing of holiday shipments. Facial towelettes also continue to perform very strongly. Burt's Bees now holds the number four market share position in the lip crayon category, an impressive position recognizing the crayon category includes both conventional and natural offerings such as Burt's Bees. Turning to our Brita water filtration business, our strategy to drive trial of pour-through systems showed encouraging results in Q1, delivering mid-single-digit volume and sales growth behind strong execution during the back-to-school period and incremental distribution gains in ecommerce. Turning to International, volume for the quarter was flat, whereas sales declined 8%, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, essentially across all markets. On a currency-neutral basis, sales for International grew a solid 5%. Steve will discuss our financial results momentarily, but we're pleased that our Go Lean strategy in International is working, as we focus on pricing maximization, cost savings, rightsizing our infrastructure and optimizing demand creation. Strong execution of our go lean strategy in International is particularly important as we look ahead to the balance of the fiscal year, recognizing the possibility that foreign currency headwinds may worsen, which would put additional pressure on profitability in our International business. So to wrap up, although just 90 days into the fiscal year, we're pleased with our top-line performance. As we look to the balance of the fiscal year 2016, we remain committed to growing profitably through strong brand investment and clearly demonstrating through our 3D brand-building approach, the value that our products provide consumers regardless of price point. Factoring in our strong Q1 sales performance, as well as our outlook for unfavorable foreign exchange rates, as well as stepped-up competitive pressure in the second half of the year, we continue to anticipate sales to be about flat to up 1% or 3% to 4% on a currency-neutral basis. Now I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q1 performance and our outlook for fiscal year 2016. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Steve and welcome, everyone. Well, we're very pleased with the company's strong performance in the first quarter. We grew sales across all our U.S. businesses and in International on a currency-neutral basis. Importantly, we expanded our margins by driving productivity and cost savings programs across all our U.S. business segments. Now I'll turn to our financial results for the quarter. In our first quarter, sales grew 3%, with volume and pricing contributing a combined impact of nearly six points. Sales results also reflected nearly three points of unfavorable foreign exchange rates and higher trade promotion spending. Gross margin for the quarter increased 220 basis points to 45%, reflecting 140 basis points of cost savings, 110 basis points of pricing benefit and 100 basis points from favorable commodity costs. These factors were partially offset by 120 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was essentially flat versus year ago, at 13.4% of sales. Advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was closed to 9% of sales, essentially flat compared to the year-ago period. In total, demand-building investments including trade promotion spending increased $13 million, reflecting support behind product innovation, which contributed to category growth and market share gains in the quarter. Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of a $1.32, a 20% increase versus a year ago quarter, driven largely by strong sales growth and margin expansion. Free cash flow for the quarter was $107 million, or about 8% of sales compared with $205 million in the year-ago quarter or about 15% of sales. Free cash flow in the first quarter was lower, largely due to higher performance-based employee incentive compensation payments related to our strong fiscal-year 2015 results. Looking forward, we anticipate free cash flow for the fiscal year to be about 10% of the sales. In the first quarter, we repurchased about 1 million shares of our common stock at a cost of about $112 million to offset stock-option dilution. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.8 times, below our target range of 2 times to 2.5 times. Now we'll turn to our fiscal year 2016 outlook. We continue to anticipate sales growth of flat to up 1% or 3% to 4% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting strong first quarter sales growth and slower growth rates in subsequent quarters. Our sales outlook also takes into account the following factors; ongoing investment behind our innovation program, which we continue to anticipate delivering about 3 points of incremental sales growth for the full year. Continued slowing International economies with about 3 points of impact from foreign currency declines. With the ongoing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we're closely monitoring the possibility of worsening exchange rates in the balance of the fiscal year. And finally, in light of the positive momentum in our market shares, we're preparing to address potential heightened competitive activity in the second half of the fiscal year, particularly in key categories, including Bags and Wraps, Litter and Home Care. Turning to margin, previously we had assumed gross margin will be flat for the full fiscal year. However, based on our strong first quarter results, we now anticipate gross margin to increase modestly or about 25 basis points to 50 basis points. The benefit of cost savings, pricing and lower commodity costs are expected to be partially offset by inflation, impacting manufacturing and logistics costs. Other moderating factors include higher trade promotion spending and foreign currency declines. Importantly, we anticipate reinvesting a significant portion of the benefits realized from lower commodity costs to drive top line growth. We continue to anticipate selling and administrative expenses to be slightly below 14% of sales in fiscal year 2016. We also continue to anticipate EBIT margin to increase in the range of 25 basis points to 50 basis points, reflecting modest gross margin expansion, moderated by incremental investments in consumer demand building programs and increased support behind our cost savings programs to fuel profitable growth. We continue to anticipate our fiscal-year 2016 tax rate on earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of 34% to 35%. And net of all of these factors, we continue to anticipate our fiscal-year 2016 outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.68 to $4.83. Considering the strength of our first quarter results and our confidence in executing our strategy, we're cautiously optimistic about the possibility of being in the upper end of our outlook ranges for sales and earnings. However, it's still early in the year and we need more time to see how the macroeconomic and competitive challenges unfold in the remainder of the fiscal year. In closing, we feel really good about delivering a strong first quarter. As we look to the remainder of fiscal 2016, we anticipate facing a more challenging second half. Nonetheless, we remain committed to focusing on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, particularly behind product innovation and our cost savings programs will continue to be priorities. With that, I'll turn it over to Benno. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Steve. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. There are three things we hope you'll take away from today's call. First, our 2020 strategy is continuing to work and that's reflected in our Q1 results. Second, because our strategy is working, we're staying the course, investing in the business to drive profitable growth. And third, we continue to face pronounced headwinds in the balance of the year and we've reflected that in our outlook. So let me summarize my perspective on these three areas. First, our Q1 results are strong indicators our strategy is working. Some highlights include the fact that our U.S. business achieved the strongest sales growth in several years and delivered it across all segments. Further, while currency effects are real and cannot be dismissed, our International business delivered solid sales growth on a currency-neutral basis and saw positive results for our go lean strategy, with solid profit growth in U.S. dollars, as well as in local currencies. In addition, strong innovation coupled with our increased demand-building investments translated to category growth, as well as the highest quarterly market share growth and our highest absolute U.S. market share in three years. And our focus on profitable growth, supported by trade-up, cost savings and commodity tailwinds help drive meaningful margin expansion in the quarter, with margin growth in all four segments, including International. So our strategy is continuing to work and we're staying the course to drive growth that is profitable and sustainable. In International, where our business remains challenged, in great part due to foreign currencies, much like every other U.S. based company, I'm proud of the tough decisions our team has made to improve profitability across that business for our shareholders. In particular, I believe the four pillars of our go lean strategy, pricing, cost savings, rightsizing and optimizing demand spending will pay-off in the long term. I feel very good about the future of this business, recognizing the fundamental strength of our brands in many countries. Turing to the U.S., we have a robust innovation pipeline across our portfolio and will continue investing in the business and focusing on delivering strong value to consumers. Our domestic business is healthy and we intend to continue supporting it with advertising and marketing communications, sales and trade promotion spending and strong retail execution. As many of you heard at our Analyst Meeting in early October, our analysis of traditional versus digital forms of brand building show that we're keenly focused on ROIs and ensuring our demand creation dollars work hard for us. We feel good about where we are. At the same time, it's still very early in the year. As Steve Robb discussed, going forward, we'll be monitoring foreign exchange rates for the balance of the fiscal year and commodity costs, which remain volatile and tend to rise over time. All said, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance and cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the year, which is reflected in what I believe to be a balanced outlook. And with that, let's open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Dorer. We'll go first to Wendy Nickelson with Citi. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, good morning. Thank you. Could you talk a little bit more about your expectations for the back half of the year? And I appreciate that at this point you'd probably want to leave your guidance a little on the conservative side, but are you seeing anything specific from competitors either in terms of more aggressive pricing or stepped up promotion or specific new products coming to the market that make you think you're going to have to respond more aggressively? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Wendy good afternoon. Thank you for the question. We think we have a balanced outlook that certainly reflects the strength of our execution, but also as you say, what we anticipate to be a tougher competitive environment in the back half, specifically as it relates to three categories. First Home Care, where we've gained a lot of market share for five quarters now and typically what happens is that, that will yield a stronger competitive reaction to that market share growth. In Cat Litter, as is very well known by now, we have innovation coming up in the back half and we think that that's going to increase the competitive activity in the category, and then in Glad, the third category where we are expecting somewhat heightened competitive activity. Commodities have been somewhat of a tailwind and we are investing in growth, reinvesting effectively much of that commodities goodness back in the business. So we expect that the competitive activity in these three categories is going to be heightened. We reflected that in our outlook and I said we want to continue to stay in the driver seat and invest in profitable growth. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And can you talk specifically about your outlook on the advertising line? I know that was down just a hair in the first quarter, but it's obviously not hurting you. And I know you talked a lot at the Analyst Day about how digital marketing is helping you. But for the balance of the year are you still going to be in that kind of 9% range as a percentage of sales on advertising? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : What we said in the past, Wendy, which continues to be true is that there are always be fluctuations in spending by quarter, both in terms of the absolute spend as well as where the dollars are spent. I think we have noted today in our remarks that our total demand spend for the last quarter actually continued to be up. It happened this quarter that some of the increase spend was in trade, where we are getting good returns, in particular, because we're investing in trial building activities behind our innovation. And I think what we've also said, which continues to be true is that we're committed to increasing our overall demand spend by 100 basis points or 1% of sales. So that all will remain on track and certainly what continues to be true is that we remain very committed to the spend in digital, where we're getting very strong returns. Digital will be up to north of 40% of our working media spend this year, up from 30% last year. So advertising sales promotion, as well as our total demand spend will continue to be on track and will continue to rise for the balance of the fiscal year. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Terrific. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll go next to Steve Powers with UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Great, thanks. Good morning. So just, Benno, to clarify, so \u2013 or maybe Steve, the gross margin upside that you now see, are you saying that you expect most of it to flow through to advertising as the year progresses? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's correct. Essentially, as you noted, we raised our gross margin outlook to be up modestly for the full year. And our expectation is that's going to be largely offset by reinvesting some of the strong earnings we saw in the first quarter back into consumer demand building investments, primarily focused on the advertising in the second half. And we're also going to invest some of that in our cost savings initiatives where we've got some good projects underway to build a pipeline of ideas over the next few years. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's great. And then, again on the elevated spending in the back half on trade and promotion, how much of that is things that you expect to have to respond to versus things that you know, you yourselves will do in support of new innovation? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : It's the latter, Steve. As you know, part of our strategy is to continue to invest in profitable growth and profitable certainly needs to be underlined here. We're very committed to growth being profitable. So these are all investments that we're proactively taking in support of our strategy. They're not to respond to others' activities. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then, lastly, kind of stepping back, since we last spoke, Walmart has signaled a series of changes in its priorities and I'm wondering if you could help us assess how you see the situation developing, not only at Walmart but across the industry as Walmart seeks to step up its investment again in lower prices, optimize assortment and a streamlined supply chain? How does that impact your planning, whether operationally, financially or both? Thanks. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Steve, what we're seeing Walmart as well as other retailers do is invest in growth. As you look at some of the remarks from Walmart, they are investing in improving their shopper experience, that should benefit Clorox as well as other players in the industry. All of our conversations with retailers today are about growth and about investing in growth, in particular, around the innovation, and that's perhaps also why we're seeing such strong top-line growth at this point, because we have a very strong and balanced innovation portfolio across all of our brands and our retailers are recognizing us for that. So, we're staying the course with our strategy and we're seeing success as certainly as evidenced by this last quarter sales results. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Jason. Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I'm going to echo a question that was asked on the Church & Dwight call earlier today because I think it's obviously relevant for your gross margin progression. Your view of resin costs on a go-forward, as we look at the cost curve, it looks like it stayed early last year only to creep back up in the summer and then fade again. So, it looks like from where we sit today this is a benefit that should keep on giving throughout your fiscal year, albeit at likely a more muted rate than we've seen before. Is that consistent with how you see things going forward? And if not, how's it different? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, Jason, as you know, resin costs are particularly volatile, but here's what we would say. We'd certainly expect to get commodity cost tailwinds this fiscal year. And most of that will be driven by resin. And I also think it'll over index in the first half of the fiscal. If you go back to fiscal 2015, beginning in the fourth quarter, we saw commodity cost tailwinds, that continues straight to the first quarter, which came in as expected. And I would expect that to continue through Q2. As we get into the second half of the fiscal year, two things we're going to monitor very closely, number one is just energy prices, because that can have an influencing impact. Second is overseas markets because it is a supply and demand market. And then third, production capacity appears to be somewhat tight depending on who you listen to and it doesn't take much of a supply disruption to cause those markets to move up quickly. So, I think we'll get tailwinds for the year, they will be more in the first half than the second half and we'll start to lap that as we move through the fiscal year. Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Fair enough. One more and then I'll pass it on. You are not the first one to talk about moving dollars into trade and out of traditional pull-type vehicles, although I appreciate the aggregate spend is growing for you. Is it possible that we're on the cusp of more aggressive pricing action as the slush fund of money that's sitting within the trade budgets out there grows? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : So, Jason, what we said is that dollars will fluctuate and I can tell you that most of our trade dollars are going into everyday low pricing. So, I can't comment on slush funds, the way you mentioned it. What we're seeing is that trade promotion these days is particularly effective to support trial in our innovations. And that's why the dollars go there, but what we've also said is that we're seeing equally strong returns in our digital and social media spend and we expect dollars to continue to flow in those two areas. So, dollars will flow back and forth, I wouldn't read too much into what's happening in one quarter, but it's certainly true that right now our trade funds in support of our innovation are particularly effective. Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Very good. Thanks a lot and congratulations on the good start to the year. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. I want to go back to Walmart for a second because you certainly said that they want investment to grow, and of course. But if you think about Walmart-specific virtual cycle, they have a very clear piece which is lower prices to the consumer drive sales growth. So, assuming there's elasticity there is their hope. And they've committed billions of dollars of price reinvestments, not this year but starting next year. So, I'm wondering, you guys are in such a strong position with them, you have great relationships with them. But that's somewhat of a double-edged sword because you do have the ability to drive volume in their store, traffic in their store, and volume out of lower prices. I understand you're trying to push innovation but might it be more difficult going forward given their shift and their commitment around pricing and their modus operandi, which is lower prices drives traffic in their store? How have your conversations shifted? And probably not yet but do you anticipate them shifting going forward on that specific topic? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Ali, so in many ways the way I'd look at this is, Walmart has always been about very competitive prices every day and they're going perhaps back to what has worked so well for Walmart for so many years and frankly what's helped build our business with them to such a strong position. Our conversations really have not changed, what Walmart's looking for is growth that is profitable and that's exactly what we're looking for. What Walmart is looking for is innovation and they've been particularly receptive, as have many other retailers, to strong innovation and there isn't a lot of great innovation out there in the marketplace right now, as we look at various categories and as you know, we're very committed to innovation, our innovation program is pretty strong. Fundamentally, they invest in where we invest in. They invest in neighborhood markets and they invest in ecommerce. Those are areas that we're very interested in and those are areas where market-leading brands will benefit from. So, I can tell you that while I, as you'll appreciate, can't comment on specific conversations that we'll have within every day, the conversations we have with them are predominantly around growth and that's not changed over the last few years. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So, do you think the commitment to have \"billions of dollars\" of reinvestment in price more as posturing? Or \u2013 I guess I'll leave it there. Do you think there's more posturing in that sense? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : We'll have to let this play out, certainly. What I can tell you, as it relates to our categories is that our price elasticity certainly are such that, we have been rewarded and Walmart has been rewarded by trade up, by pricing, by all the activities that we have put in place over the last few years to grow, but also grow profitability. And we continue to have a very productive dialog with Walmart on what drives CAGR growth and what drives profitable growth. As you know, we advise them on their categories and most of the categories that we're in, so it's all I can say at this point. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. So if you perhaps use that as a jumping board and you look at your operating margins at 20.6%, again, background, biggest retailer took a profit warning, which are pretty much tying peak margins in Q1, at least, how sustainable should we think of those given what we just talked about, but also just given what you guys just said from a competitive perspective likely getting tougher, commodities being in this kind of good spot in terms of area under the curve as commodities are down and pricing is up? How should we think about the sustainability of the operating margin number you guys delivered this quarter going forward, stable, down, not just this year but beyond that, as well? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Ali. This is Steve. Let me try this. Over the long-term we continue to remain committed to adding about 25 bps to 50 bps of the EBIT margin expansion as we've talked for some time. And we're certainly feeling very good about a relative fast start this fiscal year to do it and feel very good about our plans to do that. I think as you look at the longer term, our belief is the combination of margin-accretive innovation, the opportunity to take targeted pricing, particularly in International markets and even rebuild our International margins through our go lean approach, as well as SG&A management, all of those things and our cost savings programs I think gives us confidence that we're going to deliver good, steady margin expansion. But you will have some variability across the quarters, and we've had a really good quarter in the first quarter. I think \u2013 I feel very good about the first half, but I think the second half margins will probably be a bit challenged, just for all the reasons that we've talked about. So, in short, feel good about the long-term plans that we have for the company, but you'll have some ups and downs over time across the quarters. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Appreciate the perspective. Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks so much. You talked about the potential for heightened promotional activity and competition by peers. Have you already started seeing some of that or is that more of an expectation that it will pick up as the year progresses? Because I'm trying to understand, if you grew 20% EPS in Q1, what's going to drive it to just basically flat for the rest of the year? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, in terms of the heightened competition, I think we've seen elevated competition for quite some time. I think as Benno and Steve had pointed out in their opening comments, historically when you build market share the way we have consistently quarter-after-quarter, the competition tends to come back a bit stronger. So we're certainly coming off of very strong first quarter results and it just seems prudent to us to take some of that strength and invest it back behind these innovation programs and consumer demand building programs that we have. And so that's really what we're signaling. We have yet to see another leg up in the competitive set, but as you know these tend to run in six-month windows, so we're being what we think is very responsible by stepping up the level of investment in anticipation of increased competition in the second half but we will have to see. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thanks. And then on the spread between volume and price, it seems to be contributing about equitably to sales right now. But would you expect that to continue to be the case as the year progresses or will you see a little bit of shift there? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think a couple of things, you're going to see us be primarily volume led, so volume will certainly drive top-line growth for the company, but in particular from our International markets, pricing will also contribute, but again a lot of that's just to try to mitigate some of the inflationary headwinds and the FX headwinds that we're seeing, so it's going to move up and down over the quarters, but it should primarily be volume with some pricing. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. And then just lastly on International, both price and volume decelerated this quarter. And volume was flat for the first time in quite a while, so can you talk about some of the drivers there? And is that sort of the run rate that you expect for the year what you did in Q1? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Again, felt pretty good about the performance of our International business in the first quarter. I think looking forward, I do think it's going to get increasingly difficult in International, particularly as we move through the second half. And the reason for that is we are continuing to see a sequential slowdown in some of the emerging markets in our business and we've talked that for some time. And foreign currency headwinds, when we went into this year, we thought foreign currency headwinds would be about three point drag on top-line sales. If you just look at the U.S. dollar spot rates today, they're a bit worse than we have thought. And so that's certainly something we're watching closely and we're expecting a significant devaluation in Argentina. So, I do think the International business is probably going to continue to face a tough situation over the next couple of quarters, which is why again, what we're trying to do is focus on innovation in that business, focus on driving cost savings, leveraging our U.S. capabilities and really take targeted pricing where we can get it. And we think over the long-term, these things will not only rebuild margins, but position ourselves for even better healthier growth out of our International business. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Right. Thanks, Steve. Operator : We'll go next to Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys, good morning. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Bill. William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Was there any big distribution expansion this quarter that drove some of that organic growth or was it mostly comp store growth? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : No significant distribution expansion. Certainly we've gained distribution behind our innovations as we said, but nothing beyond that, Bill. William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Got you. And did you guys see that Wall Street Journal article about the guy running the U.S. was walking into stores and saw six different SKUs of ranch salad dressing. Is there something to read from that? I know it's random, but it sort of stood out at me that he picked on something so small in the big scheme of things for Walmart? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : We've certainly seen that, Bill. Again, our food business, our ranch business, is very strong, as I think you've seen it's very strong with Walmart, but also very strong with other customers. It should also be noted that our SKU productivity is higher than that of the competition so that might be relevant here too, which worked particularly well. Recently is \u2013 our innovation I think again that's something that Walmart has been so responsive to is innovation in the category to grow sales and grow profitably and the flavored ranches, in particular, chili, roasted garlic, avocado, cucumber have been very successful and we've gained more than 10 share points in that important segment over the last quarter. So, we're doubling down on investment in that, as well as in the other areas of ranch, as you know, food is a growth business for us and we'll continue to invest and we feel good about where we are. William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I mean the reason I ask is because it seems like you guys are very diffusive about this heightened competitive activity. My understanding is most of the discussions on pricing and planogram stuff for next year, at least the front half of next year, has already been done. So was there anything in these conversations that made you kind of put that in the press release a couple of times and then talk about it three or four times in the earnings call? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : No I mean, look \u2013 I feel like, what we've done is point out the strengths across the portfolio in food and elsewhere. Again, we've read that and you never like to be singled out in a comment like that, but what matters the most is what we're seeing every day in our consumption results and those are strong. And we've shared with you during the Analyst Day and perhaps also a little bit today about our continued strong plans for the ranch business going forward, mostly based on innovation and strong brand-building investments, so I feel good about that business and that's all there is to it. William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, got you. And then just one quick one for Steve. So the gross debt to EBITDA is like 1.8 times. I think the net debt is more like 1.5 times. I mean are you going to revisit your target there, 2 times to 2.5 times? Is there stuff you can do to get that leverage ratio back into the comfort zone? Because it seems like also this quarter, puts and takes it was a seasonally weak cash flow quarter and you're still only at 1.8 times. So, my guess is as the year progresses, that cash flow balance is just going to get bigger \u2013 the cash balance is just going to get bigger and bigger. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. It's a good problem to have. We're throwing off a lot of cash, obviously, as a company, certainly through fiscal 2015 and felt good about our cash flow generation in the first quarter and outlook for the full year. The debt-to-EBITDA is at 1.8 times, we're quite comfortable with it being below to 2 times to 2.5 times at this point because it does give us dry powder to be able to do things in the future, including M&A activity and return cash back to shareholders. So, no plans to change the target of 2 times to 2.5 times, but as we've said before, we're not concerned if it's a bit below that. I think over the long-term, we're either going to get traction in the M&A market and again we're always working on a pipeline of ideas, or if we start to see a lot of cash building up, we'll have to take a hard look at the dividend in partnership with the board, as well as just share buybacks and look for ways to get the money back to our shareholders. Again, the key for us is to be disciplined in capital allocation. So, no change in strategy or framework and we'll continue to monitor it and in partnership with the board, take a hard look at that over time. William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, thanks. Guys, I guess, a little more clarity on the increased competition. It sounds like you guys have spent on innovation, spent on trade promotion, gaining lots of share. And now it sounds like in anticipation of a response from your competitors to your success, you're planning even higher spending. So, in other words, from a position of strength. I just want to clarify, do I have that right? Again, I think you said you haven't seen any uptick, you're just spending more in anticipation of competitors spending more? Is that right? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So, as you know, Chris, increasing our spending has been part of our 2020 strategy and I think as we can see in this quarter's results, that's working very well. So, what we feel is prudent to do here in anticipation of what we do believe to be heightened competitive activity in these three categories is to stay in the driver's seat. We do not like to respond to competition, we do not like to respond after the fact. We like to anticipate and we like to continue to invest in what's working for us already and we see an opportunity in these three categories to continue to up our investment. That's all there is to it. It is about staying in the driver's seat. It's about staying on strategy and staying true to the promise of increasing our advertising and sales promotion investment and in some cases, trade promotion investment behind what's working. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Perfect. Thank you. And just one last one on manufacturing logistics. Steve, can you just go through again, just give us an update on what's going on there, the impact of the trucking situation and the height of that, the general absolute drag you're seeing and what the prospects are for that over the next couple of quarters? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So we're continuing to see inflation in both manufacturing and logistics costs. This quarter came in at about 120 basis points, pretty consistent with what we've been seeing, which is north of about a point over time. And I would imagine that that's going to continue to be a drag on margins through this year and probably well into the future. I will say on the logistics side, while costs are elevated, they have appeared to have stabilized somewhat more recently. So we're cautiously optimistic that we may have seen the peak on this one, but keep in mind a lot of the inflationary pressures in manufacturing and logistics come from the emerging markets, where they're running double-digit rates of inflation. So, it's been a headwind. It's going to continue to be a headwind and that's why I think for us the key is going to be to really lean into the cost savings, the pricing and the other things that we can do to offset that headwind. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : We'll go next to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, good morning. We've covered a lot. I just had one quick question on something in the press release that you mentioned around the timing of customer collections impacting cash flow. Is that something specific to a retailer or something that should just kind of even itself out over the course of the year? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : In short, it will even itself out over the course of the year. It's really a reflection of the strength of the sales that we saw in the first quarter. And we have standard collection terms for all of our customers, and we saw a lot of strong shipments as we moved through the quarter and I would expect that to cash flow as we go through the second quarter. I guess what I'd have you know is that the free cash flow for the company as a percentage of sales, we think it'll be about 10% this year. And so we feel like we're off to a pretty good start to deliver another healthy year of cash flow for the investors. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would now like to turn the program back to you. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. So to sum up, we're very pleased to have delivered strong first quarter results, reflecting our efforts to accelerate growth and doing so profitably. Our business is fundamentally healthy and our outlook presents a balanced view of the challenges and opportunities we see for our business in the rest of the fiscal year. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : That concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Clorox Company Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. And I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, you may begin your conference Steven Austenfeld - Vice President- Investor Relations : Great. Thank you. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining Clorox's second quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, Clorox's CEO; and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com. Let me remind you that, on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA, and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures, determined in accordance with GAAP, can be found in today's press release, this webcast, prepared remarks, or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website, as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release. Please recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. So turning to our prepared remarks, I'll cover highlights on our second quarter business performance by segment, Steve Robb will then address our financial results and outlook for fiscal year 2016, and, finally, Benno will close with his perspective as well as open up the call for Q&A. So turning to our top line results, in the second quarter, volume grew 1% and sales were flat as the benefits of pricing and volume growth were offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and increased trade spending. On a currency-neutral basis, sales grew 3% and that was on top of 6% in the year-ago quarter. Each of our U.S. business segments grew sales in the quarter as did our International business on a currency-neutral basis. Market share in the U.S. during the quarter increased 0.1 point versus the year-ago period, up to 22.3%. We're pleased to see that our investments in higher-margin, faster-growing businesses are continuing to support stable to growing market shares in our categories. We're also pleased that International shares grew meaningfully for the six-month period ending in November, which is the latest available reporting period. Looking at our categories, five of our eight U.S. retail business units increased market share, with particularly strong gains in Home Care and Charcoal. In addition to improving market shares, driving category growth remains a top priority. And, during the quarter, our U.S. categories were up a very healthy 2 points. As this quarter's performance highlights, the investments we're making behind innovation and strong marketing communications to drive profitable growth are working. And with that, I'll review our second quarter results by segment. Starting with our Cleaning segment, second quarter volume and sales each increased 2%, largely due to higher shipments of Home Care products. Within Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased strongly, with growth seen broadly across Clorox-branded products. In particular, we saw double-digit growth on Clorox disinfecting wipes and that's despite a fairly muted cold and flu season to-date. Building on our cleaning in-the-flow growth platform, we began shipping three new Clorox ScrubSingles items in December, Heavy Duty, Decide-A-Size, and Multi-Purpose. These items build on previously-launched new products such as Clorox disinfecting wipes with Micro Scrubbers which have done particularly well in market. Sales in our Laundry business also increased in the quarter, driven in part by our most recent price increase on Clorox bleach, which was a year ago in February of 2015. From a market share standpoint, while overall bleach share dipped in the quarter, we were very pleased to see strong share growth on our Splash-Less product line. Splash-Less Bleach is a trade up from our regular product and we're driving growth with new sizes and dedicated advertising. Consistent with our strategy, this is a great example of a margin accretive product helping to drive profitable growth. Partially offsetting the increased sales in Home Care and Laundry was a decline in sales from our Professional Products business which was comparing against very strong double-digit growth in the year-ago quarter, which had been driven by last year's Ebola and Enterovirus concerns. Looking forward to the remainder of fiscal year 2016, we continue to expect our Professional Products business to grow sales strongly. Switching to the Household segment, we delivered flat volume and 1% sales growth. In Bags & Wraps, sales were flat as we lapped a price increase taken in November of 2014, and also increased trade promotion spending. Consistent with our strategy to accelerate profitable growth, the Glad business is driving category trade up from our base trash bags to our higher-margin premium trash bag business, represented by our ForceFlex and OdorShield offerings. In September, we began shipping to key retailers new kitchen trash bags branded as Glad with Clorox. These bags feature antimicrobial properties that help control the growth of bacterial odors. We expect this new item to successfully build on prior launches of Glad OdorShield bags with the Power of Febreze and we're also launching two new scents in this line in the third quarter to continue bringing news to the premium trash bag category. Turning to Charcoal, and keeping in mind that Q2 is a relatively small quarter for this business, we were pleased to see that sales grew strongly in the quarter behind consumption and distribution gains. Also at the tail end of the quarter we began shipping new products for the upcoming season, including Easy Light bag, new Charcoal offerings with hickory and applewood and a new competition briquet. Turning to Cat Litter, in the second quarter, sales declined in comparison to the year-ago quarter, which benefited from the launch of Fresh Step Lightweight Extreme Cat Litter. In December, we began shipping Fresh Step with the Power of Febreze across multiple formats and in all sizes, and the product is starting to appear on shelf and advertising starts in a few days. Turning to our Lifestyle segment, sales grew 2%, with double-digit gains in Natural Personal Care and solid gains in food partially offset by a decline in Water Filtration sales. Sales in our food business grew solidly behind our Ranch with bottled salad dressing such as Ranch with Sweet Chili and Ranch with Roasted Garlic as well as our dry Hidden Valley dressing and dip mixes, such as Greek Yogurt. Turning to our Brita Water Filtration business, sales declined following a very strong first quarter. Our focus on Brita is to drive trial, and in mid-December we announced a new demand-creation strategy centering on a partnership between Brita and Stephen Curry, the National Basketball Association's Most Valuable Player. The initial announcement was broadly covered across social media and Stephen Curry will be featured in national television ads beginning in March as well as through digital, public relations, and social media campaigns. On our Burt's Bees business sales grew double-digits, largely due to the launch of new lipsticks, blemish balm cream, also known as BB cream, and new Mint Cocoa and Caramel Apple lip balms. In addition, facial towelettes continued to perform strongly, and we enjoyed particularly strong consumption behind our holiday program this year. This quarter's results reflect the health of the Burt's Bees business as the quarter's double-digit gain comes on top of double-digit sales increases in the year-ago quarter. And lastly in International, sales declined 7% reflecting unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates essentially across all markets. However, on a currency-neutral basis, sales for International grew a solid 6%. As we look ahead to the second half of the fiscal year, and the possibility that foreign currency headwinds may worsen, we're very pleased that our Go Lean strategy in International is working, and it enabled us to maintain margins as we focus on price maximization, cost savings, right-sizing our infrastructure, and optimizing demand creation. Over time, we remain committed to improving our International margins. So to wrap up, we're very pleased with our top line performance for the first half of the fiscal year, which is on track with our expectations. And with that, I'll now turn over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our second quarter performance and updated outlook for fiscal year 2016. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well thanks, Steve, and welcome everyone. Well, we're very pleased with our second quarter performance. We grew sales in our U.S. segments and in the International segment on a currency-neutral basis. Importantly, we continued to expand our margins by driving productivity and cost savings programs across all of our businesses, delivering our highest second quarter gross margin in five years, which helped mitigate the impact of double-digit foreign currency declines in most countries. We're also pleased to raise our fiscal year EPS outlook, which I'll talk about in a moment. First, I'll turn to our financial results for the quarter. In the second quarter, sales were flat with volume and pricing contributing a combined impact of about three points, offset by nearly three points of unfavorable foreign exchange rates and nearly a point of higher trade promotion spending. Gross margin for the quarter increased 210 basis points to 44.6%, reflecting 180 basis points from favorable commodities, primarily from resin and diesel, 130 basis points of cost savings and 110 basis points of pricing benefit. These factors were partially offset by about 150 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales was essentially flat versus year-ago at about 14.2% of sales. Advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was more than 9% of sales, essentially flat compared to the year-ago quarter. Importantly, our investments in our U.S. retail business remained healthy at more than 10% of sales. In addition, we continued to increase total demand-building investments to support our brands. Now, net of all these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.14, an 18% increase versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting strong gross margin expansion. Fiscal year-to-date free cash flow was $110 million compared with $207 million in the year-ago period, reflecting higher employee incentive compensation payments from the company's strong fiscal year 2015 performance and higher tax payments. These factors were partially offset by higher earnings from continuing operations. Notably, we continue to anticipate free cash flow for the fiscal year to be about 10% of sales. Now, we'll turn to our fiscal year 2016 outlook. We continue to anticipate sales growth of flat to up 1% based on solid first half sales growth, followed by flat sales in the second half of the fiscal year, reflecting strong volume growth offset by foreign currency declines and higher trade promotion investment. Our full year sales outlook reflects stronger growth in the U.S. as we continue to lean into our strategy to invest incrementally in our domestic brands. We anticipate the strength in our U.S. businesses to be offset by lower sales in International, due to increasingly unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, including the recent significant devaluation in Argentina. On a currency-neutral basis, we continue to anticipate sales growth of 3% to 4%. Our full year sales outlook also continues to anticipate about three points of incremental sales growth from product innovation, continued slowing international economies, and about three points of negative impact from foreign currency declines and heightened competitive activity in the second half of the fiscal year from competitors stepping up in-store promotion in key categories. We now expect EBIT margin to increase in the range of 50 basis points to 75 basis points, reflecting about 100 basis points of gross margin expansion behind lower commodity costs, partially offset by continued global inflation impacting manufacturing and logistics costs. Other factors pressuring EBIT margin include inflation in international markets and weaker currencies. In addition, we anticipate incremental investments to sustain our future cost savings pipeline and consumer demand-building programs to support the long-term health of our brands. We project selling and administrative expenses to be about 14% of sales in fiscal year 2016. We continue to anticipate our tax rate for the full year on earnings from continuing operations to be between 34% and 35%. And, net of all of these factors, we now anticipate our fiscal year 2016 outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.90 versus our previous outlook of $4.68 to $4.83. In closing, we feel very good about delivering strong results in the first half of the fiscal year. Our business is healthy and we remain committed to our long-term strategy of driving profitable growth. And with that, I will turn it over to Benno. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Steve, and hello, everyone. We are very pleased with our second quarter and first half results. We're especially pleased to have delivered 18% diluted EPS growth in Q2, driven by robust margin expansion. Clearly, our strategy is continuing to work and deliver strong results for our shareholders, and we remain committed to investing in the business to drive profitable growth. And we're certainly pleased to have raised our EPS outlook for the full year. And with that, let me share my perspective on our Q2 results, the effectiveness of our strategy, and our outlook for the second half. First, we delivered solid Q2 results. Our U.S. business achieved sales growth with gains across all business segments and our International business delivered healthy sales growth on a currency-neutral basis. Strong innovation, coupled with our increased demand-building investments translated to U.S. market share and category growth. Through our last reporting period, International also realized meaningful share growth. And we achieved healthy margin expansion of more than 200 basis points to deliver our highest second quarter gross margin in more than five years. Second, our 2020 Strategy is continuing to work and we'll continue leaning in to drive growth that is profitable and sustainable. In the U.S., we launched a number of new products late in Q2 and, while it's still early, we are encouraged by the initial consumer response. We have additional promising innovation launching across our portfolio in Q3. We continue to eliminate costs that are not meaningful to consumers and reinvest the savings into the business, such as, by leveraging technology to engage with consumers and drive household penetration. We are very pleased our domestic business is healthy. In International, where the profitability of our business remains challenged due to weakening foreign currencies, our team is relentlessly focused on the four pillars of our Go Lean strategy to improve profitability. And I feel very good about the future of our International business, recognizing the fundamental strength of our brands in many countries, which is reflected in increased market shares. So we feel very good about our strong second quarter and first half results. And while we're very pleased with our strong year-to-date performance, I want to emphasize that we focus on driving sustained performance over the long term, consistent with our 2020 Strategy. And given that long-term focus, as Steve Robb noted, we're considering investing in some supply chain-related projects that will feed our future cost savings pipeline and benefit margins in future years. We're also increasing our demand-building investments in the back half of this fiscal year to keep our brands healthy and growing in the face of anticipated competitive activity in selective categories. And I'm pleased that we're able to make these investments for the long-term health of the business while also raising our earnings outlook for the current fiscal year. With that, let's open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Dorer. We'll hear first from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good afternoon, folks. Thanks for letting me ask a question. You've been talking for a while now about the risk of stepped-up competitive aggression, the need to maybe dial back or reinvest some of your prior price increases. Based on the tenor of your comments, it sounds like that may be becoming a reality now with higher trade spend this quarter, the caution about an intense \u2013 more intense competitive activity in the back half and the need to reinvest. Is that a fair statement? And can you elaborate further in terms of the shape of the reinvestment? What do you expect the A&P to look like for the year? And as you step-up trade spend, is there a risk that the price line actually reverts into negative territory for the U.S.? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Jason, this is Steve Robb. Let me lead off on this. So, first, to provide some color, just like we said at the end of the first quarter, we do anticipate stepping up the level of consumer demand-building investment pretty significantly in the second half. I think you're going to see a split of that investment, some is going to go into trade promotion spending and then I think some is going to go into advertising. To dimensionalize it, over the long-term, we talk about advertising being at this 9% to 10% of sales level. I think it's likely we'll be above 10% in the second half of the fiscal year. And a lot of this is to support our new products. One of the things we know is we've got these preferred products so if we can get trial we get repeat. So you're going to see us continue to lean in on both the innovation as well as some of our base products. And then the spend should start to ramp-up as you move through the second half of the fiscal year. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So real quick, just to clarify, the rhetoric on preparing for more intense in-store competitive activity in the second half, is that a reality you're beginning to see? Or is this just the same cautionary language that we've been hearing from you for a while? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I would say, as we said in the last quarter, we anticipated a step-up in competition because what we know is that when you build share quarter-after-quarter, typically the competition at a certain point leans back in. So, at this point, we're starting to see it in a couple of categories. Glad, where you've got lower commodity costs, people are spending back in the market. And so we think it's prudent to step-up our level of investment, in particular because we've got good things to advertise and we've got preferred brands. So we continue to anticipate it. We're seeing a little of it now. We'll have to see how the second half unfolds. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : And next we'll hear from Steve Powers with UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Great. So actually just cleaning up on that, so should we be expecting more like 150 basis points to 200 basis points of incremental demand-building in the second half between trade and A&P because it doesn't feel like we've seen that 100 basis points that you had aimed for the full year so far through the first two quarters? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, fair enough. In the first half of the fiscal, I would say most of the incremental consumer demand-building investment, which there has been some, is really been focused on trade spending and it's been a little bit less than a point. You will see a meaningful step-up in second half, both in advertising, as well as trade spending and that's actually one of the reasons why the margins in the second half, EBIT margins in particular, are expected to be down versus a year ago. Again, we think it's prudent to take some of these commodity cost tailwinds we're seeing and invest it right back into our business, as we mentioned in our opening comments. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Great. And then I guess a main question on Hidden Valley, actually if I could, and really dressings in general. I'm just curious to see if you're seeing any signs or anticipating any change in the competitive environment in that category specifically? Because I'm thinking on the one hand you've got your main, one of your main competitors who has just gone through the process of in-sourcing production, presumably with the aim of accelerating innovation. And on the other hand, you've got Heinz Kraft who's shown what they can do when they focus their trade spend muscle on a category like mustard. So how are you guys thinking about monitoring those dynamics? Or do you think I'm portraying the environment incorrectly? Thanks. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Steve, this is Benno. Look, this is a competitive category and always has been a competitive category, but we continue to be optimistic about this and we're doing well in the marketplace. Our innovations are successful. As I'm thinking about Ranch with where we have noted previously that we've gained more than 10 share points behind our expansion in this important segment. And we continue to have innovation both in the core as well as in adjacent spaces in food coming as well. So we remain focused on investing in the health of the business. We're doing well in the marketplace and I'm not expecting at this point a fundamental change to our strategy, nor to the dynamics in the category. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey guys, good morning. Hey, I'm trying to figure out your gross margin guidance for the year because it looks like it's going be flat in the back half, which doesn't make a lot of sense given you've kind of said, like, most of the front half spending was promotional and the back half is going to be advertising. So any color on that would be super helpful. And then I have a follow-up. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah sure, Bill. This is Steve Robb. Let me answer that question for you. So as you've said, gross margin in the first half is certainly up nicely. I think we're up a little over two full points which feels pretty good. We do anticipate, on a full-year basis, gross margin will be up about a point. Could be a little above that or a little below depending on how things play out. But it's likely to be flattish in the second half and the reason for that is a couple of fold. First, we're just starting to anniversary some tougher comps in gross margin. If you look at the second half of fiscal 2015, you'll see that our gross margin stepped up quite a bit, so we're certainly comping that and actually holding onto those gains feels pretty good. The second thing is we will be increasing our trade promotion spending and that's certainly going to weigh on the gross margin. And then finally, we took some pricing. We're starting to anniversary as we move through the second half some of the pricing benefits that have been flowing through gross margin in the first half of this year. And while we absolutely expect commodities will be a tailwind in the second half, it's going to be less of a tailwind than you saw in the first half, again because we're starting to comp some of the benefits we saw in the second half of fiscal 2015. So from our perspective, we think we've got very healthy gross margins. We certainly feel good about the trends. And importantly, we feel very good about the full year outlook for the EBIT margin that we've shared with you today. William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then just Argentina and Canada, which we never talk about. What are they as a percentage of sales and profits? And how localized is production? Because obviously both of those currencies have gotten a little wonky recently. So I'm just trying to figure out what the transaction impact might be. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so let's take each one separately. First, starting with Argentina. Argentina represents about 4% of our sales. Now let me be clear. That was before the devaluation that we saw in December, which you might recall, we anticipated and built into our outlook. So I think on a go-forward basis, Argentina's probably something like 3% to 4% of our sales. Not the largest part of our business. And I would say just related to the devaluation of Argentina, we anticipated it. It's unfolding about as we had expected. I do think in the second half of the fiscal year and probably for calendar 2016, Argentina will weigh on results a bit following the devaluation. But generally, I feel pretty good about the long-term direction of the country, some of the changes they're making. And importantly, because we anticipated this, we have good plans, we're executing it well and things are coming in as expected. Canada, let's, Steve, do you want to take the Canadian question? Steven Austenfeld - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah, Bill. Canada's also about 3% to 4% of our sales. Unlike Argentina, which doesn't have as much transaction exposure, there are some items that we sell in Canada that are manufactured in the U.S., so they do have some U.S. dollar exposure which will give us a little bit of a headwind on the gross margin line from a transaction exposure standpoint, but I wouldn't call it significant. William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. And sorry I promise, just one more quick one. If I look at the Nielsen data, it doesn't seem like your promotional spending is ticking up if you look at percentage of sales on deal. So what's kind of missing based on what you guys said about the roughly 100 basis points of higher promotional spending? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Again, most of the incremental investment that you're going to be seeing is going to be in the second half of the fiscal year. It has stepped up in the first half but you may not be seeing all of that in the numbers. But I do think particularly as we move to the third quarter and certainly well into the fourth quarter, you will see a step-up both in advertising as well as trade promotion investment. William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Moving on, we'll hear from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein Research. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. So if I look at your gross margin benefit that you're getting from commodities going down and pricing going up, this kind of sweet spot, right, where the commodities are going down and the pricing is still up, and you go across time, this 290 basis points for this quarter is relatively high. If we look back, it looks like there's kind of calendar year 2009 was a time where you also had some of these benefits at this much of a positive from both of those. But what happened after that, very much as you describe, is that gross margins were a little bit more challenged. And I get that. You have to put more back into trade spend. You have to invest on the commodity, Steve, as you said, back into the business. And so that I get your guidance going forward, and feels like it will be next four quarters, not just the back half of the year. But what also happened subsequent was that your top line fell quite flat. That was a very different timeframe, arguably, but really it was like a two-point drop in your top line growth as you had to spend back perhaps more than anticipated into the business from commodities. So it wasn't just a gross margin issue, it was also the top line start to slow. And I ask \u2013 I noticed that in the context of your 3% to 4% organic sales growth going forward and trying to understand how you're making sure that you're not going to see the top line slowdown dramatically as well as it has done when you've kind of exited this sweet spot of commodities and pricing. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Ali, this is Steve Robb. That's a great question, which is why we're investing for incremental profitable growth. So one of the reasons we're taking some of the commodity goodness we've been seeing in the last couple of quarters, we're putting it back into the innovation. We're putting it into our new products. We're supporting our base business, which is why, as I had mentioned in my opening comments, we feel quite good about volume growth in the second half of this fiscal year. We anticipate fairly strong volume growth. So I would say that we're playing for the long-term. We're focused on delivering not just good quarters but, more importantly, good years consistently over time. And by making these incremental investments, we think that it'll lead to better long-term performance for the company. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So \u2013 sorry, do you want to add something, or no? Steven Austenfeld - Vice President- Investor Relations : Sorry. Ali, it's Steve Austenfeld. I would just point out as well, in comparison to that time period you're referring to, our categories are much stronger and much healthier than they were a year ago. I mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks, our categories up about 2%, and that's been pretty consistent over the last several quarters to almost a year. So I think we feel much more confident not only in the strength of our brands, as Steve noted, and the investment we're making, but just in the underlying health of our categories. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And from the competitive \u2013 that's helpful \u2013 and from the competitive angle, you mentioned a couple categories, a couple of competitors who are taking their prices a little more aggressively it sounds like. Can you characterize it a little bit more? So is it the private label folks who want to drive trial and so they're starting to get more aggressive on taking the commodity benefit to the consumer? Are you hearing anything from Walmart, your biggest customer, 26%, 27% of sales? Is it the branded players? And as a subset of that, can you discuss a little bit your price gap versus your peer group, your competitors in some of these categories? And are there still places there out of whack? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Ali, this is Benno. The last one up front, price gaps are about where we want them to be, and I would not consider them to be out of whack. If you think about competition, we've previously talked about three categories in order to reemphasize that that's really where the competitive focus is. The first one is Glad trash, where through lower commodities we are seeing private label and the one branded competitor. What we're anticipating that some of that commodity goodness is being passed on through trade spend, and we are certainly planning for that. Home Care is a business where we've been very successful, and we certainly noted that in our Q2 remarks, and where we've been gaining market share over a number of periods. And we expect that category in particular in wipes, which is the hot bed where we're doing particularly well, to become more competitive from a branded competitor point of view in the back half. And then in Litter, as Steve Robb noted earlier, we have innovation coming up that we believe in, in Fresh Step with Febreze, and we're investing incrementally behind that innovation. So it really is a case by case but we think it's very prudent for us to plan for that. Our strategy calls for an acceleration of profitable growth, and the increase in spend is certainly very consistent with that. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And still in those categories. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. My first question is sort of a follow-on to that. I know one of the things you talked about back at the Analyst Day was sort of the way you have shifted your focus and expanded your focus or broadened your focus with regard to specific retail channels. So in terms of the incremental trade promotion, would you say there's a consistent level of trade promotion that you're engaged in across the retail channels? Or is the fact that you're putting particular money into grocery in some areas, boosting that level of spending as well? And sort of related to that, can you talk about Burt's Bees specifically? We got the gift box of lipsticks in the mail and they were fabulous. So they looked great. But my question was, wow, this is something that's very different than we've seen in the past from Burt's Bees. This doesn't feel like a drugstore product. How much is the retail distribution for Burt's Bees specifically changing? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Wendy, on retail channels first, so our policies are fair and equitable, right? So we do not favor any channel over the other on trade. So we want to make sure that all of our retailers have the same access to the same plans. So we should not expect any increase in trade promotion on selected businesses to favor any channel over the other. On Burt's Bees, thank you. I'm very happy you liked it. And that's very consistent with the initial consumer response that we get and certainly also the response from our customers. This has been a great quarter on Burt's Bees where we delivered double-digit growth on top of double-digit growth the year ago, and we're investing behind lipsticks but also the base business to keep it that way. Look, it's a pretty attractive price point. The lipsticks I'm referring to, $8.99. It's really a great product that has unique moisturizing benefits, and we think that compared to some of the more expensive brands out there this delivers terrific value to consumers. And like I said, the initial customer response is very positive and we'll continue to drive that, without losing focus on the base business. We have still a tremendous opportunity to drive the businesses across lip, face, body, that we're already in and we'll continue to have a balanced investment program. Certainly, I think some of you had noted that while we've seen a solid sales increase in the lifestyle segments that the profitability has not followed that sales increase and that is because we're investing incrementally in the business, which is a reflection of the optimism that we have behind Burt's Bees and the other brands in the Lifestyle segment. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): But that distribution, the double-digit growth on top of double-digit growth, is that organic or is that the result of expanded distribution? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Well, certainly if you think about it, Wendy, just from a lipstick point of view, that distribution of course is incremental. But I would still look at that as organic because we've now just entered a new segment through innovation. And, from that, we will draw value down the road. So I would look at it as organic but certainly the distribution growth on lipstick and other new innovation has contributed to the double digit growth for the quarter. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. And then just \u2013 I don't know that I heard a direct answer to Ali's questions specifically about Walmart. I think ever since Walmart came out \u2013 whatever, a year ago, and said, hey, we're going go after these companies for more trade promotional dollars and all that kind of stuff and SKU rationalization, and you guys have said historically no, nothing's changed really. Just to be crystal clear, the increases that you're putting forth now or you're planning to put forth in terms of trade promotion, it's coming from you? It's not a request on the part of the retailers asking for more from you? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : No. So the increase is proactive, and like I said earlier, will impact all retailers. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : I know you'll understand that we don't discuss specific plans by retailer. But what I can tell you is that the level of strategic alignment that we have with Walmart continues to be very strong. We are growing very nicely with Walmart. Our business is very strong and we have a strong innovation pipeline with Walmart, which leads to the fact that the vast majority of the conversations we continue to have with that customer are around how we can grow their categories and our brands with them for the benefit of their shopper. So once again, the trade spend increase is planned and will affect all retailers and is not in response to whatever might have happened or is rumored to happen with any specific retailer. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Terrific. Thank you. Operator : Moving on, we'll hear from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. I love the lipstick, too. Very moisturizing. Just want to talk a little bit about International. You guys have enormous experienced pricing in the U.S. and have had a very good read on elasticity and how things would progress both as pricing goes in and as you anniversary it. Can you talk about your confidence into the quality of your analytics internationally and where you think elasticities have kind of been as you expected or better or worse? Thanks. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, we feel equally confident in our ability to take pricing in International. And we are, in fact, taking pricing across a number of the International businesses today. So I wouldn't say, Lauren, that there's a difference between U.S. and International, and our track record to take pricing in International is very strong. Now, at this point, are we able to close the entire gap that we see from \u2013 or the entire amount of cost increases that we're seeing through inflation in International? No. But we are taking pricing pretty broadly. As you might have seen, our volume in International's been somewhat flat and our organic sales growth was 6%, and much of that difference was certainly driven by pricing. So I feel optimistic about where we are in pricing in International, and we have a pretty good read on what happens. And it's pretty much playing out in the marketplace as we expected. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Lauren. Operator : Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Hi. Good afternoon over here. Good morning over there. My question tackles this trade spending decision whether it's reactive or proactive from a longer term perspective. True, your gross margin is great this quarter, but it has been range bound for the last five years. So if categories are up 2%, which is a change in a long time, and you feel confident about the health of the categories, you feel confident about the innovation, there is a deflationary environment in commodities, it seems to me that you are kind of like leading the charge here in terms of the trade spending. Why? Shouldn't you actually heed or aim at expanding gross margins? So why is this? Thank you. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Javier, this is Steve. I'll take that question. So when we look at trade spending, first, to be really clear and this is important, this is a choice we're making as a company. It's a choice to step up the level of in-store merchandising behind things like Burt's Bees or Litter with Febreze, because we think again we've got great products and if we get trial, we get repeat. We've talked to that before. I think in some categories like Glad, what you see is when you \u2013 the commodities come down. The good news is you get a bit of a tailwind in margin, but you also tend to see a bit more money go into the market. And what we tend do is adjust our trade spending up and down to reflect that in selected categories. So what I would say is when we look over the long term, you'll see us do two things. One, if commodities start to recover, and we don't think that'll happen in the short term, but as they recover, you'll see us probably make adjustments in the trade spending in selected categories. I think we've demonstrated that we know how to manage our trade spending and commodities over time. And then second, these dollars can move around on the P&L. We may put more into advertising or R&D. The key for us is to invest for profitable growth and just stay true to the 2020 Strategy. So again, I think we feel good about the choices we're making today, but we retain the flexibility to make different choices in the future as the markets evolve. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Just a clarification, right, in theory, we all like the notion of gross margin to spend because it will give you more wiggle room in terms of how much, whether you spend in trade spending, whether you spend in advertising. So why is it that then structurally your businesses don't allow for gross margin expansion? Because it seems to me that you're saying, well, basically the second half is going to be flat even though all these positive things. And it's kind of like confusing because it at some point, it seems as if you're leading the charge as if you don't want to maintain the pricing environment that would allow to build gross margin, \u00e0 la, Colgate, say. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : The one thing \u2013 Javier, this is Benno \u2013 I would say that we should not assume that trade spending is pricing. One thing that Steve Robb noted earlier is that a lot of the spend in the back half, as was the case in the front half, went into the support for our innovations, innovation to generate trial for which we get a great return, which we know from our analytics. So trade spend isn't bad. Trade spend is spending that drives our brand equities. And I think you know that we have a very disciplined approach to how we spend. We spend where we get the greatest ROI short term and long term and we believe that trade, in particular doing times when you have strong innovation, certainly plays a role in driving our brand equities and continuing driving the strong brand health that we have today and that we expect to have in the future too. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC : But just to finish up, is this innovation gross margin accretive? Do you plan to maximize the product mix with this innovation? Because then I don't understand still why gross margin cannot build up from here. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : We have an internal criterion and that is that innovation has to be gross margin accretive to the company. And then if you think about some of the innovation that we invest in at this point, for instance Burt's Bees lipsticks, you can imagine that those are very attractive businesses where we get a great return in the long term. And if we can drive trial behind what undoubtedly is a great product, which we know from internal testing, as well as if you go for instance on any of the sites that consumers use to post reviews, the initial consumer response is very enthusiastic. This is a great investment. It is an investment for the long term and certainly not an investment to maximize the profitability on lipsticks for any given quarter. But how can we not invest in the long-term health of this business if we have promising innovation like that? So we're taking the long-term view and we're not afraid to invest behind it, even though in any given quarter, short term it might not maximize gross margins or the profitability of the business. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And, Javier. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Understood. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Just, I'm sorry. The last point I would like to make, just for the record on gross margin, in fiscal 2015, our gross margin was up 90 basis points. Call that about a point. This year, we anticipate gross margin being up about a point. And, importantly, we're investing more in our cost savings pipeline over time. So the idea that we can't expand gross margins, we've been doing that for six quarters, and we've got some very results that we've been posting. So we certainly feel good about the plans we have in place to expand EBIT margins 25 bps to 50 bps over the long-term annually. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : And we'll hear next from John Faucher with JPMorgan. John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Thank you. Ben, I want to talk a little bit about uses of cash, and we've generally seen a little bit of a slowdown in the repurchase over the past couple of quarters, which makes some sense. And you're down below the low-end of your leverage ratio, and Don used to talk a lot about sort of the tuck-in acquisition piece surrounding healthcare. Can you give us maybe your view of M&A in terms of where that could be different? And would that lead to something where you could foresee something bigger happening? Or should we still \u2013 I know you mentioned tuck-in in the slides at the Analyst Day, but are you taking sort of a more holistic view of the M&A opportunities as you look at where you stand right now? Thanks. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : So no change in strategy. Tuck-ins are still preferred and what we have said in the past, which continues to be true, John, is that natural personal care, broader healthcare, or health and wellness and food enhancers are businesses and categories that we're strongly interested in. We have certainly noted that we're looking at everything. If we think that it adds value to our shareholders and as you can imagine we look at a lot of things throughout the year as do our competitors, I presume. But what we are after is businesses that are a strong fit with our strategy, that are attractive from a growth as well as a margin perspective, and, importantly, businesses that we can get at a good value. So we will stay disciplined. We will look for the right opportunity. And we do that all through the lens of making sure that whatever we might do in the future creates value for our shareholders. So I would characterize that as staying the course. We have preferences but, look, you can never say never. We look at everything, and a lot of things throughout the course of the year through the lens of making sure that we create value. John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. And then just one sort of quick follow-up on that which is, is tuck-in defined more by \u2013 you talked about it more from, let's say, a segment standpoint or a category standpoint \u2013 is tuck-in defined more by segment or in terms of something you already have? Or is that more of a size component? How would you define that, or is it both? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : I mean, we \u2013 I would say, it's both. Look, again, we have a preference for acquisitions of a certain size, but we also want to make sure that whatever we might do is a good fit with our capabilities and close in. So it's a combination of both. John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. Operator : That will conclude our question-and-answer session for today. Mr. Dorer, I would like to turn the program back to you. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, thank you. To sum up, we're very pleased our strategy continues to work and delivered strong Q2 results. Our business is fundamentally healthy, and we're pleased to have raised our outlook, which we believe presents a balanced view of the challenges and opportunities we see for our business during the second half of the fiscal year. Thanks for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, again, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for attending.",

Now turning to our prepared remarks, I'll cover highlights of our third quarter performance by segment. I'll then turn it over to Steve Robb, who will address our financial results and our outlook look for fiscal year 2016. Benno will then share his perspective on our strategy, results and the acquisition of Renew Life, which we announced earlier today. And then after that, we'll take your questions. So starting with our top-line results, the investments we're making in our brands to drive profitable, consistent growth are clearly working. In the third quarter, volume grew 4%, reflecting gains in each of our business segments. Sales increased 2%, and that was on top of the 3% growth in the year ago quarter. Excluding foreign currency devaluation, so in other words, on a currency-neutral basis, total company sales were up 5%, primarily due to strong volume growth and price increases. These factors were partially offset by continuing unfavorable foreign exchange rates, which impacted Clorox in Latin America, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. In particular, following the currency devaluation in December in Argentina, the country that represents one of our larger exposures outside of the United States, the Argentine peso is down roughly 40%, resulting in a material foreign exchange headwind through calendar year 2016, and with risk of further devaluation in the future. Looking just at the U.S., sales grew 4% reflecting growth in all three U.S. segments. From a market share standpoint, our U.S. 13-week share increased 0.2 of a point versus the year ago quarter, ending the quarter at 23%. Our investments in higher margin, faster-growing businesses are continuing to drive improvement as this was the fifth consecutive quarterly increase in market share. Four of our eight U.S. retail business units increased market share with all-time record shares in Home Care and strong gains in Charcoal. Our primary opportunities for further improving market share remain in Cat Litter and Water Filtration, and I'm pleased that we have innovation in both supported by significant marketing support. In addition to improving market shares, driving category growth remains a top priority. And during the quarter, our U.S. categories were up a very healthy 2.5 points, representing our fifth consecutive quarter of U.S. category growth of greater than two points. For perspective, during the recession several years ago, our categories were only growing between 0% and 1%. Turning to International, our market shares were up 0.4 of a point for the eight-month period ending in January. International share growth was particularly strong in Bleach. In recognizing the uncertainty today in many international markets, it is great to see that our choiceful investments and profitable opportunities in select international markets are paying off in higher market shares. So with that, I'll review our third quarter results by segment. Starting with our Cleaning segment, third quarter volume in sales each increased a strong 5%, largely due to higher shipments of Home Care products as well as our Professional Products business. In Home Care, which was our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased strongly with growth seen across most Clorox-branded products. In particular, the relatively mild cold and flu season \u2013 despite the relatively mild cold and flu season, we delivered strong double-digit growth on Clorox Disinfecting Wipes as well as all-time record shipments of Clorox Clean-Up bleach-based spray cleaner. And additionally, our Clorox Disinfecting Wipes with Micro Scrubbers innovation continues to grow share, and while it's still early, we are pleased with the initial performance of several recently launched ScrubSingles items. These are all great examples that show investments in our cleaning in-the-flow growth platform, which emphasizes quick and convenient cleaning are paying off. In addition, effective in late March, we regained Disinfecting Wipes distribution at Costco, a major club customer and a long time retail partner of Clorox. Although consumption in the club channel is not fully reflected in traditional external market share reports, this distribution at Costco will be in addition to the greater than 50% market share we have in track channels today within the Disinfecting Wipes segment. This additional distribution will add meaningfully to volume over the next year, but also modestly impact margins recognizing the club consumers typically buying a larger size item with a lower margin profile for manufacturers like Clorox. That said, consumers in the club channel tend to be very loyal to the brands they buy. So we're very excited to be able to meet the needs of club channel consumers for disinfecting and cleaning solutions through this expanded distribution. Turning to Laundry, sales decreased slightly in the quarter due to its continued softness in the color-safe bleach category and lower shipments of regular Clorox bleach related to our price increase taken in February of 2015. Importantly, however, our focus on Clorox Splash-Less Bleach continues to drive sales and share growth on this higher margin business. And finally, within the Cleaning segment, our Professional Products business delivered strong double-digit sales growth. We feel very good about the strength of this business and continue to believe this will be one of the faster-growing businesses in our portfolio going forward. Turning to the Household segment, we delivered 3% volume and 4% sales growth, driven by strong gains in our Charcoal business. Charcoal strength was aided by very favorable weather ahead of the main grilling season, as well as favorable product and channel mix, as well as distribution of new items, including an Easy Wipe bag, new Charcoal items with hickory and Applewood and a new competition briquette. Early season merchandising got off to a strong start at key retailers as evidenced by higher consumption and meaningful share growth. And while we may see a slowdown in the fourth quarter given the very strong results in Q3, our Charcoal business is fundamentally sound and on track to have a strong fiscal year, as evidenced by 7% volume growth fiscal year-to-date behind strong fundamental execution with customers and compelling demand-building campaigns. Turning to Bags & Wraps, sales were flat although this masks the success we continue to have in driving our strategy to accelerate profitable growth, mainly driving category trade-up from base trash bags to higher margin ForceFlex and OdorShield offerings. As evidence, our premium trash bag segment was up high single digits in the third quarter supported in part by our new Glad with Clorox kitchen trash bags featuring the antimicrobial properties that help control the growth of bacterial odors as well as the recent launch of two new scents of Glad OdorShield bags with the Power of Febreze. It's also worth noting that our food storage segment made up of food storage bags, wraps and containers had its second consecutive quarter of solid volume growth and is up 3% in shipments fiscal year-to-date. So, all said, we expect the Glad business to have a strong finish to fiscal year 2016. And in Cat Litter, third quarter sales decreased, primarily due to the timing of promotional spending behind the launch of Fresh Step with Febreze. While it's still very early, we are pleased with the initial response to this launch and plan to continue investing in demand-building activities to drive profitable growth in this highly competitive category. Looking at our Lifestyle segment, volume grew 4% and sales grew 5%, reflecting sales growth in all three businesses, Natural Personal Care, Water Filtration, and Food. Starting with our Burt's Bees business, it delivered another quarter of double-digit volume growth behind continued strength in facial towelettes, momentum behind recent innovations including new lipsticks, blemish balm cream, also known as BB cream, as well as refresh on our tinted lip balms. Burt's Bees Q3 market shares were up in every major segment, reflecting the broad-based health of the business. Turning to our Brita Water Filtration business, sales grew strongly, driven by double-digit volume growth, particularly in untracked channels such as e-commerce. We're continuing to focus on driving trial and distribution behind new pitchers and better filter value. Our demand creation strategy centering on a partnership between Brita and Stephen Curry, the National Basketball Association's Most Valuable Player, kicked off in March with national television ads as well as through digital, PR and social media campaigns. And while it's still early, we feel very good about this partnership. In our Food business, while volume decreased slightly we did see our third consecutive quarter of sales growth, supported by the expansion of our Ranch With bottled salad dressings. In addition, our focus on innovation in our base Ranch flavor drove meaningful share growth on Hidden Valley dressings and dips. Volume on our dry business was up in Q3, driven by the February launch of Greek Yogurt dressing and dips. And lastly, our acquisition several years ago of the Soy Vay Asian sauces and marinade continues to pay off, as we saw significantly higher volume in Q3 with even higher expectations for Q4. So overall we feel very good about the direction of our Food business. Turning to our last operating segment, International sales dropped 9% due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates, with all major markets being impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar and particular impact being seen in Argentina, one of Clorox's bigger International markets. As noted a moment ago, following the Argentina currency devaluation in December, the Argentine peso is down roughly 40% and remains at risk of further devaluation going forward. Putting that aside, on a currency neutral basis, sales for International grew 9%. Although foreign currency headwinds remain a challenge for us and for other multinationals, we are pleased that our Go Lean strategy focused on driving margin improvement in International is working and has enabled us to keep margins stable as we focus on driving value in four areas, specifically, pricing, cost savings, right-sizing our infrastructure and optimizing demand creation. We have also segmented our International portfolio into fuel and growth businesses as we've done in the U.S. and are investing selectively in high-growth opportunity areas. For example, we are stepping up investment in Burt's Bees in markets like Canada, Australia, the UK, Chile and Mexico. And we're also investing in Laundry initiatives in Latin America and the Middle East. For example, our Clorox clothes color-safe laundry additive innovation is off to a strong start in several international markets. Looking forward, we remain committed to our International business and look forward to improving International margins over time. So to wrap up, we're very pleased with our top-line performance in Q3 and fiscal year to-date, which reflects the significant investment we've made in our brands. Looking ahead, in addition to incremental trade promotion spending in the second half of fiscal year 2016 to support new products, we also anticipate increasing our advertising investment to about 12% of sales in the fourth quarter to keep our brands healthy and growing. You can look at this investment in two main buckets. The first bucket is supporting innovation, including the product launches we referenced today, namely new offerings of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, Premium Glad trash bags as we build on the OdorShield line, Fresh Step Cat Litter with Febreze, several Kingsford Charcoal items, new flavors of Ranch With bottled salad dressings and a number of recent Burt's Bees launches both in the U.S. and in international markets. So that support is all innovation-focused. The second bucket of greater investment is protecting our brands from competitive pressures in key categories. For example, we're investing savings from decreased resin cost to defend Glad at the shelf. In Home Care, we're increasing promotions in-store to defend against competitive activity. And we plan to continue investing in demand-building activities behind Fresh Step with Febreze to drive profitable growth in the highly competitive Cat Litter category. Looking ahead, as noted in this morning's press release, we've raised our sales growth outlook for fiscal year 2016 reflecting our strong results to-date as well as a solid finish anticipated in Q4. So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to discuss our Q3 financial performance as well as our updated outlook for fiscal year 2016. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, thanks, Steve. And welcome, everyone. Well, we're certainly pleased with our strong results to-date, including our third quarter performance, which enabled us to raise our fiscal year 2016 outlook. Our updated outlook also includes the announced acquisition of the Renew Life business. I'll address the details behind our full-year outlook in just a minute. First I'll turn to our financial results for the quarter. In our third quarter, sales grew 2%, with volume and pricing contributing a combined impact of nearly 6 points, partially offset by more than 3 points of unfavorable foreign currency and a little more than 0.5 point of higher trade promotion investment. Gross margin for the quarter increased 210 basis points to 45.3%, reflecting 180 basis points from favorable commodities, primarily from resin and diesel, 120 basis points of cost savings and 100 basis points of pricing benefit. These factors were partially offset by about 150 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs primarily driven by higher inflation in international markets. Selling and administrative expense decreased to 14.3% of sales compared with 14.7% of sales in the year-ago quarter. Selling and administrative expenses were also slightly lower on an absolute dollar basis. Our advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was up $22 million, with total spend more than 10% of sales, and it reflects continued strong support for our U.S. business and incremental investments in select higher margin international businesses, including Burt's Bees. Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.21, a 12% increase versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting strong gross margin expansion and higher sales. Our fiscal year-to-date free cash flow was $323 million compared with $398 million in the year ago period, reflecting higher employee incentive compensation payments made this fiscal year related to the company's strong fiscal year 2015 performance as well as higher tax payments. These factors were partially offset by higher earnings from continuing operations. We now anticipate our full-year free cash flow to be in the range of 10% to 11% of sales. We ended the quarter with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.8, below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5. However, with the recently announced acquisition of Renew Life, we anticipate being at the lower end of our target range by the end of the fiscal year. Now we'll turn to our updated fiscal year 2016 outlook. As Steve mentioned, we raised our fiscal year sales outlook to 1% to 2% growth based on our sales results to date, and we feel good about landing in the mid to upper end of our range. We continue to anticipate fiscal year 2016 sales to benefit from 3 points of product innovation, moderated by continued slowing international economies and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. On a currency neutral basis, we now anticipate sales growth of 4% to 5%. We now anticipate EBIT margin expansion of about 50 basis points compared to our previous outlook of 50 basis points to 75 basis points. The lower estimate for EBIT margin reflects nearly 25 basis points of impact from the onetime transaction costs and other related acquisition expenses including the effective inventory step-up charges and intangible asset amortization. All other assumptions for EBIT margin remain generally the same, including greater gross margin expansion behind lower commodity costs, partially offset by continued global inflation impacting both manufacturing and logistics costs. Other factors pressuring EBIT margin continue to include inflation in international markets and weaker foreign currencies, as well as consumer demand building programs to support the long-term health of our brands. We continue to anticipate selling and administrative expenses to be about 14% of sales in fiscal year 2016, and we continue to anticipate our fiscal year 2016 tax rate on earnings from continuing operations to be between 34% and 35%. For added context, I'd like to address what we will anticipate for the fourth quarter. First, as we discussed in our last earnings call, we began stepping up our level of advertising investment in the third quarter. We expect this to continue through the fourth quarter and we anticipate advertising spending to be about 12% of sales to support recent innovation including our Burt's Bees lip color products and Fresh Step with Febreze Cat Litter. For the full fiscal year, advertising spending is expected to be about 10% of sales, an increase of about one point of sales versus year ago. Now, while this will reduce margins and earnings in the near term, we believe these are the right strategic investments to drive the long-term growth of our core business. With respect to the acquisition, we anticipate about a point of sales benefit from Renew Life in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we don't expect the business to contribute meaningfully to company sales until fiscal year 2017, given the acquisition was closed late in fiscal 2016. Net of all of these factors, we raised our fiscal year 2016 outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.85 to $4.95, which includes dilution of about $0.03 to $0.05 from the acquisition. This compares with our previous EPS outlook of $4.75 to $4.90. I'd also like to provide additional perspective on the Renew Life acquisition, a business rooted in the fast-growing digestive health category and complementary to our global portfolio. This U.S. centric bolt-on acquisition is consistent with our strategy to acquire leading brands in fast-growing mid-sized health and wellness categories. Over the last several years, Renew Life has enjoyed high single-digit sales increases and gross margins that are generally in line with our company averages. Importantly, we believe the business was acquired for a good price, $290 million or about 2.5 times sales. And while this business is anticipated to be dilutive to earnings per share over the next year or so as we invest heavily in demand creation programs and integrate the business into Clorox, we anticipate the business to be EPS neutral to accretive in fiscal year 2018. As we look ahead to fiscal year 2017, we'll be keenly focused on the following things. First, we continue to face a tough business environment in international markets. We anticipate ongoing foreign currency headwinds will negatively impact fiscal year 2017 sales by about two points. Second, we plan to continue investing heavily in advertising, consistent with our full-year 2016 spending levels to drive awareness and trial of our new products. Our increased investments will help sustain the momentum of our core business in the face of ongoing competitive activity and consumers who remain cautious in their spending. Third, integrating Renew Life into Clorox is a priority, and we'll place strong emphasis on investing in demand creation and expanding distribution to drive the growth of the business and its categories. In fiscal year 2017, we anticipate Renew Life will contribute nearly two percentage points to company sales and expect our investments to integrate and fuel the growth of the business will reduce earnings per share by about $0.05 to $0.07. In closing, we're very pleased with our third quarter performance and the ability to continue investing strongly in our core business while acquiring a leading brand in Renew Life. We remain committed to our long-term strategy of driving profitable growth, including making strategic investments to fuel our innovation programs and our cost savings pipeline. Now, I'll turn it over to Benno. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Steve, and hello to everyone on the call. I'd like for you to take three things away from today's call and press releases. First, our 2020 Strategy continues to deliver strong shareholder returns. Second, consistent with the 2020 Strategy, we've been making significant investments in our brand behind the strategy accelerators, and these investments are working. Third, we remain focused on accelerating consistent, profitable growth by positioning our portfolio behind tailwinds as reflected in the acquisition of Renew Life into our family of brands. I'd like to share a little perspective on each of these three areas. The first takeaway, our Strategy 2020 continues to deliver strong shareholder returns. This is certainly evident in our strong Q3 top-line growth, reflected by growing market shares and household penetration on key brands in the U.S. On a currency neutral basis, we're seeing growth in international as well. We have strong gross margin expansion, supporting incremental investments in our brands. And we delivered strong earnings per share growth. These results, the health of our businesses, and our overall strong fundamental execution have enabled us to raise our fiscal year sales and earnings outlook. The second take-away \u2013 consistent with a 2020 Strategy, we've been making significant investments in our brands behind the strategy accelerators, and these investments are working. As discussed earlier in the call, in addition to incremental trade promotion spending in the second half of the fiscal year to support new products, we anticipate increasing our advertising investment to about 12% of sales in the fourth quarter to keep our brands healthy and growing. Now, you might ask yourself why the increased investment and why now? Well, we have strong momentum on our brands as evidenced by our recent result, and seek to continue that momentum by investing behind our strategic priorities, in particular, the strong innovation currently in market. But we're also continuing to support the health of the base business by investing in awareness and trial, and we do like the long-term returns on these investments based on extensive analytics we do across all of our brand investment. So in a nutshell, we're taking the long-term view to invest in driving sustained profitable growth in an environment where such growth is hard to come by. And the third takeaway \u2013 we remain focused on accelerating consistent, profitable growth by positioning our portfolio behind tailwinds such as digestive health as reflected by the acquisition of Renew Life into our family of brands. We are very excited about the opportunity Renew Life brings to the Clorox portfolio as a leader in health and wellness with an emphasis on digestive health. Through this acquisition, we are expanding into a fast-growing market that aligns with our strategy to accelerate growth through bolt-on acquisitions of brands in mid-size categories that are number one, or strong number two in market share, economically attractive, and leverage our core competency. Renew Life is the number one brand of probiotics in the natural channel with a steadily growing share in the food, drug and mass channel. And probiotics products represent about two-thirds of Renew Life sales. Digestive health is a growing consumer need and still a highly fragmented category, which provides for an attractive competitive set. The digestive health market in the U.S. represents annual sales of more than $10 billion and is growing at about 7% annually. The probiotics subcategory is about $1.3 billion annually in the U.S. and is expected to grow at 15% per year. This acquisition enables us to expand our health and wellness platform even further. We believe that we have an opportunity to make a difference to the business through our strong 3D brand building capabilities. We also believe that Renew Life has scalability and distribution expansion potential in existing and new channels. So we look forward to building on the strong foundation the Renew Life team has built and bringing the benefits of digestive health products to more consumers while maintaining a keen focus on the health of our core business. And with that, let's open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Dorer. And our first question comes from Steve Powers with UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Hey, guys. So some of this you touched upon in the latter part of your prepared remarks, but just that step-up to 12% in ad spending in Q4, was that always the plan? Or you decided to do that based on the year-to-date strength? And if it's the latter, just talk about how your \u2013 what your assurances are that you'll get a good ROI on that investment. And do you wish at all that you'd spent more earlier to kind of even out those investments in the marketplace? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Steve, this is Steve Robb. Short answer is, yes, this has always been a part of the plan. You might recall in the third quarter earnings call we talked about significantly stepping up our consumer demand building investment programs, particularly advertising. You saw that in the third quarter where we invested incrementally about $22 million in advertising and we're going to step it up again. Part of the timing this year for the advertising investments, it's a reflection of the new product program. If you're going to step up your level of advertising, you want to have something to talk about and Fresh Step with Febreze, the Burt's Bees lip color launch, these are the things that we're really leaning in heavy to. So the spending increase is back-loaded this year, but it's back-loaded consistent with the programs. And then finally, from a return on investment, we do a lot of extensive measuring and tracking and scorecarding of all of the investments we make and to-date we've seen very good returns. We're going to continue to lean in and, as always, we'll adjust as appropriate as we get new information. But at this point, we feel like it's a very good ROI. But keep in mind, the investments we make in the fourth quarter, most of the benefit will I think be in future years as you get awareness and trial on those new products. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. And I know some of it is going to be targeted at the Cat Litter business. And a little bit more perspective there because the consumer takeaway data still looks soft, at least in the tracked channels. I think it was down 5% in April, your business was, and down just over 1 point in the last 12 weeks despite the marketing and the R&D efforts to-date. So I know you said you were pleased. Just any update there? And what's realistic to expect from that business as we progress forward into your fourth quarter and beyond? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Steve, we remain pleased with this. We've always said that it's going to take time for us to turn the share around. It's actually great to see that if you look at the last four weeks to five weeks in the quarter, share had stopped eroding and it started to be flat. So we feel good about that and we're investing behind it. The customer takeaway is strong, early consumer acceptance is strong. And we're investing behind this, certainly knowing that competition aren't pushovers in this category. But we know from consumer data that we have a better product on hand and we're investing in awareness and trial and we continue to be optimistic that this innovation is going to make a difference to the business. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Great. And then just one last one, if I could, which is around the Renew Life acquisition. Should we think about that as accretive to fiscal 2018 versus the current base case? Or is that too ambitious, given the investment plans that you talked through? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think what I had said in my opening remarks is it's early days and so we need to get farther into it. We've owned this business for about a day now. But based on our internal projections, we anticipate it will be neutral to accretive in fiscal 2018. And, again, part of the reason that you're not seeing more accretion earlier, this is a business that's been growing high-single digits, again, it's got attractive margins. Just like we did with Burt's Bees many years ago, we want to fuel that growth, so we are going to be stepping up the level of consumer demand building investments over the next couple years, particularly as we expand the distribution across the U.S. So that's the number one reason I think as you get into fiscal 2018 we're being a bit cautious on the EPS accretion. But certainly it's a profitable business with good cash flows and we feel very good about it. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We'll now take a question from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Hey, what happened with gross margin relative to your guidance? Because I think you were saying like 100 basis points for the full year and then it was up like a couple hundred basis points for the first half. It seemed like you were thinking gross margin was going to be flat, and then it came up like another 200 basis points this quarter. So were you guys just being conservative? Or did something sort of change for the better in the quarter? And then maybe just what do you think the gross margin is going to be up for the full year now? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Bill, I couldn't hear the second part of the question. Let me try the first part and then if you have a follow-up question, we're happy to answer it. Gross margin certainly came in better than we had anticipated in the third quarter. Two drivers I would call out. The first is just stronger top-line growth for the company. As you know, you get a bit of scale advantage when you have stronger growth. And we also had some positive mix. We had real strength in some of our businesses, like Brita, which is higher margin, our Burt's Bees business which is higher margin. So that certainly helped. I would also say commodity costs came in a bit better than we had expected. Now, I'm going to caution on that as well, because I do think commodity costs are starting to reach a bottom at this point. I think we found the floor. And we're watching it pretty carefully because I think as you go into the fourth quarter and as we look at our gross margin, we think gross margins are likely to be flattish in the fourth quarter. And the reason for that is we're starting to lap some of the commodity goodness we saw in the year-ago period and we're also investing more in consumer demand spend that we talked about earlier. So I feel great about the margin expansion for the company, feel good about delivering about 50 bps of EBIT margin expansion for the year, but I do think, looking forward, gross margin growth is going to start to slow down as the commodity tailwinds dissipate. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And then just on this Renew Life acquisition, are you funding it with cash on hand or are you going to (37:29)? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, that's a good question. Short term, you'll see us use a mix of cash and commercial paper. I think longer term, we'll have to take a look at our capital structure and upcoming debt maturities and then we'll make a determination on the best way to fund it. I think it's safe to say over the very long term, at some point we'll probably go out with additional debt, but that's a decision we'll take in the future based on the facts and circumstances that we have. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Because the reason I ask is that assuming it will cost you maybe a couple percent at most in terms of (38:00). It seems like based on your dilution guidance that the thing is going to lose quite a bit of money, like $8 million to $10 million next year. Is that directionally what you guys are thinking? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Bill, the $0.05 to $0.07 of EPS dilution for fiscal 2017, it's really being driven by the cost to integrate the business, which is important to us because, remember, if we can integrate this quickly, we can get revenue synergies. We can get it on the same trucks. We can assist in accelerating the top-line growth for the business. So we certainly have money to integrate the business. We also have money for the step-up in inventory, which, as you know, you have to do intangible assets amortization, et cetera. So those are the primary drivers. But in addition to that, we'll also spend more on consumer demand building investment. To be clear, it's a business in fiscal 2017 that we're expecting good growth rates, healthy margins. But what we found is it's important to integrate quickly and to lean in and build on the momentum that the great people at Renew Life have been delivering over the last couple of years. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got you. And then will this be a platform for you guys? So is this like a broader entry into the CMS space? Or is this kind of an opportunistic (39:12)? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Bill, we certainly look at this as strategic and I think it's very consistent with what we've said over the last two years, three years since we've begun the journey on the 2020 Strategy. What we said is that Health & Wellness, as defined as in me, on me and around me is a space that we're very interested in, and this certainly is bull's eye. We believe that certainly this acquisition will be attractive for our shareholders as a standalone, but we'll certainly also continue to look at this as a potentially broader platform just like we've done with Burt's Bees. I look at Burt's Bees as a very solid role model for this where the first tranche of value creation came from distribution expansion followed by strong investments in the base business to continue to drive what clearly here is a fast-growing category based on a growing consumer need. About two-thirds of U.S. consumers have experienced digestive health issues, and that trend is expected to continue behind the dietary habits that we're seeing from consumers. So investing in awareness and trial and on the base product certainly is the second opportunity here. And then the third opportunity is to look at adjacent spaces around whether that's organically or perhaps through additional business development activity, and perhaps that it will yield an opportunity to add additional growth down the road. But for the time being, we're focused on driving awareness and trial and distribution on the base product by applying our strong 3D capabilities which I think are a wonderful fit to add to the great work that the current team has already done on the business. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : We'll now take a question from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Morning, guys. First question on the wipes business at Costco. Was there any impact from this quarter? It sounds like it happened in March, wasn't sure if there was a pipeline fill for that. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : No, Joe. This started shipping again at the very end of Q3, so no impact. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then going forward, what's the volume impact you think that will have? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Well, I don't know that we disclosed the specific volume impact. But obviously Costco is a significant customer of ours and certainly what these Costco customers as well as club customers in general are is pretty loyal to the channel. So the volume incrementality certainly is expected to be pretty significant to the wipes business, which will continue to help us increase household penetration on disinfecting wipes. As you know, disinfecting wipes is a business that has been growing share very strongly for us over the last two years frankly. The category also is up 6% over the past 52 weeks, and we're clearly leaning into a tailwind on wipes, and now we're happy to have this business back. What I will say in addition to your question, Joe, is importantly we stayed principled as we regained this distribution. What we've commented on two years ago was that it is always our aim to stay fair and equitable to all trade customers and ensure that all customers qualify for the same conditions, and it's important to close the loop on this and emphasize that that statement has remained true as we've been able to regain the distribution at Costco at this point. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got it. That's helpful. And then switching gears to Burt's Bees, it looks like another double-digit quarter. How much further is there for that brand to extend into other categories? And where do you think the brand has a right to enter from a product perspective going forward? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Well, without getting into specifics, Joe, which I know you'll understand that we can't. We certainly believe that this brand has a lot of potential in three ways. And all of that is consistent with what we said in the past. First of all, just continue to drive awareness and trial on the base business : lip, face, body, we have a lot of products out there that enjoy a very strong consumer loyalty but have an opportunity in increasing awareness and trials, so more consumers can use these products, and that is job number one. And we're driving that through tactics like TV advertising which we, for the first time, did last year and which we'll do again this year and believe we'll deliver solid additional growth just on the base. The second opportunity certainly is an expansion into new categories and we're very pleased with how lipsticks is going. It's now the number five lipstick in a very cluttered market, and it's overtaken some very established and prominent brands. Most recently lipsticks did receive a very prestigious award by Cosmopolitan magazine, who called it their favorite lipstick ever, which certainly is something that we were very pleased to see. And then third, the opportunity continues to be in international, and Steve Austenfeld has talked about that earlier in this call where we believe that both in markets that we're already in as well as in markets that we have a very small presence, there's a lot of opportunity to repeat the success that we've had in the U.S. And we're investigating in that. So category expansion will continue to be name of the game, but it's really part of a three-pronged growth strategy that also includes growth on the base and growth in new countries. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Understood. Okay. Thanks, Benno. Operator : And we'll now take a question from John Faucher with JPMorgan. John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Wanted to chat a little bit about Cat Litter, this is obviously a category where you probably had the greatest competitive headwinds over the past couple of years and probably the toughest for you guys to crack from that standpoint. So I guess as you look at it, how comfortable are you now that this is \u2013 you sort of figured out the two or three pieces that you need to push on in order to get the shares moving in the right direction longer-term, given the fact, again, that you've had so much tough competition over the past couple of years? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, certainly a business that we want to perform better, and as we said earlier, John, we're encouraged by what we're seeing, but we're not done yet. So this will take more time. What we've said is that it requires an increase in investment and we're certainly putting that in place. What we've also said is that will require innovation, and with Fresh Step with Febreze, we're off to a good start. But what we've also said is that it will require sustained innovation over time, and we're certainly working on that and we have respective plans in place to follow up with more innovation later in the year \u2013 later in this calendar year and then next calendar year as well. So this is a journey. We're off to a good start. We have more work to do, but we're certainly encouraged by what we're seeing. John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. And then if I can just ask a follow-up for Steve on the FX guidance. I mean we're not seeing the type of guidance for the type of currency impact that you're talking about for next year. So, are you using forecasts as opposed to spot rates? Or are you potentially looking at another deval that you've built into your numbers from that standpoint? Thanks. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, we use a bank consensus rate, so basically they're forward-looking rates. And it's hard to call the FX markets, as you know. But if you just look at the devaluation that Steve Austenfeld talked briefly about in Argentina and look at the carryover effect of that and then just put on the softening currencies, particularly in Latin America, preliminary estimates would seem to indicate about a two-point drag on sales next year. Probably a little bit stronger in the first part of the year than the second half the year, but we'll have to see. But what's important to note, I think for each country, it's different. So our market participation is probably different than many other companies and that may be driving some differences. John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We'll now go to Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. On the wipes business, a lot of the one-off concerns that drove wipes are well in the past, the virus concerns and things like that. And this was a fairly benign cold and flu season. So I was surprised to see wipes and cleaners up double digits. So can you talk through what drove that? Do you think this is a sustainable level going forward? And how do you feel about inventory levels at retail, particularly given a fairly temperate start to the year in terms of weather, which obviously helped Charcoal? And then obviously, now the greater availability now that you're back in Costco. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Olivia, first of all, congratulations again on the birth of your son. Olivia Tong - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Appreciate it. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : You're right in saying that the cold and flu season has been relatively benign, but we feel like the wipes business has reached a threshold where cold and flu certainly helps, but where the business is no longer dependent upon cold and flu. So the success is really based on several things. First of all, just basic consumer trends. We've talked to all of you before about the fact that this is a very preferred product form as consumers increasingly clean in the flow versus on their hands and knees. So we're just having a lot of consumer tailwinds. Second, we're fueling those tailwinds with innovation, mostly innovation that increases the versatility of use and allows consumers to use wipes in new places, whether that's on glass, whether that's on wood, whether that's in bathroom or, more recently, for the tougher jobs in the kitchen. Clorox disinfecting wipes with Micro Scrubbers has been incredibly successful and is growing market share and we're fueling that success with additional investments. And then certainly the distribution expansion like the one that was talked about will help. So we have high hopes that we'll continue to see strong growth on wipes in the future. Certainly near-term, we'll see very significant growth as we continue to benefit from the Costco distribution expansion, but we think that based on the investment in those few pillars that I mentioned, we'll continue to see sustained growth on disinfecting wipes down the road. Operator : We'll now take a question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Just a couple of questions. One is, as you think about gross and operating margins going forward, what should we think about as we start to lap commodity benefits? Steve, you mentioned flat coming up here, but thinking more about fiscal 2017, because you are lapping commodity benefits. I don't see new pricing on your sheet here necessarily that that's meaningful, A&P up, et cetera. It feels like you're kind of signaling a deceleration of EPS growth for 2017 and I want to get at that through the margin lens first, please. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So let me address the margins. So, first of all, we'll provide the outlook, Ali, in August that we typically do every year. What I do think is important is a trend to call out is commodity prices, which are notoriously difficult to forecast. But again, as I said earlier, energy prices have really started to come up pretty sharply. It looks like the commodity market has stabilized. What does that mean? It means as we go into fiscal 2017, particularly as we move through fiscal 2017, I think some of the benefits we've been enjoying from lower commodity costs are going to start to dissipate. What we can do as a company is focus on the things we can control, keeping the cost savings pipeline healthy, and we're doing that. We're focusing on rebuilding our margins in international with our Go Lean efforts. That's something we're also going to continue. And we're also focused on taking pricing and high inflationary economies. So, I think the actions that we're taking should, over the very long-term, help us deliver EBIT margin expansion in the range of 25 bps to 50 bps, but you will see variability across the quarters and even across the years at times, but I do feel good about the programs we have in place to not just keep the margins healthy, but to build them over the very long-term. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And then if I take that from a top-line perspective as well, I think Steve Austenfeld mentioned this quarter about 20 basis points up on market share. And that's meaningful, that's good. But it does suggest very much to your point as well that your category is accelerating. As you go forth, that's a lot of volume. But what I'm trying to figure out from a category perspective because you're growing clearly ahead of the category but not massively ahead, the category is accelerating. What dynamics do you see there going on in the category? And as you go forward, do you think you'll be able to take more pricing to offset the commodities and so to keep that category momentum going at this pace? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Ali, let me start with the second question, which is pricing. Again, what we've said is we'll price to recover inflation and to protect our margins over the long term, so we would prefer not to take pricing, given the consumer remains at a fragile condition. Nonetheless, at this point, we'll take pricing where we need it over the long term. The key for us ultimately is going to be innovation and driving innovation growth. So here's how we think of it over the next couple of years and maybe into fiscal 2017. We continue to aspire to deliver 3% to 5% top-line sales growth. Now, embedded in that is an assumption that our U.S. business grows at 2% to 4%. I will say, based on what we're seeing, not just with the categories, but importantly our innovation programs and the investments that we're making, we feel very good about delivering solid growth in this range of 2% to 4% based on what we know today. I think the bigger challenge that we have, like many other companies, is on the International side where the slowing economies, the FX headwinds, the challenging environment. I think that's likely to weigh on top-line sales growth for International in fiscal 2017, which is why our efforts to focus on innovation going lean are the right efforts. So on balance, I feel like we're doing a pretty good job as a company. We've got solid plans that we're building now for fiscal 2017 and we'll provide additional color on the August call. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And my last question is just going back to Renew Life. I think you guys have, in Benno's piece, made a good case, a compelling case, for why this is a strong business in and of itself. But I still don't understand why it's a great business for Clorox, why it's a great business for you. It's clearly a different category, a different competitive set, different expertise. So I'm trying to always ask this question of, is it buying growth or is there something you can add to it that's incremental to what they could do themselves or with some other partner? Thank you. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Ali, we certainly believe that we can add to this. So first of all, if I look at just the basic category, fundamentally we're a health and wellness company. So our company was founded 103 years ago today. And it was founded based on disinfecting product and bleach. And over time, whether that's through our Professional Products, through Brita, through Green Works, through Burt's Bees, we have continued to go deeper into health and wellness. And this is just another example. So for us, we look at this as a health and wellness business where our capabilities can make a real difference. First of all, this is the number one brand in the Natural channel, but there's a very significant potential to grow through distribution in food, drug, mass, certainly here in the U.S., but also in Canada and then in international over time. And that's really bull's eye as it relates to applying Clorox world-class capabilities. I would hold up our capabilities when it comes to driving distribution against any company in our space. And we've certainly proven that time and time again. We've also proven that in the health and wellness space through brand building and through innovation we can make great differences to businesses that we acquire over time, whether that's Burt's Bees or, if you reach further back, Hidden Valley or Brita, we pretty much followed the same model. They were pretty small when we bought them, they were new categories for us when we bought them. But we've made an incredible difference and turned them into brand powerhouses. And as we evaluated this space, which we're very familiar with through extensive diligence and as we evaluated the fit with our own capabilities, we got to a space where we felt that we're very comfortable that we're not just buying a business that is profitable and in a fast-growing category, but one that we can make a significant difference to. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I appreciate it. Thank you. Steven Austenfeld - Vice President- Investor Relations : Why don't we take two more questions and then we can follow up offline with any others. Operator : We'll go next to Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, folks. Thank you for the question. I guess I want to come back on the guidance question, or trying to work back into the guidance as we think about next year with the investment. Very simple question. Your long-term algorithm at 25 basis points to 50 basis points of EBIT margin expansion per year, is there any reason to believe that that may be in jeopardy next year as you accelerate the spend? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Jason, again, as I've said, we will provide the outlook in our August call. I think what we did want to foreshadow is major trends and I'll just tick through them. 2 points of FX headwinds, I think that's important. Commodity cost tailwinds, which will likely continue through the fourth quarter, maybe into early part of fiscal 2017. We've got to see. But that's something we're watching closely. We do intend for the advertising investment, which has really stepped up from about 9% of sales to 10% as a company, we think that's permanent. And I think you'll see us continue to invest at that level of consumer demand-building investment, at least for advertising over time. And I would say that when we look out over the next few years, we feel very good about our EBIT margin expansions, but we need to get more information before we provide an outlook on fiscal 2017 on EBIT margin. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah, fair enough, fair enough. You mentioned International and some of the macro headwinds, the currency headwinds, that you're facing there. You came out of the gates this year with some nice progression in turning the margins. They've now turned back against you and pricing is decelerating as FX pressure mounts. What's preventing you from getting the commensurate degree of pricing in these markets as you try to mitigate some of this pressure? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so we are taking pricing in some of the higher inflationary markets. But it's a balance. We've got a very good track record of taking pricing and, importantly, keeping the pricing that we take and keeping our brands healthy. As much as we would love to be able to price recover all of the FX and inflation, you have to take a measured approach with the consumer so that you do it in a sustainable way. So I would say that as inflation and FX has squeezed margins, particularly in Argentina and some of these larger countries, we are taking pricing, it is sticking. But we're trying to do it over time. So it will take time to rebuild the margins through pricing. We're doubling down on our cost savings efforts in some of these countries, applying our U.S. capabilities there, which we think makes good sense. And we're also right-sizing infrastructure investments because we do think the international markets, particularly emerging markets, are going to continue to be challenging. And we want to basically assume a challenging environment and structure accordingly. So I think it's going to take time for us to rebuild the International margins. I do think International will challenge our results in fiscal 2017, but I can also say that I think we're putting in the right long-term plans and executing those well to create a healthy, growing International business for the long-term. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Very good. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Operator : We'll now take our final question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Just a quick question about your comment earlier on kind of remaining true to your longstanding policies of kind of fair and equitable pricing and deals and relationships with all customers. We all know Walmart is kind of looking to invest in price and looking to its suppliers to help in that. So how do you deal with that in that situation when you have a major customer kind of asking for help to contribute to their business, but you've been so steadfast in how you manage relationships across customers? Anything you can help share there would be great. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Lauren, as always, we don't comment on specific discussions that we have on any negotiations with customers, but what I can tell you is that our Walmart business continues to be very strong and that we certainly live up to the fair and equitable principle with Walmart in all our discussions that we have. I'd also remind everybody of what we have consistently said in the past, and that is that the vast majority of our discussions that we have with Walmart are around growth because that's what they're looking for and that's what we can bring. So we talk about how we're investing in their categories. We talk about our innovation, their early adopters on many of our innovations and we talk about how we can grow their categories with both investments and innovation. And we're doing that well. Right now, again, our business with Walmart remains very healthy and strong. And we're certainly working our hardest to keep it that way, given that they're a major customer. So what I feel most positive about is that the premise that we've always talked about that the two companies, Walmart and Clorox, are so strongly strategically aligned continues to be true. Where they're investing benefits our company, whether that's in the improvement of store operations, which certainly helps us, for instance, by eliminating out of stocks; whether that's by investing in e-commerce, which, as you know, is a growth platform for us as well, and remains our fastest growing channel, or whether that's their investments in smaller formats like Neighborhood Markets where they really rely on number one and number two brands of which we have so many to drive growth and assortment. So I continue to feel good about our business with Walmart and I continue to feel good about the progress that we're making based on the focus on how we can grow their categories with our innovation and with our demand spend. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would now like to turn the program back to you. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. So to sum up, I'm very pleased with our performance for the third quarter and fiscal year-to-date because we're making the right investments for the long-term health of the company. Our strategies continue to work, and we're delivering strong results for our shareholders and consumers. So thanks for joining us, everyone, and I hope that all of you will have a great rest of your day. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research) Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Clorox Company Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, you may begin your conference. Steven Austenfeld - Vice President- Investor Relations : Great. Thank you very much. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining Clorox's fourth quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, Clorox's CEO; and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com. Let me remind you that, on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including but not limited to free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA, and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release. Please recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. So turning to our commentary on the quarter. There are three key messages to take away from today's call. First, as planned, our fourth quarter results reflect significantly increased demand-building investments to support awareness, trial, and distribution of our innovation pipeline. Second, we're very pleased with our fiscal year 2016 performance as we made further progress against our 2020 Strategy. The choices we're making to drive long-term profitable growth are working. And Steve and Benno will talk more about that in a moment. And third, we're staying the course with our plans for fiscal year 2017, recognizing we continue to face foreign exchange headwinds, a difficult competitive environment, and commodity costs volatility, as well as a comparison to the strong results we delivered in fiscal year 2016. So with that, I'll cover highlights of our fourth quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results for both the fourth quarter and the full year, as well as our financial outcome for fiscal year 2017, and then finally Benno will close with his perspective on the business followed by Q&A. So turning to Q4, volume grew 7% and sales grew 3% and the variance between volume and sales growth reflects the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, unfavorable product mix, and increased levels of trade spending to drive awareness and trial on a number of our new product launches. U.S. growth, broadly speaking, was strong across all segments, as well as our in International business when looked at on a currency-neutral basis. Excluding the 2-point impact from foreign currency, total company sales in the fourth quarter grew 5%. And if you look at just the U.S., which is more than 80% of company's revenue, sales also grew 5%. So that was the fourth quarter. If you look at the fiscal year, volume grew 4% with gains in all four of our reportable segments. We're certainly very pleased that our growth in shipments was so broad-based across all of the U.S. and International segments. Again, for the year, fiscal 2016, sales growth was 2%, reflecting strong volume growth, the benefit of price increases, primarily in International, about a 0.5 point of growth from the Renew Life acquisition as well as strong growth from innovation. These factors were partially offset by about a 1 point of increased demand spending behind innovation, again, primarily in our core business and nearly 3 points of unfavorable foreign exchange. If you exclude the three points of unfavorable FX, full year sales increased 5 points. For fiscal year 2016, again, looking at the full year, we gained one-tenth-of-a-point in market share across track channels with five of our eight U.S. business units holding or growing share, consistent with our strategy to invest more heavily in demand-building activities behind our growth businesses. Recently, we have seen increased competitive activity targeted in a couple of key categories where spending is depressing pricing levels, the most prominent of which is the Bags and Wraps category. In addition, we have fully lapped last year's price increase in the Laundry business. And that category, which is about 10% of the company's sales, has returned to its historical run rate of being about flat. And in Home Care, disinfecting wipes is another category we are monitoring for the impact of competitive activity. So with all these factors in mind, our outlook anticipates U.S. track channel categories to be up about 1% in fiscal year 2017. Now it is important to note, however, that we do expect meaningful growth in fiscal year 2017 in untracked channels and that's going be across a number of businesses, particularly Clorox wipes, Kingsford charcoal, and Glad trash bags. And that growth won't be picked up in the traditional market share data. So with that, I'll review our fourth quarter results by segment. I'm going to start with our Cleaning segment. In Cleaning, Q4 volume grew 12% and sales increased 6%, driven primarily by Home Care and our Professional Products business. Looking at the fiscal year, Home Care, which is our largest domestic business unit, it surpassed $1 billion in sales for the first time in fiscal year 2016, supported by strong growth of Clorox disinfecting wipes, behind recent distribution gains in the club channel as well as continued base business strength driven by increased investments in demand-building. Overall, Home Care delivered a second consecutive year of very strong market share growth. Turning to Laundry, fourth quarter sales and volume declined primarily due to category softness. And while market shares across our Laundry business were flat, Clorox liquid bleach grew share for the quarter, driven by incremental investments in demand creation, high levels of merchandising support, and increased strength \u2013 or continued strength, I should say, of our premium Clorox Splash-Less Bleach. And finally, our Professional Products business delivered double-digit volume and sales gains in the quarter, driven by higher shipments of professional cleaning products and our base healthcare products, reflecting distribution gains. For the year, Professional Products delivered high-single-digit sales gains on top of high-single-digit gains a year ago. Turning to our Household segment, fourth quarter volume increased 7% and sales grew 5%, reflecting volume and sales growth in each business, along with the benefit of the May 2 acquisition of the Renew Life Digestive Health business. Our Glad Bags and Wraps business saw a high-single-digit volume growth behind distribution gains and ongoing success from our OdorShield lineup, including Gain scented trash bags. Our OdorShield innovation continues to support consumers' desire for value-added trash bags, which has resulted in a meaningful market share gain in our premium trash bag segment. And while the overall market share for our Bags and Wraps category was down due to declines in base trash bags, our strategic focus remains on the higher-margin premium bags. Turning to Cat Litter, volume in the quarter grew as did sales behind our recent launch of Fresh Step with Febreze. We're pleased with the initial response of this launch which contributed to market share growth in the quarter and we plan to continue investing in demand-building activities to drive awareness and trial in this highly competitive category. Looking at Charcoal, the business grew sales in Q4 and that's following a double-digit sales increase last quarter. Sales \u2013 or I should say results were driven by strong in-season merchandising and strength in the home hardware channel. Notably, in the last three years, we have added nearly $100 million in sales on this business and that's on a base of about $500 million. So we've grown the business by nearly 20% and, again, that's just over the last three years. And lastly, within the Household segment, we feel very good about our newly acquired Renew Life Digestive Health business. While still very early at only two months in, initial sales expectations are on track and integration activities are going well. We feel great about the Renew Life employees who've joined the Clorox team and we look forward to providing an update on this business in future quarters. Turning to our Lifestyle segment, volume and sales were up strongly led by double-digit volume and sales gains in Burt's Bees. Growth in Burt's Bees was driven primarily by innovation in lipsticks, tinted lip balm and BB cream, supported by growth as well in the base business. In our Food business, volume and sales also grew solidly, driven by our Ranch With bottled salad dressings. These salad dressings leverage the heritage and great taste of Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing but with an additional flavor such as sriracha, cucumber, cilantro lime, and others. Since our launch of Ranch With dressings, which occurred about 18 months ago, we've gained about 14 share points in the Ranch With segment. Additionally, our Soy Vay Asian sauces and marinades continued to perform well with volume gains in Q4. Our Brita water filtration business delivered flat volume and sales in Q4, as gains in our pour-through and faucet-mount businesses were offset by declines in bottle on the go. And while overall share was down, share trends for pour-through and faucet-mount systems are improving. We are continuing to focus on driving trial and distribution behind new pitchers and better filter value supported by national television ads as well as through digital, public relations, and social media campaigns centering on our partnership that kicked off in March between Brita and Stephen Curry, the National Basketball Association's most valuable player. And finally, turning to our last reportable segment, which is International, and that segment represents a little less than 20% of our company sales \u2013 volume was up about 1% and sales were down 9%, reflecting the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates, an impact that Clorox and our peer companies have experienced for over a year now. Excluding the 14% unfavorable impact on foreign currencies in the segment, sales for International grew 5% on a currency-neutral basis. In the quarter, International grew overall share with strong gains in bleach, surface cleaners, and non-bleach laundry additives behind our select demand creation investments. So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our fiscal year 16 performance and our outlook for fiscal year 2017. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We're certainly very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter and fiscal year. We're performing well in what remains a challenging environment, with incremental demand-building investments driving growth across all our U.S. segments. Importantly, in fiscal year 2016, we delivered another year of margin expansion supported by productivity gains and strong cost savings. Turning to our financial results for the fourth quarter, Q4 sales grew 3%, reflecting 7 points of volume growth which included more than a 1 point of benefit from the Renew Life acquisition and about a 1 point of pricing from International. These factors were partially offset by more than 2 points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, about 2 points of unfavorable mix, largely driven by expanded distribution of Clorox disinfecting wipes at a club channel customer and nearly 1 point of incremental trade spending. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 45.4%, a slight decline of 20 basis points, reflecting about 120 basis points from higher manufacturing and logistics costs, 50 basis points of negative impact from one-time integration costs related to the Renew Life acquisition, and about 50 basis points of negative impact from the voluntary recall of certain Liquid-Plumr products. These factors were partially offset by 110 basis points of cost savings and 90 basis points from lower commodity costs, reflecting an expected slowdown in recent favorability trends which we discussed last quarter. Selling and administrative expenses came in at 14.1% of sales as expected. And as we previously communicated, we've significantly stepped up our advertising and sales promotion investments for the quarter, with an increase of $41 million or 27% versus year-ago to about 12% of sales to drive awareness and trial behind innovation and maintain the health of our core business. Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.26, a decrease of 13% versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher sales, more than offset by significantly higher advertising and sales promotion investments, consistent with our strategy to support our brands. One-time integration costs from the Renew Life acquisition also reduced fourth quarter earnings by about $0.03. And as we mentioned in the press release, one-time charges from the voluntary recall of a limited number of Liquid-Plumr products impacted fourth quarter diluted earnings per share by nearly $0.04. Now I'll turn to our results for the full fiscal year. Sales grew about 2%, reflecting 4 points of volume growth, which included about a 0.5 point of benefit from the Renew Life acquisition and nearly 2 points of pricing benefit, primarily in International. These factors were partially offset by about 3 points of currency headwinds and nearly 1 point of higher trade spending. In fiscal year 2016, our product innovation programs delivered about 3 points of incremental sales growth. Gross margin for the fiscal year increased significantly by 150 basis points to 45.1% compared with 43.6% in fiscal year 2015, driven primarily by 140 basis points of favorable commodity costs, 130 basis points of cost savings, and 90 basis points of pricing. These factors were partially offset by about 140 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. Selling and administrative expenses for the full year came in at about 14% of the sales, essentially flat versus year ago and consistent with our long-term target of about 14% or less of sales. Advertising spending as a percentage of sales for the fiscal year 2016 was 10.2%, a full point higher than in fiscal year 2015. For the full fiscal year, our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was about 34%. And net of all of these factors, fiscal year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $4.92 compared with $4.57 in the year-ago period, an increase of 8%. Fiscal year 2016 free cash flow was $596 million or 10.3% of sales compared with $733 million or 13% of sales in the year-ago period. The decrease in cash flow reflects higher tax payments in fiscal year 2016 and higher performance-based incentive compensation payments related to our strong fiscal year 2015 results, partially offset by earnings growth in fiscal year 2016. In fiscal year 2017, we anticipate free cash flow as a percentage of sales to be in the range of 10% to 12%, consistent with our long-term goal. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures. At the end of the year, our debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.9, just slightly below our target range of 2 to 2.5. And now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2017 outlook. As we mentioned in our press release, we anticipate sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%. And here's how we're thinking of sales growth for the fiscal year. We anticipate U.S. category growth at about 1%, reflecting slower growth rates than what we saw in fiscal year 2016, driven in large part by increased competitive activity at the store shelf in a few categories. And we expect about 3 points of incremental sales growth from our innovation pipeline. We also anticipate 2 points of benefit from the Renew Life acquisition. Our sales outlook also includes 2 points of impact from unfavorable foreign currencies, with more than half of the anticipated impact expected in the first half of the fiscal year, and about 1 point of impact from unfavorable mix. Excluding the 2 point impact from unfavorable foreign currencies, we expect fiscal year 2017 sales to grow between 4% and 6%. Turning to margin, we anticipate gross margin to be about flat, following strong margin expansion in fiscal year 2016, as commodity cost tailwinds begin to dissipate. For perspective on commodities, we've recently seen prices begin to stabilize and we anticipate a modest benefit from commodity favorability in fiscal year 2017 that will likely decline as we move through the fiscal year. We also anticipate unfavorable mix, including new distribution of Clorox disinfecting wipes at a major club channel customer. Importantly, our cost savings pipeline remains healthy and will help offset inflationary pressures and support higher margins over the long-term. We anticipate fiscal year EBIT margin expansion in the range of 25 basis points to 50 basis points; that's on top of 50 basis points of growth in fiscal year 2016, and it reflects lower selling and administrative expenses driven by more normalized levels of performance-based incentive compensation costs and cost savings. Next, as we mentioned in our press release, we're adopting a recently issued accounting standard update that requires tax impacts from stock-based compensation to flow through income taxes on the income statement, a change we believe brings better alignment between earnings and cash flows. Under the previous accounting standard, these differences were recognized in the balance sheet instead of the income statement. As a result, we expect our fiscal year effective tax rate to be between 30% and 31%, benefiting fiscal year diluted earnings per share by $0.25 to $0.30. This change also means we'll likely see more variability in our quarterly and annual tax rates. To be clear, the adoption of this accounting standard will not change the company's total cash flows. Net of all of these factors, we anticipate fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.38 to $5.58. Excluding the impact of the updated accounting standard, fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $5.13 to $5.28. Before I turn it over to Benno, I'd like to share with you additional thoughts on fiscal year 2017. We believe we have solid plans for fiscal year 2017, but continue to face a tough business environment as well as a comparison to strong fiscal year 2016 results. In light of our expectations of slower growth rates in our U.S. categories, we're closely watching the state of the U.S. economy and our consumer. We also expect ongoing foreign currency headwinds to challenge the profitability of our international business. So here's how we're responding. First, we're going stay the course with our 2020 Strategy. It certainly delivered very good results in fiscal year 26 (sic) [2016]. and, in particular, we'll continue to invest strongly behind our U.S. brands and categories, particularly those categories with growth tailwinds and where we have a strong innovation platform. Next, we'll continue to execute our Go Lean Strategy in International, which includes taking pricing and continuing to drive cost savings to help rebuild our margins over time. We'll also continue investing strategically behind select international growth initiatives, such as Burt's Bees, distribution, and product innovation. What's important to know is that international is a strategic part of our overall portfolio and we have leading brands across multiple countries, particularly mid-size countries, with attractive growth rates and a strong consumer base. While it'll take time, we believe that we're taking the right actions to improve the profitability of our International business over the long-term. In closing, we're certainly very pleased about our strong finish to fiscal year 2016 on top of the strong results in the year ago period. We're making the right choices to support the health of our core business and drive the success of our innovation programs. And we continue to support our margins by driving productivity gains, and cost savings. With that, I will turn it over to Benno. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Steve, and hello to all of you on the call. As Steve Austenfeld noted in his opening remarks, there are three key messages we have for you today. First, our Q4 results reflect incremental strategic investments to drive top-line growth that we believe will be sustainable and profitable long-term, keeping the core of our business healthy in a continued challenging macroeconomic environment. This approach is paying off with increased volume and sales growth across our U.S. segments. Second, we're very pleased with our fiscal year 2016 performance and the progress we're making against our Strategy 2020 accelerators, which, I believe, will continue to create value and drive long-term profitable growth in the years to come. On the top line, we delivered 2% sales growth, or 5% on a currency-neutral basis, excluding the 3 point impact of unfavorable foreign currency. On the bottom-line, we grew diluted earnings per share a very strong 8%, which includes our deliberately increased demand spending. We grew market share for the U.S. and International, supported by another strong year of innovation. We entered the Digestive Health category. Two months in, the transition is going well and we're excited to bring the benefits of Renew Life's Digestive Health product to more consumers by building on the success the team has achieved with our proven distribution, marketing, and innovation capabilities. And we delivered top tier returns for our shareholders doing it the right way, by investing in our brands, providing innovation and better value for our consumers, and driving productivity and cost savings in order to not just grow, but grow profitably. Third, we're staying the course for fiscal year 2017. Our fiscal year 2017 outlook reflects a healthy base business, while taking into account ongoing headwinds from foreign exchange, a difficult competitive environment, and comparison against our strong fiscal year 2016 performance. In addition, we're closely monitoring the general health of the U.S. economy and consumer. We have confidence in our strategy and will continue focusing on our accelerators, which are working well for us. We will continue to accelerate momentum in our portfolio with strong demand investments behind our brands. We will continue to drive our innovation program and deliver a robust collection of launches in the back half of the new fiscal year. We will continue to transform how we engage with consumers in the digital arena, with industry-leading levels of spending that are yielding positive returns. We'll continue our focus on productivity and cost savings to fund these investments while also growing margins. And we will continue to draw on our extraordinarily engaged workforce that is driven to create solid and consistent value for our shareholders. And with that, let's open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Dorer. We'll first hear from Steve Powers of UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, everybody. Maybe just a few just housekeeping. So on the tax rate guidance, is the implication that the 30% to 31% fiscal 2017 rate is \u2013 broad brush strokes the right run rate beyond 2017? Or would there be a reason for a reversion back to historical levels? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's actually hard to know, Steve. We certainly believe that's our best estimate for what will happen in fiscal 2017. But as I indicated in my opening comments, there's going be significant variability potentially in both the quarters and the years. I do think there'll be ongoing benefit beyond fiscal 2017 but it's hard to call whether we're going to get a full 4 points of benefit. Actually what I'd recommend that you do and recommend that everybody do in this is if you look at the most recent 10-K that we have out there, if you go to footnotes in the tax section, you'll actually see historically what this benefit has been that's been flowing through equity. And that's probably not a bad starting place to just go back and look at the history on this. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just on the Renew Life benefit in the quarter, I think you said it was just over a 1 point or a 1 point-plus on sales in Q4. Can you talk about just how much that contributed to volume versus sales mix? Because if it's volume then that would signal, I think, a fairly sizable part of your Household segment volume was Renew Life. I just want to clarify if that's the case. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It made a modest contribution to volume. And I would say, it was generally in line with the sales contribution. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Okay. And then I guess the bigger question is just, you spent \u2013 as you signaled you would, spent a lot on demand-building in the quarter both on trade and on A&P. It sounds like \u2013 I guess there's two parts to this question is : how much demand do you think you pulled forward from Q1 or the early part of fiscal 2017? And then as we think about the cadence of fiscal 2017, should we expect that sort of elevated A&P and trade to filter into the first half? Or is there a reason where you can shut it down and start clean in 2017? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : A lot of the incremental investment that we made in the fourth quarter, that we had previously communicated, actually came in the form of advertising. So we don't believe there was any pull-forward on the volume based on what we can see. Again, what we're trying to do is get awareness, trial, and repeat. So we certainly would expect to get some benefit in the first half from the investments we made in the fourth quarter. As far as the ongoing investment level, in advertising, as we'd indicated on the previous call last quarter, we were about 10% of sales this fiscal year, fiscal 2016. We anticipate a similar amount in fiscal 2017. But to be clear, you will see variability across the quarters. We do like to time these investments when we've got innovation and news to talk about. So you could see it go up and down on the quarter, but I would say the incremental point we put in 2016 will remain in 2017 based on what we know today. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's great. Just \u2013 was there any pull-forward on the distribution gain? And then lastly and then I'll stop, any quantification that was material on the bleach plant sale? Thanks. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : There is no pull-forward again based on what we know on distribution and what we can see. As far as the bleach plant sale, just as a reminder for everyone, we've been driving world-class manufacturing for the last several years. As a part of that, our team has done a fabulous job of really increasing productivity. So we made a decision to close the Los Angeles bleach facility, move the volume to other network \u2013 plants within our network. And as a result, we were able to sell the facility. We received a little over $10 million for it, so we certainly felt very good about that. And that did give us a one-time gain in the quarter. Now just as a reminder, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we also had a similar one-time gain but this was on the sale of low income housing partnerships that we had. So they don't completely offset, but I would just remind everyone that there was two one-time gains in each of those two quarters, respectively. Operator : Next we'll hear from Olivia Tong of Bank of America. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks so much. Clearly a big pickup in spend and volume responded. So in response to the first question, you talked about the sort of tail, the benefit in the first half from some of the spending. But when I look at your fiscal 2017 outlook, it doesn't necessarily assume for the full year a whole lot. So can you talk about sort of the puts and takes that are embedded within your expectations for fiscal 2017 top-line? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Olivia, let me try to build on the comments that I made at the opening where we tried to break out, for you, our expectations around category growth, obviously the benefit of Renew Life and innovation. Here's another way to think of it. As we look at the full year for fiscal 2017, we anticipate sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%. Now included in that is about 2 points of foreign currency, which, by the way, offset about 2 points of benefit from the Renew Life acquisition. So you can kind of net those out. And then if I look at the 2% to 4% on the core basis there, I would say the U.S. business continues to perform very well. We think we'll be well within this 2% to 4% long-term growth target that we have for our U.S. business. International, on a currency-neutral basis, we think we'll likely be in this 5% to 7% growth range, but, obviously, when you layer in currencies, which are real, International's obviously going be challenged next year and it's certainly not going be growing. So on balance, I would say, we're feeling pretty good about the U.S. business. It's challenging in International, which is why we're really leaning in to rebuild the margins and accelerate profitable growth, but we think we have a solid outlook. Again, there'll be variability across the quarters as there always is, but we think this is a solid plan. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. And then you mentioned expectations for faster growth in the non-track channel versus the track. Obviously you've got the Costco wipes edition, but what else is driving that greater growth? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Olivia, we're seeing a really strong growth in non-track channels on several of our larger brands. You've mentioned wipes, which is pretty obvious and doing really well in the club channel. We're also seeing very strong merchandising in Kingsford charcoal, which has been on a remarkable run over the last year, in particular, as it relates to home hardware, which also is not tracked. And then we're starting to see what we started talking about perhaps 18 months ago. Our LOOP SKUs, low-out-of-pocket SKUs, that are at the very low-end of the dollar channel and also not tracked. To make an impact, we have 22 of such SKUs out there right now and they're well received as consumers are looking for value at all ends of the spectrum and that's starting to do pretty well. So I would point to those factors in particular, but perhaps to general strength across our portfolio outside track channels as consumers are looking for value and a lot of value is to be found in those non-track channels. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Next we'll hear from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, folks. Thank you for the question. A couple housekeeping questions. One, I guess I was a little surprised by the answer to a question earlier about trade spend and the comment that most of the reinvestment was really focused on advertising. It stands in contrast to the pretty sharp negative inflection on price/mix this quarter. So can you just elaborate a little bit more on what drove that negative inflection, if it wasn't more elevated price \u2013 or more elevated promotion? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Jason, to clarify for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, there's really two things that occurred. One is the step-up in advertising that was previously planned and communicated. That was the $41 million. We also did step-up our trade promotion investment in the quarter, again, to drive additional trial on new and existing products that we have, so both are true. And we reinvested both in trade spending and in advertising, although advertising was a larger piece of that. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And on carry-forward, on the go-forward I know you've commented on this, but just to really nail it home, the magnitude of negative erosion on that price/mix line, that's not something we should expect to carry into next year, correct? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We do anticipate \u2013 well two things. First, as it relates to the top line, we would expect that volume growth will be faster than sales growth. Why? Well, number one is, because we've got FX headwinds. And then second, there's always a bit of mix drag and some trade spending that may drag on that line as well that we're watching carefully. I think turning to gross margins, mix has historically been a bit of a drag on our gross margins and we certainly anticipate that will likely continue in fiscal 2017 and it might even be a little bit higher in fiscal 2017 than we've seen in recent times. And that's just because we're seeing a shift to some larger pack sizes. We did pick up the incremental distribution at a major club account, which is great. It's a nice business. It's profitable. But it has lower gross margins. And one of the things that I think Benno and Steve talked to that we're watching carefully is just the competitive landscape. As we've been talking for more than a year, competitive activity has really started to ramp-up and we'll respond to that accordingly to protect our base business. But that's something we're keeping a sharp eye on. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. One last housekeeping question; then I'll pass it on. I think your response to the other questions indicated that you kind of feel that your reported sales in the U.S. are tracking pretty well with consumption. No pull-forward on promotions; no pull-forward on distribution. So, A, is that fair? And then B, if we assume that U.S., 80% is tracked and 20% is non-tracked, it implies something like \u2013 using Nielsen as a proxy for tracked \u2013 it implies that that unmeasured may be growing like around 20%. Does all that kind of square or fit with what you guys are seeing? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : So, Jason, first of all, your assumption that reported sales is about in line with consumption is correct. I would perhaps offer the perspective on the coverage rates in some categories be well south of the 80% that you mentioned. On some of the businesses, like Kingsford and like Brita, the number actually is closer to 60%. So there is a substantial part of our business that is non-tracked and that indeed is doing very well. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: But overall, for the overall business? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : When you say for the overall business... Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Overall U.S. portfolio. Is the 80%/20% ratio sort of right and is the implied 20% growth in non-tracked sort of right? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : So I don't know that we comment on the growth rate in non-tracked. 80% is a good number for \u2013 like I said for some of the businesses but not for all the businesses. There are several large businesses of ours, and I mentioned two of them where the number is closer to 60%. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Steven Austenfeld - Vice President- Investor Relations : And, Jason, this is Steve Austenfeld. One other factor which clearly is emerging and we've been putting a lot of investment behind it is the growth in the digital channel, so online sales. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Sure. Steven Austenfeld - Vice President- Investor Relations : And I think if that continues, which we certainly expect it will and you're aware of the spending investment we put behind that, then I think you're going see more and more over time of our sales end up being in the untracked channel, at least to the extent that the online or digital space is untracked today. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Right on. Cool. Thank you, guys. I'll pass it on. Congrats on a good year. Operator : Next we'll hear from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thanks for the question. I guess my first question would be, when you look at the new club customer you got, that kind of happened mid-year 2016 and you've been getting a fare (40:37) for that and maybe \u2013 I don't know if there's other reasons. It seems like dollar shipments seem a little bit ahead of what takeaway appears to be. I assume that's the major reason \u2013 correct me if I'm wrong. So does this mean that we're going to see maybe stronger dollar shipments and maybe volume in the front half than the back half next year? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'm sorry. Are you asking about first half sales growth versus second half sales growth or are you asking about... Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : That's correct. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. We typically don't comment on that. We provide a full-year outlook. I would say, there's going to be variability across the quarters. I mean that would be expected. Probably the only thing I will point out to you is I do anticipate that foreign currency headwinds are likely to be stronger in the first half of the fiscal year than the second half. Why? Because we saw a major devaluation in Argentina that we're going to have to work through the balance of this calendar year before we lap it. And then following Brexit, we saw some of the currencies weaken against the U.S. dollar again. So I think that's certainly going to weigh on the first half results probably a bit more than the second half. But beyond that, we'll focus on the full-year outlook and focus on driving long-term growth. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thanks so much for that. And, secondly, just a follow up on an answer to one of your questions on the increased competition. Where is this increased competition broadly coming from? Is it more from private label not taking pricing up as much or maybe taking pricing down in some places? Or is it coming from other competitors who maybe you've gained a little bit of share in major channels again. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so it's mainly from branded competitors. And again, we anticipated \u2013 and it's mostly in the form of trade promotion. And again this is something that we anticipated about a year ago and it's playing out about as foreshadowed. Growth is hard to come by in the U.S. We have a lot of growth and we have a lot of growth coming from innovation. But broadly in the industry, there is not a lot of innovation around, which is why as competitors are looking for growth in a reasonably low commodity environment, they're investing in trade. And we're seeing that in various categories, Home Care and Glad, our trash bags are two categories that we've mentioned in the past and that are playing out as we anticipated. And we can expect that elevated trade promotion environment to stay with us for the foreseeable future as commodities stay where they are. Our approach perhaps, if you'll allow me, it's certainly to an extent respond in kind, so competition doesn't buy share from us that could erode the business in the long run. But our focus mainly is on earning market share, not buying market share, invest behind innovation. Invest behind engaging with the consumer digitally, two things that have a long-term positive effect on our brand equity. So that can mean that we may be willing to temporarily accept share declines; for instance, on Glad where we're seeing that right now, but always with an eye on the long-term health of our business and the profitability. So in a nutshell, elevated trade spend from branded competitors, likely here to stay, and we're applying a balanced and disciplined approach as you'd expect. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Next we'll hear from Ali Dibadj of Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Wanted to ask about 2017 top-line again. So if you exclude currency, if you exclude Renew Life, that gets the 2% to 4% that one's looking for. What happens if you exclude the wipes distribution in Costco? So what's the underlying sales growth? And I don't really know how to think about it because if you go back to \u2013 what was it, March of 2014, it looks like, where you lost that business, there's a negative 8 point swing in volume trends for the segment. But it really only lasted a quarter and there wasn't any mix benefit at that point. So I don't know whether it's 2% to 4% with or without Costco or whether it's 1% to 3% given what we've seen this quarter or even 0% to 2% without Costco for 2017. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Ali, our plans call for, in the U.S. business, excluding Renew Life, to be solidly within the 2% to 4% is our best estimate. And while we anticipate a modest benefit from picking up new distribution on Clorox disinfecting wipes, I would say the innovation is significantly larger. So it's a nice benefit, but I wouldn't overstate the size of the benefit to the company's growth. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : I'd also, Ali \u2013 good question \u2013 perhaps add that the wipes story of success is certainly not dependent upon this new distribution with the major customer. If you look at the size of the wipes business, in March by when we regained distribution, it was actually larger than it was with distribution at that customer two years earlier. So what we expect for wipes is continued momentum with all of our customers, continued growth in all channels because we're driving innovation, because we're supporting the brand through advertising and because we have about 50% of household penetration in the category still to go and the Costco business certainly helps, but it's just one driver behind the strength in the business overall. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So I appreciate that. I mean, is it going to be a 1 point? I mean \u2013 or does it even round to a 1 point? Because again, I'm going back to March 14 \u2013 March 2014, it didn't hit after that first quarter. But I'd assume, yes, you have pallet fill at a Costco or at a club store but you probably still have that until you lap that, right? So are you saying, Steve or Benno, it doesn't even round to 1 point of the 2% to 4%? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Ali, normally, we don't provide that granularity. I'm going to in this instance. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : On a full year basis, it's less than a 1 point. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It does not round to a 1 point. And again, we're very happy to have it back. But what's more important is that we've grown the wipes category as Benno talked about. And this is great to have product wherever the consumer shops but I wouldn't overstate the impact to the top-line. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: That's helpful. You guys mentioned, obviously, several times untracked channels : untracked channels growing more, clearly club, perhaps dollars, certainly online as well. How do you think about cannibalization in that instance? So you're getting this, for example, club channel. You're showing up with Brita on Amazon, et cetera, much more aggressively. How do you kind of factor in your growth going forward, the cannibalization of that versus incrementality? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : In general, that's, of course, always factored into our outlook. There's a certain element of cannibalization always, but the reality is that there's a certain element of channel loyalty, Ali, certainly in club, but also in dollar. So the question here for most consumers is, am I going to buy a Clorox product or a competitive product in the channel versus am I going to buy the Clorox product in channel A or in channel B? So needless to say, there's a positive effect from any distribution gain that we can get across a variety of channels. But there's a certain element of cannibalization, and based on our analytics, we always have a pretty good handle of what that cannibalization is and we factor that in as we think about our sales and profit forecast for the fiscal year. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And you mentioned profit \u2013 sorry, my last question is just on gross margins, so that to us, and seemingly to your stock is actually quite important. And you've had, it looks like five quarters now of really triple-digit basis point increase in the gross margin line. And then this time it was clearly not that. And if you pull out Renew Life, it was still slightly positive, but commodities look like, at least so far, commodities net of manufacturing logistics has turned negative. Pricing benefits very much to the strategy, which I'm not saying is wrong. But the strategy that you're laying out for 2017 is going to be dissipating, trade promo broadly is increasing. How are you going to get gross margins to be flat even as opposed to down for 2017? I mean what are the drivers that are switching that the other way than I would have expected? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. You've got a couple questions in there, but I just want to make sure for clarity's sake, commodity costs were a tailwind in the fourth quarter, but they were less of a tailwind than what we had previously seen. It was about a 90 basis point tailwind. It had been about 180 in the previous two quarters. So to be clear, that certainly was nice. Looking forward, how do we feel about margins? We feel good about the EBIT margin expansion of 25 bps to 50 bps driven by cost savings and lowering our SG&A. I would say cost savings is on track. I feel good about pricing. Most of that'll come from International, but let's see what happens with commodity costs. If that's different, we're not afraid to take pricing in the U.S. if we need to over the long-term to protect our margins. We will likely get a modest commodity cost tailwind in fiscal 2017 based on what we know today. Again, that will likely dissipate. But when we run the math, Ali, with these numbers, and you can take a look at the Web attachments and I think it'll be pretty clear, that gets us to numbers that are about flat with some variability across the quarters. I think, importantly, as we look to fiscal 2018 and beyond, I think our belief is that we're laying the groundwork for continued healthy margin expansion, 25 bps to 50 bps of EBIT, and I think over the long term, gross margins will also continue to grow. But I think fiscal 2017, for the reasons we've articulated, coming off of two record gross margin years, probably closer to flattish. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Next we'll hear from Linda Bolton Weiser of B. Riley. Linda B. Weiser - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Hi. Just also on the question with, I guess, gross margin. Certainly, this competitive activity you're seeing is related to the commodity cost tailwinds. So as we see those tailwinds kind of dissipate, is it fair to think that maybe the competitive activity also dissipates by the end of the fiscal year? Or is there a lag effect and that's more of an FY 2018 phenomenon in terms of a little bit less competitive activity? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : It remains to be seen, Linda. Certainly, what we've seen historically is that whenever there's a more significant uptick in commodities costs that some of that trade promotion activity, and the Glad business perhaps is a prime example of that, generally tends to subside. So that would be our expectation here as well. It's really premature to talk about timing at this point. Certainly, our current assumption is that commodities for the fiscal year are going to be, as Steve mentioned earlier, somewhat of a benefit still and that, therefore, trade promotion will remain elevated. Linda B. Weiser - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then can I ask about \u2013 maybe you talked about this when you announced the Renew Life acquisition, but I would just be curious, what percentage of its sales is online, because that category really does lend itself to online sales? And how does that compare, for example, like to Burt's Bees' percentage of sales online? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Linda, the Renew Life acquisition, 80% is in the U.S. of the sales and within the U.S., the majority of the sales are in the natural channel. E-commerce is a relatively small percentage of sales on that business. We certainly see what you're seeing and that is an opportunity for that business to be a meaningful addition to what is already a strategic platform to invest in e-commerce for the company. And we think that the capabilities that we've brought to the business are going help us with e-commerce. But I will tell you the biggest opportunity, immediate opportunity perhaps for us is to take a brand that is heavily skewed towards the natural channel and in fact, the market leader in the natural channel, to food/drug/mass where the brand is arguably somewhat under-represented and where the growth in the category is really taking off right now. And, of course, that is an excellent fit with our capabilities because building categories and profitable brands with our customers in the food/drug/mass channel is a hallmark of what The Clorox Company's been known for. And we think that that capability is playing very well for Renew Life and that'll be our first growth pillar for the business this fiscal year. Linda B. Weiser - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just sticking on Renew Life, does your acquisition of that business signal a growing interest in your company in the more general OTC drug category? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : I think what we've said, Linda, in the past is there are three areas of interest. It's natural personal care, where we have a beautiful brand in Burt's Bees but where there are brands that are perhaps complementary in terms of which consumer they speak to or a geographic orientation. And we'd love to add to the portfolio in natural personal care. We've said that we like food enhancers as a category that we have capabilities in. And that is a growing trend in consumers and a very profitable category that has tailwinds, so we continue to be interested in that. And then we've always said that health and wellness is an area of opportunity for us and that can have many legs. Certainly, the probiotics category and dietary supplements is one that we've made a foray in now. There're also other aspects of health and wellness that we're interested in. But to your specific question on OTC, that is less of a focus for us as a company. We like businesses that are on strategy and, importantly, a great fit with our capabilities. And as you got from my previous remarks, distribution capability in food/drug/mass is one of our world-class capabilities. And we'd like to take advantage of that rather than build new distribution capabilities that are less center of the plate for the company. Linda B. Weiser - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Next we'll hear from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. You've talked about A&P investments being very targeted toward trial building and some of the innovation. It'd be great to know what businesses in particular you've been focusing that incremental spending on. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : I mean typically, Lauren, what we've said is that we like to skew the investments towards our growth parts of the portfolio. I would say it's been pretty balanced last quarter across multiple brands, whether that's in Home Care, whether that's in Litter, whether that's Burt's Bees or whether that's Foods. I would point you to the areas where we've had strong innovation, and our innovation program of course across the company has been pretty balanced. Burt's Bees in lip and face, Fresh Step with Febreze, which as you've noted, has done well initially in the marketplace, wipes with micro scrubbers, Hidden Valley Ranch With Greek Yogurt and the flavored ranches. So it's been pretty balanced across the board in areas where we felt like we can support innovation that is going to be profitable and that shows a lot of promise in the marketplace. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. And then I just had one more question on Renew Life. First was, about how much of the business is international? Is 10% a decent estimate? That was first. Secondly was just to confirm that you said earlier that the majority of Renew Life flowed through volume this quarter, not in price/mix? And then also, why are you putting it in the Household division? Just curious, reporting line-wise, I would have thought it would have been in Lifestyle, more similarities to Burt's, and I was just curious about that. Thanks. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, let me start off, Lauren, with the last question : why did we put it in the Household segment? Because under the accounting rules, you have to group things with similar economics, and the margins are attractive. They're at company average margins, but the margins are much more closely aligned with the Household segment than they are, say, with the Lifestyle segment. So that's why we made the decision to do that. I'll ask Benno to maybe address your other questions. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, international, Lauren, at 20% of sales, mostly Canada. So that tells you that the immediate opportunity certainly is very focused and very aligned with our capabilities in North America. But mid-term, as we've done, and quite successfully, with Burt's Bees, there certainly is an opportunity to build out this business also in international, given that probiotics and digestive health more broadly is a broader trend. You asked the question on price/mix. Could you repeat that? Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Oh. Sure. It's just that in the quarter, or really in the next three quarters as well, as you're folding it in, is it primarily reported in volume, not in price/mix? Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I don't think we've given a breakdown of price/mix in our outlook, to be clear. But I would say that generally we're seeing, obviously, consistent trends between volume and sales with Renew Life, at least based on what we know today. We've owned the business for 90 days. We've put some initial plans in place. Let's see how that plays out as we go through the year. But, I guess, the takeaway for everyone is, it's about 2 points of top-line sales growth. And I would imagine volume would be fairly consistent with that. But, again, let's get into the year and see how it unfolds. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. What I was just trying to get at is that in year one, not about are you taking incremental pricing at all, just if in year one of the acquisition it flows through volume as it folds into the P&L? That was the point, because the price points are tremendous per unit, so that's why I was asking. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, the focus for year one, Lauren, is on distribution expansion, on applying our marketing capabilities and starting to bring innovation to the business. We're certainly having a keen eye on value, but at this point I would view the key value drivers to be distribution expansion in the first place and just a better awareness and trial behind the many good and differentiated products that the brand already has. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And, Lauren, the only thing I'd add specific to your question is, we convert \u2013 I mean, to your point, the shelf \u2013 the price at shelf is quite attractive on these products, but we convert all of our products to an equivalized volume unit, so even though these products may have a relatively high price point on shelf compared to other products, that's not going to drive the price/mix gain that you're thinking of because we equivalize volume units. And that, we do that for all of our businesses. So maybe that helps answer your question around price/mix. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. It does. Thank you. Operator : Next we'll hear from Erin Lash of Morningstar. Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Thank you for taking the question. I apologize if I missed it earlier, but I was hoping you could give a little bit more detail surrounding the success that you saw with the launch of Fresh Step with Febreze. Obviously, that's a category where you've been challenged over the recent past, and just kind of what you're seeing in that particular space? Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Erin, if I rewind 12 months ago, what we've said is that we like the Cat Litter category because it's got a lot of consumer tailwinds and that what we're focused on as we are \u2013 as we were at the time battling share losses was to earn back market share, not buy back market share, and we've said that innovation is what it would take to do this profitably and sustainably in a competitive category. Fresh Step with Febreze was launched earlier this calendar year. And it's based on a superior proposition around the core benefit in the category in odor control. And certainly, this initiative is off to a very promising start. So we are now seeing sales respond. We're starting to see share respond over the last 13 weeks. The business has returned to market share growth. So we invest behind what we believe to be a very promising and differentiated innovation in this category. And we're also not resting on our laurels. But again, what it will take in a rather competitive category is continued stream of innovations, and we have more innovation to come in fiscal year 2017 to support what is now a tailwind in Cat Litter. Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Thank you. That's very helpful. And then I just had one follow-up. Obviously, you're still digesting and working to leverage the Renew Life acquisition. But just to get your sense in terms of the pipeline for future deals, obviously, you guys generated a ton of cash but you've spoken over the last year or so about the premiums that sellers are demanding and kind of just an update in terms of your thoughts in that regard. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I would say that our number one priority is to integrate the Renew Life business and to deliver against the promise of profitable growth from that business. So that's the number one priority. And then second, let me closely add that obviously keeping the base business healthy is actually critical. All that said, we have dry powder to do more deals. As you pointed out, as we've been pointing out for some time, the multiples the deals have been trading at has made it difficult, I think, for many of the strategics to buy attractive properties. And I think then it's incumbent on companies to try to fish in different ponds to look for opportunities in different places where you might have an opportunity to get a good deal. So we have the money. We have the resources to be able to do more deals. We'd like to do be able to do it, but our number one priority will be to keep the base business healthy, to deliver against Renew Life. And then if we can find a good deal, we'll obviously take a hard look at that. Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Thank you very much. That's helpful. Operator : Next we'll hear from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Bill. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. What was the path to get to the S&A ratio back down to that sort of like 12.5%, 13% range you were at previously? I know the international inflation is obviously wreaking some havoc on things, but it sounds like you're spending a fair bit of money on driving productivity down there. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So we're certainly on track for fiscal 2017 to get this number below 14%. And as you say, Bill, historically if you go back over long periods of time, the company was closer to the 13%. There have been times \u2013 there have been some years where we're actually below 13%. That is when we had the automotive business in, and so we had a bit of a bigger base. And there were some dis-synergies when we divested the business, although the divestiture was certainly a good move, we think, for our shareholders. I think couple things need to be true. Number one, we've got to keep driving cost savings hard. We have to keep really challenging productivity which we're doing. And that's why as we've talked for some time, we've got a glide-path in place over the next three years with every function in this company to make sure we're being as productive as possible. And I think if we do that \u2013 I think if we rebuild the margins in our International business, I do think you're going to see that number continue to float down. The other thing I would just point out \u2013 and this is really consistent with my opening comments on fiscal 2017, we're coming off of two really good years in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016. Our compensation programs reflect that I think we're making an assumption in fiscal 2017 that the compensation will return to more normalized levels, although let's see what happens with the results of the business and that we're a pay-for-performance culture. So that'll obviously adjust. So I think we keep doing what we're doing. It's working. We stay the course. And I think you'll see that number continue to float below 14% which is a non-regrettable choice for us. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, and then this is more out of curiosity than anything, but why do you use a gross debt to EBITDA metric? Pretty much I think the banks will allow to use a net debt to EBITDA if you wanted to. And it seems like you continue to generate cash, so it's sort of like a misleading metric but as you kind of look at how you might use that availability going forward. Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : To be fair, Bill, we look at a lot of credit metrics. We look at gross; we look at net. We also reflect that we do have some cash overseas that we're holding there for investment opportunities over the long-term overseas. So we look at a lot of metrics. I think the important thing to note is we're throwing off a lot of free cash flow. We anticipate 10% to 12% in fiscal 2017 as a percentage of sales. The debt levels are at a level where I think we feel very comfortable and gives us dry powder for deals. And what I've said consistently is over the very long-term, if we've got excess cash we'll look for ways to get that back to the shareholders if we don't need it to support the base business. But again, lots of credit metrics. We look at all of them. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got you. Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would like to turn the program back over to you. Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. So to sum up, we're very pleased to have delivered such a strong year in fiscal year 2016. Our strategy is working and we're staying the course in fiscal 2017. And I look forward to speaking with you again when we report first quarter results in November. Thank you. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Clorox Company First Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, please, you maybe begin your conference. Steven Austenfeld - The Clorox Co.: Great. Thank you. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining Clorox's First Quarter Conference Call. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, Clorox's Chairman and CEO, and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com. Let me remind you that on today's call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including but not limited to free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures, determined in accordance with GAAP, can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the financial results area of our website as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release. Please recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. So with that said, turning to our prepared remarks, I'll cover highlights of our first quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and our updated EPS outlook for fiscal year 2017. And then finally Benno will close with his perspective as well as open up the call for Q&A. So let me start with our top-line results. As this quarter's results highlight, the investments we've been making behind innovation and marketing continue to drive top-line growth, as we saw 8% volume growth in the quarter and 4% sales growth. And as we noted in August when we provided our initial financial outlook for fiscal year 2017, we plan to spend about 10% of sales in advertising and sales promotion this fiscal year, which is consistent with our spend level last year in fiscal year 2016. It's also important to remember that this high level of support is consistent with our 2020 Strategy objective of spending more behind our brands. And as a result, in a number of our categories we benefit from a very high share of voice, meaning Clorox brands are often the only ones speaking to the consumer. In addition, in the first quarter just ended we increased trade promotion spending at a double-digit rate versus the year-ago quarter, both to support defensive activities in a few key categories against some competitive brands but also in support of recent innovation. As a result, as noted a moment ago, first quarter volume was up 8% and sales were up 4%, which included about two points of growth from our Renew Life acquisition, which closed in early May. Steve will talk in a moment to the specific drivers of sales growth. But big picture, it's worth noting that all of our U.S. segments grew sales in the quarter, as did our international business, on a currency-neutral basis. And importantly, this quarter's 4% sales growth was on top of 3% growth in the year-ago quarter. Additionally, our currency-neutral sales growth this quarter, which was 6%, was on top of 6% currency-neutral growth in the prior year's first quarter. So fundamentally, we feel our businesses are performing extremely well. Now turning to market shares, our U.S. 13-week share in tracked channels \u2013 and I want to emphasize that this is only in tracked channels \u2013 decreased two-tenths of a point versus the year-ago quarter, ending at 23.6%. This modest share decline reflects continued competitive spending in a number of categories, including Brita, Glad and Cat Litter. But it is important to note that the tracked channel data I just cited does not reflect the significant gains we have had in untracked channels, including Home Care in the club channel; online sales across our entire portfolio, but in particular Brita and Burt's Bees; continued growth in our Professional Products business; and the great results we've seen in Charcoal over the last few years in the home hardware channel. Looking at category growth in the U.S., our categories were up about two-tenths of a point in the quarter, which is lower than our long-term planning assumption of 1% to 2% growth. In great part, we believe this is due to extensive promotions by competitors, which is restricting growth rates in some of our categories. In response, we remain focused on investing to drive category growth through innovation supported by marketing investments and with the intention of driving trial and awareness. So with that, I'll review our first quarter results by segment. Starting with our Cleaning segment, first quarter volume increased 13% and sales grew 7% behind higher shipments of Home Care and Professional Products. In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business, sales increased double digits. The gain was driven by growth in nearly all segments of our Home Care business, with Clorox-branded products performing particularly well as we continue to invest behind the total Clorox equity. Clorox Disinfecting Wipes reflected record quarterly shipments, as volume was up double digits, and that was even beyond the recent club distribution gains we've discussed. Further, our toilet cleaning business also saw record volume. And broadly speaking, we saw great support by retailers behind back-to-school merchandising. Consistent with these results, Home Care achieved healthy market share growth in the quarter and has now achieved more than nine quarters of market share gains. In Professional Products, we saw volume and sales growth across all segments of the business. And as in our retail business, Clorox-branded products are performing particularly well in both the professional cleaning and the healthcare portions of the business. Turning to our Laundry business, sales declined in the quarter behind decreases on Clorox 2 Stain Remover & Color Booster. However, our bleach market share did increase in the quarter behind gains on our regular and Splash-Less sodium hypochlorite products. Splash-Less, which is margin accretive to our overall bleach lineup, is performing well and is growing household penetration, which is a key objective across the company's portfolio. This is a great example of leaning in on a margin-accretive product to drive profitable growth. Looking at our Household segment, we delivered 6% volume growth and 3% sales growth, in great part reflecting the benefit of the Renew Life acquisition. Starting first with Cat Litter, first quarter volume and sales both increased behind merchandising activity and the new Fresh Step with Febreze innovation we launched earlier this calendar year. And while competition in this category remains intense, we are pleased to have seen a second consecutive quarter of market share growth for the Scoopable Fresh Step franchise. In Bags and Wraps, which is our Glad product line, volume was flat in the quarter, although sales did decline as we supported our brands with higher trade spending in an intensely competitive environment. However, even with this quarter's sales decline, there are some areas of the business that are performing well. For example, we are continuing to see increases in our premium Glad OdorShield offerings. And as we've mentioned in the past, we continue to focus on driving profitable growth in the trash bag category. So we're pleased to see growth in this margin-accretive premium line. Also, our premium food storage bags featuring Disney characters are doing extremely well and we are now extending beyond our initial offerings that featured characters from the popular movies Frozen and Cars to newly launched bags featuring Star Wars characters. In the Charcoal business, sales declined but this was following a very strong fourth quarter in fiscal year 2016. Overall, the Charcoal team expects to build on its great run over the last several years, business remains fundamentally healthy and we look forward to the 2017 billing season. And then lastly, results in the Household segment reflect the contribution of our newly acquired Renew Life digestive health business. For the quarter, it represented about 2% of total company sales but is also expected to grow very rapidly. While still early, as we've only owned the business for about two quarters, Renew Life is on track with our expectations, integration is going extremely well, and we have already realized some of the distribution gains we anticipated when we bought the business. Turning to our Lifestyle segment, volume increased 1% and sales grew 2%. Within the segment, starting with our food business, volume was flat, reflecting very strong performance a year ago when shipments grew at a high-single-digit rate. However, in the quarter sales did increase behind reduced spending compared with a very large promotional event in the year-ago quarter. Positively, market shares on our food business continue to be strong behind all segments of our bottled and dry dressings and our dip business. Turning to Burt's Bees, volume and sales grew largely due to innovation across our lip portfolio, including lipsticks, tinted lip balms and our new strawberry-flavored lip balm, as well as behind incremental merchandising which supported our strong base business performance. We remain excited about our innovation plans for Burt's Bees as we look to continue to drive sales this holiday season, particularly behind lip balm and lip color. Turning to our Brita water-filtration business, while volume was flat sales were slightly down in the quarter due to slowing sales of our Brita bottle offerings. Importantly, however, shipments of pour-through filters, which are really the core of our business, were up during the quarter as the brand continues to benefit from the great momentum we are building through our partnership with the reigning MVP of the NBA, Stephen Curry, of the Golden State Warriors. Behind ongoing marketing, PR and future innovation, we continue to believe this business will improve over time. And then lastly, looking at our international business, volume for the quarter increased 4%. From a sales standpoint, international was flat, which we believe is a really solid result recognizing the continuing negative foreign currency exchange rates. Essentially, we were able to offset foreign currency headwinds through price increases as well as investments we made in certain markets, such as in Canada with the Renew Life business and our Burt's Bees business in Asia. Because of these actions, sales for international, excluding foreign currency, grew 10%. In addition, we continue to execute our Go Lean strategy across our international business, focusing on margin enhancement, which we view to be particularly important, given our belief that foreign currency headwinds will continue through the fiscal year at roughly the current level. So to wrap up, although just 90 days into the fiscal year we are very pleased with our top-line performance. Importantly, despite the continuing challenges of unfavorable foreign currency, our top-line expectations remain unchanged. We continue to anticipate sales growth of 2% to 4%, or 4% to 6% on a currency-neutral basis. Now I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q1 performance as well as our outlook for fiscal year 2017. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We're pleased to start the fiscal year with another strong quarter of volume and sales growth, supported by ongoing investments behind our brands. And importantly, I feel good that we're on track to deliver solid sales and earnings growth for the fiscal year. Turning to our financial results for the first quarter, Q1 sales grew 4% on top of 3% growth in the year-ago quarter, reflecting nearly eight points of volume growth, including the benefit of the Renew Life acquisition, and more than one point of benefit due to pricing actions in our International segment. These factors were partially offset by a combined impact of about three points from unfavorable mix and higher trade spending and about two points of negative foreign currencies. Gross margin for the quarter was lower than we anticipated, reflecting unfavorable mix, which came in a bit higher than expected. Specifically, gross margin for the quarter came in at 44.4% from 45% in the year-ago quarter, when notably the company delivered 220 basis points of gross margin expansion. The 60 basis point decrease reflects 140 basis points of cost savings, 90 basis points of favorable commodity costs and 70 basis points of pricing in International. Our gross margins also reflect 220 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, driven by inflationary pressures, and strategic investments to continue growing our brands and maintain our cost-savings pipeline. For example, we closed our Chicago bleach manufacturing facility earlier this year as a part of our ongoing productivity efforts to optimize our supply chain. Other negative impacts on gross margin in the quarter included 60 basis points of unfavorable mix that I mentioned and about 50 basis points of negative currencies. At 13.9% of sales, selling and administrative expenses increased about a half a point versus year ago and primarily due to the impact of the Renew Life acquisition and increased performance-based compensation costs. For perspective, excluding the impact of Renew Life, selling and admin came in at 13.7% of sales, and we continue to anticipate fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to come in below 14% of sales. Advertising and sales promotion as a percentage of sales was essentially flat versus year ago, while our U.S. retail spending came in at about 10% of sales, reflecting continued support behind our brands. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32% versus 34.5% in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was driven mainly by a 2 percentage point benefit to the company's effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from the adoption of a recently issued accounting standards update. As previously communicated, the benefit realized from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 could vary significantly given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future share-based transactions. And while this year's first quarter tax rate was lower than year ago, it was higher than we expected, as first quarter option exercises were well below those in the year-ago quarter and historical levels. Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.36, an increase of 3% on top of a 20% increase in diluted earnings per share in the year-ago quarter. First quarter net cash provided by continuing operations was $170 million compared with $135 million in the year-ago period. The year-over-year increase reflects higher tax payments in the year-ago period. Free cash flow, defined as net cash from continuing operations less capital expenditures \u2013 which came in at $59 million this quarter \u2013 was $111 million, or 7.7% of sales. For the full fiscal year, we continue to estimate free cash flow as a percentage of sales in the range of 10% to 12%. Now turning to our fiscal year 2017 outlook, we continue to anticipate sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%, reflecting our unchanged assumptions for growth and continued investments in innovation. Excluding the anticipated negative two-point impact from unfavorable foreign currencies, we continue to expect fiscal year 2017 sales to grow between 4% and 6%. Turning to margin, we now anticipate gross margin to decrease modestly versus our previous assumption for gross margin to be about flat, reflecting firming commodity costs and somewhat greater pressure from unfavorable mix. While we benefited from lower commodity costs in the quarter, as previously communicated we continue to anticipate commodity favorability to dissipate as we go through the fiscal year. We continue to anticipate fiscal year EBIT margin expansion in the range of 25 basis points to 50 basis points, with growth expected to be seen later in the fiscal year from lower selling and administrative expenses, driven by ongoing productivity initiatives and more normalized levels of performance-based incentive compensation costs. In addition, we will be lapping a number of items, including one-time integration costs related to Renew Life acquisition and distribution expansion of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes in the club channel. Now we'll turn to our fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. As noted in our press release, we now anticipate our effective year tax rate to be between 32% and 33%, reflecting a two-point reduction versus year ago from adopting the accounting standards update, compared to the previously anticipated four-point reduction. As I just mentioned, there is an inherent uncertainty in predicting future share-based transactions and our updated outlook for the fiscal year effective tax rate reflects the lower-than-anticipated exercises of Clorox stock options in the first quarter and the company's revised outlook for the full-year stock option exercises. Moving forward, we continue to anticipate more variability in our quarterly and annual tax rates as a result of adopting this updated standard. Net of all of these factors, we now anticipate fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.23 to $5.43, which reflects our updated assumption of $0.10 to $0.15 of benefit from the adoption of the accounting standards update versus the prior assumption of $0.25 to $0.30. Importantly, excluding the impact of the updated accounting standard, we continue to anticipate fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.13 to $5.28. In closing, we are pleased with our start to the fiscal year. We're growing sales on top of strong sales growth in the year-ago quarter. And as we look to the remainder of the fiscal year, we'll continue to drive the following priorities. First, we'll stay the course in investing strongly behind our brands to drive our innovation programs and defend against competitive activity we are seeing in select categories. Second, we plan to step up our productivity and cost-savings programs to support our margins in the U.S. and in international in light of ongoing inflationary pressures impacting manufacturing and logistics costs and our expectations for firming commodity costs. Finally, we remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders over time. I am pleased with our near-term actions to support this commitment, including increasing capital expenditures in the first quarter behind growth and cost-savings opportunities. Importantly, despite these investments, we continue to believe that we'll deliver fiscal year free cash flow in the range of 10% to 12% of sales. Bottom line, we'll continue to invest behind our brands, focus on the long-term margin expansion and deliver against our 2020 aspirations. And now I will turn it over to Benno. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Thank you, Steve, and hello, everyone. Here's what we hope you will take away from today's call. First, we are very pleased with the continued strong top-line growth, particularly in an environment where growth is so hard to come by. The key focus for Clorox remains driving good growth \u2013 growth that's profitable, responsible and sustainable for the long term. Driving good growth is important because it means we're winning with the consumer. We're winning with the customer. We're running an operation that is effective and efficient, and we're creating shareholder value. We've been keenly focused on doing just that through innovation, distribution expansion and incremental demand-building investments behind our brands. We have significantly increased our marketing support across digital, trade promotion and other marketing mediums to nurture our growth brands and drive our right to win. And our strong Q1 growth on top of strong year-ago growth is the direct outcome of this deliberate and strategic approach. Second, in the midst of an intensely competitive environment we have momentum on our brands and we're staying the course. In the U.S., our business is healthy and we intend to continue driving it by offering superior value to consumers supported with excellent retail execution, which is something that's a hallmark for us. Notably, and very consistent with our strategy, we are particularly pleased to have completed Q1 with more than two-thirds of U.S. net customer sales growing household penetration. Increasing household penetration is a strong indicator of healthy business growth. In international, we're staying the course. We're stemming headwinds from foreign exchange and inflation with our Go Lean strategy. We're taking a long-term view of the business to improve profitability while making select investments in key growth markets. And I feel very good about the future of our international business, recognizing the fundamental strength of our brands in many countries. Finally, we are taking a long-term view to invest in growth that is profitable and sustainable and to continue to deliver strong ROIC and cash flow to create long-term value for our shareholders. Examples include that we are investing in value-added innovation and have a robust collection of launches teed up for the second half of this fiscal year. We also remain focused on smart investments with solid ROIs, ensuring our demand-creation dollars work harder for us every year. We will continue our focus on productivity and cost savings to fund our investments, improve our margins and reduce selling and administrative expense. And while only a few months in, we feel very good about our Renew Life acquisition and the opportunity we have to make a difference to the business through our 3D brand-building capabilities and through the brand scalability and distribution expansion potential. And with that, let's open it up for your questions, please. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Dorer. Our first question comes from Wendy Nicholson of Citi. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good afternoon. Could you talk about one of the comments you said at the beginning, Steve, was category growth was unhealthy, in your words I think, due to the higher level of promotional activity. But can you talk about how that is driving volume or velocity, if you will, among those categories? Because I guess what I'm wondering is, number one, if oil prices are headed higher, what do you expect? Or have you started to see any changes in that competitive activity? But number two, do you think there has been pantry stocking on the part of consumers because there hasn't been so much promotional activity? Just if you could talk about that comment maybe a little bit more that would be great. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, Wendy, this is Benno. Just to put it in perspective, as Steve noted, category growth was somewhat lower over the last 13 weeks due to the promotional activity that we're seeing. Recall that commodities were still somewhat of a tailwind for us this quarter and therefore it didn't surprise us to see promotional activity across several of our categories, in particular perhaps Glad Trash and the Disinfecting Wipes to be higher and depress that category growth somewhat. We did not see any particular pantry stocking, so that's, again, I expect that this promotional activity is going to subside over time as we expect commodities costs to firm up later on in the fiscal year. And what Steve also did was to point towards the particularly strong growth that we've seen in non-tracked channels. So again, this is an example where category growth in tracked channels really just tells part of the story of what's happened this quarter, given that we've seen such outsized growth on a number of our brands in non-tracked channels. And Steve mentioned some of those and they include but are not limited to Disinfecting Wipes, Brita, Burt's Bees. So we're feeling good about the total top-line momentum that we have, as is evidenced by the strong volume and sales growth in the last quarter. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): It just strikes me as strange that category growth is lower than you would expect because there is a higher level of promotional activity. In other words, the discounting or the price promotions are that high that it's not being compensated for by higher volumes. That's just intuitively \u2013 usually, there's an acceleration in category growth when there's a lot of promotional activity. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, recall, Wendy, that a lot of our purchases in categories that were in routine purchases, so people are not necessarily buying more trash bags or buying more bleach just because it is on sale. What it therefore does do is keep volumes somewhat unchanged and depress the sales growth. And that's exactly what we've seen in tracked channels. It also gives us certainly ammunition to continue the conversations that we have with retailers that price promotion, as we've noted to you and certainly to retailers in the past, don't really add value in our categories. And that over time we expect the promotional spend in our categories to subside and our competitors to return to perhaps more rational behavior that drives our categories the right way, which is certainly something that we're focused on. And the right way means investing in our brand equities and investing in value-added innovation. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Fair enough. And then just the second follow-up question I had is on Burt's Bees specifically. Can you remind us, the Lifestyle segment has been a little bit volatile over the last couple of quarters. When are you lapping the launch of lipsticks? Because I know that was a big deal for that brand. It's a small brand but still I think it was a big initiative. When are you launching that? And where are we in terms of how much more distribution is there for that product and brand extension, if you will? Thanks. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Lipsticks was launched in Q3 of fiscal year 2016, so take a little bit until that laps. But keep in mind that we are continuing to drive innovation on that business, and we certainly also have innovation planned for the back half of this fiscal year. Specific to your question on lipsticks, that continues to do very well. As we speak, we have started to do TV advertising for this brand, and the early returns are really strong. And we expect that initiative to continue to grow in its year two and year three post its launch. We view cosmetics in general as a potential growth platform for the Burt's business, and we'll invest behind that. And lipsticks in particular has been very well received by consumers but also by the press. Notably, we've gained two lipsticks of the year awards by two leading magazines, Cosmopolitan and Allure, and consumers really follow the recommendations that publications like those two make. And we are feeling good about this launch and think that doing TV advertising as we're doing now is another down payment in the long-term success, not only of Burt's Bees cosmetics but the Burt's Bees franchise as a whole. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Terrific. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take another question, and that comes from Stephen Powers from UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Great. First, you may have disclosed this somewhere and I just missed it, but on Renew Life can you just confirm that it was roughly a full contributor to both sales and volume in the quarter? And maybe in doing so highlight for us what volume growth was in Household excluding Renew Life? Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, so Renew Life contributed about two points to both volume and sales growth for the company as a whole. Turning to sales on Renew Life for the Household segment, it contributed about six points to sales growth for the Household segment. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. And then pivoting to gross margins. You mentioned the negative mix and the commodity dynamics, but I wanted to focus also on the inflationary pressures impacting manufacturing and logistics. Was there any timing factor there, or should we expect that drag to continue at an elevated rate? And separately, as you factor in competitive activity plus your own innovation pipeline, can you just frame a bit on the trade spending line over the balance of the year? It sounds from Benno's comments like perhaps we should expect it to remain elevated year-over-year in the nearer term and then perhaps tapering off towards the end of the year as you lap the investments of late 2016. I just wanted to make sure that was a fair read. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Yes, so just starting with the trade spending, yes, we do plan to continue to invest in trade to kind of support the innovation, particularly our second-half innovation that we are pretty excited by. So those numbers will continue. Regarding manufacturing and logistics, in the first quarter it is was about a 220-point drag on gross margin. Now, I would not have you project this forward for the full year because included in the 220 points, in addition to inflationary pressures in international and the U.S., which we do expect to continue, it also includes some one-time investments we are making behind our cost-savings programs and our growth initiatives. And to be specific, that's about 60 basis points. And we are feeling good about the investments we are making. We think they're going to generate nice returns going forward, but I think that number is a bit elevated in the first quarter just because of these investments we're making. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That helps a lot. And then maybe just stepping back, Benno, you mentioned at the end of your prepared remarks the increases in household penetration that you realized in the quarter. I was hoping you could maybe pinpoint which businesses were most incremental there. I'm assuming wipes, just given the growth that we saw, and Renew Life, given that it targets seemingly different customers in different channels from your core business. But were there any other businesses to call out in terms of where you are reaching new consumers and new households? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yes. For clarification, what I said is more than two-thirds of our U.S. volume or our U.S. net customer sales grew household penetration. And it's really broad-based, Steve. Notably it does exclude Renew Life because we do not know what the household penetration was last quarter \u2013 last year, sorry. But really, really broad-based with a skew towards our growth businesses, which is what you'd expect and also tells you that our portfolio momentum accelerator, which is to eventually invest in those businesses that have a stronger right to grow, is really paying off well. But broad-based, certainly Disinfecting Wipes continues to grow household penetration, but I would point out that the Clorox brand as a whole is perhaps the shining star here and that is not limited to Disinfecting Wipes but also includes toilet bowl cleaners and sprays. We have grown our Clorox brand into four million more households over the last year and that is really unique in an environment like this when so many brands in our categories competitively are struggling to gain new households. So we feel good about our ability to connect with consumers based on innovation, based on the change in our marketing approach and the increased focus on digital and the investments that we are making in our brands with the particular focus also on offering superior value to consumers. So really broad-based and feeling good about that. Broad-based, when I say that, maybe a last word, also does mean that it includes our fuel businesses. As you know, we have differentiated the way we classify our portfolio into fuel and growth businesses and we've seen notable household penetration growth also in our fuel businesses, which tells you that also fuel businesses have a right to grow and we're certainly focused on growth in those businesses as well. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for that. Appreciate it. Operator : And we'll go next to Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. So just to go back on a couple of things, top line and margins. If you go back to excluding obviously currency but also Renew Life and then also the expansion of wipes into Costco, just to kind of level set, Q1 growth would've been in the kind of 2% to 3% range? And can you give me the analogous number relative to your fiscal year 2017 2% to 4% range? So excluding the Renew Life, which you do, currency. which you do, but then also the Costco wipes expansion. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Let me try to answer your first quarter question and highlight what we had previously communicated. So Renew Life contributed about two points of sales growth for the company in the first quarter, which was offset, by the way, with about two points of foreign currency. As it relates to Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, the incremental distribution at club, the net customer sales was less than a point. So nice contributor to the sales growth but certainly not the biggest contributor to the sales growth. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then according to your always helpful retail pricing actions, I guess disclosure in the press release, it doesn't look like you've actually taken any U.S. pricing since like February 2015. And a twist on the questions from earlier around trade spend, do you think you'll be able to take pricing up as input and manufacturing costs \u2013 granted, maybe less than we saw this quarter \u2013 but those kind of ramp up and then there's inflationary environment that's growing obviously in the commodities directly. Do you think you're going to be able to take pricing up to offset that? Or do you think it's going to be more difficult going forward? And depending on your answer there, on the other side of the operating margin story is obviously the SG&A bucket, which has been great. Right now it's below 14% is the target. How much more fuel is left on the tank there from a cutting-on-SG&A perspective? Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: So, Ali, you've got a couple of questions in here. Let me see if I can take each in turn. First, starting with pricing. Our fiscal 2017 outlook, as we'd previously communicated and this remains unchanged, we are taking pricing but it's primarily in our international business where we're seeing higher rates of inflation. And importantly, where we are taking the pricing, it's sticking in the market. I think longer term, we continue to believe we've got pricing power in our U.S. brand equities given the health of those brands and the investments we've been making. If inflation does in fact ramp up over the long term, I don't think we're afraid to take pricing to protect our margins. But at this point, it certainly wouldn't be our preferred option. And let's get through the next couple of quarters and let's just see what happens with some of the inflationary pressures. Regarding selling and administrative expenses, we continue to believe that will come in below 14% of sales this fiscal year, really being driven by a combination of our productivity programs as well as more normalized levels of incentive compensation. And most of that benefit you will likely see in the second half of this fiscal year. So as we move through the fiscal year you should see that number come down. We've got plans in place to get that number well below 14% over the long term. So short answer is there's more runway there. It's going to take time, but we feel pretty confident in the plans we have there. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So \u2013 and this is helpful. And so to your former answer, which was on gross margin in particular, can you share your view on what we've been hearing, obviously, from retailers in the U.S.? So long-term commentary about more private label, clearly discussions about ALDI and Lidl coming to the U.S. much more aggressively, they're 90% plus private label, and what the impact is on your business. It has an impact on everybody, but an impact on your business in particular, given some of the categories \u2013 granted not all \u2013 but some of your categories are playing in that area where you say yourself you're the only share of voice out there. So does that shift that we expect over the longer term towards retailers that may be more focused on categories that are private label-prone like yours? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Well, Ali, I'm going to take that. First of all, I think where we're going to see that shift remains to be seen, yeah? So I would certainly say that we're watching that, but we'll have to let this play out. Again, I would point to our sales growth, right? So investing in our brands and investing in sales growth and making sure it's profitable is what it's about, and I think that's what we're doing particularly well. And we're doing that in categories that reasonably are flat more recently, and we have shown that we can grow 8% volume and 6% in currency-neutral growth in an environment where growth is very hard to come by. And that's because our recipe continues to be to invest in our brands. Our innovation is, as you know, margin-accretive, and we have a lot of innovation out there right now and particularly a robust innovation program in the back half. So for us, as we look at the pricing environment and the retail environment, it's frankly relatively stable. And what retailers continue to want is growth, and they want growth the right way. And that's what we're delivering for them, which is why as you look at assortment, shelving, merchandising, in-store, we're winning the game with retailers right now. And we're investing for the long term to continue to do that. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks very much for the perspective. Operator : Our next question is from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Hello. I was hoping to talk a little bit about Renew Life. You mentioned getting some early distribution wins. What types of retailers those are in, if it's mainstream or still kind of more the natural type channel? And also, you made a point of discussing how much it contributes to this quarter's growth, but that it's growing very quickly. So should we assume that the contribution to total company sales growth actually grows through the year? Thanks. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Lauren, let me take the first part of that question. Again, as we've said, we think Renew Life will contribute about two points to sales growth for the full year, and it certainly did that in the first quarter. I think over the next couple of quarters you'll see something fairly consistent. It is a nice-sized business, but it's not the largest business in the portfolio. So while it is growing nicely and it's very much on track, I'm not ready to say it will accelerate the growth rate in the short term. I think we need to get through the integration, start driving the distribution build-out, all of which we have plans to do. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: And on your distribution question, Lauren, so the first objective we certainly have is to maintain and build on the strength that the brand has and enjoys in the natural channel, and we are doing that well. And then the second opportunity is to make stores and food, drug, mass, so our traditional strongholds retailers, where as a company we have very strong capabilities and a strong track record of success. We are doing a nice job to expand distribution there and we are starting to see the benefits of that. But by no means are we done with that, but we're certainly pleased with the progress. This business is doing exactly what we hoped it would do. We are starting with distribution expansion. As time goes by, we will then plug in our marketing and innovation machine and we are certainly looking very closely at the international business as well. One example that Steve Austenfeld mentioned earlier was the really noteworthy growth we've had in the Canadian business and we think that there's a lot more to come. So this is a good acquisition for us that's on track and doing exactly what we hoped it would do for us. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. And then just one clarifying point on CapEx. I think, Steve Robb, you were clear in terms of manufacturing logistics, there are some one-time charges in there given that you're a GAAP reporter. But is that also the case for CapEx, the elevated level had to do with some of these investments and plant closures and restructuring activity? Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Absolutely. The incremental CapEx we're making is really to drive both the growth in the business but also importantly to drive the cost-savings program. And I think as we've said for many years, over the long term it will probably be very close to the level of depreciation and amortization, but we're not afraid to let that float up, either on the quarter or the full year if we see good investment opportunities, and this is exactly that. We let it float up on the quarter. It's likely it will be a bit higher this year than we've seen in recent years, and that's a good thing. It just means that we are finding good opportunities to invest behind. So you will continue to see us lean in to keep the cost-savings pipeline healthy and keep the top-line profitable growth going. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Operator : And moving on we will hear from Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Just wanted to ask you about spending behind your brands. How nimble are you in terms of changing up the buckets of spending behind promotion and advertising? Because obviously you've kept your foot on the pedal on promotion, but ad spend was flat this quarter after a big increase in the second half of last year. So maybe could you first talk about that? And then in addition to the nimbleness question, do you think you have a better sense on ROI on your spend and perhaps can you give some examples as it pertains to a few of those categories, maybe wipes in particular? Thanks. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yes. So Olivia, the spend by quarter is certainly going to vary, so I wouldn't read too much into Q1. What we said is that for this fiscal year we think we have about the right spend and we expect advertising sales promotion to be in the 10% range, which is consistent with last year and certainly increased versus previous years. So feeling good about the ROI that we are getting across all of the buckets and have a really disciplined process in place that allows our businesses to measure ROI across all buckets including digital on at least a once-a-quarter basis and then shift dollars around. And again, the best way for me to perhaps look at ROIs and show that the ROIs are really solid is to go back to the growth that we are seeing in so many of our businesses, which has really been broad-based this last quarter across all U.S. segments and even in international. So feeling good about the ROI that we are seeing and, again, as mentioned perhaps also the past, we leave it to the general managers to decide where they want to spend based on where they see the ROIs. And that could mean that in the business like Burt's Bees we're investing in television because driving awareness behind initiatives like Burt's Bees lipsticks deliver strong return. On businesses like Cat Litter, we're investing in store to drive awareness behind the Fresh Step With Febreze innovation that's been working well for us in store. And then some other businesses like Hidden Valley and perhaps Brita we're spending the dollars more online, including e-commerce, and we're seeing really solid results there. So feeling good about the ability to be nimble and flexible and shifting the dollars to where we're seeing the ROIs. And again, I would point to the strong top-line growth as a proof point. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Got it. If we could dig a little bit more on the legacy Household business excluding Renew Life. It seems like Litter's getting a little bit better; Charcoal, the decline makes sense after the last couple of quarters. But it seems like we go back and forth on Glad a fair bit. So I get that the premium end is doing well, but when do you consider sort of paring back or rationalizing some of the non-premium businesses? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: So if I look at Glad, the volume's been flat after really several quarters of solid growth. And I'd also point to really a comp matter perhaps on that business because if you look at fiscal year 2016, the first quarter, we had a very strong quarter year ago with sales up mid-to-high single digits and profit up very significantly, very highly into the double digits. So I would look at perhaps the year-ago quarter as the main issue here. I certainly expect better results in the coming quarters. As we've noted, competitive price promotions are depressing the category and perhaps also the share. And what we're focused on is being balanced here, certainly responding in kind and we're not afraid to invest in the defense of our brands where we think that's the right thing to do to set a strong signal to competitors that we're not letting them steal share at our expense by spending and price promotions. But we're staying balanced and we're staying focused on long-term profitable growth. So how you see that is that we certainly are accepting temporary share losses, in particular in the lower-profit and lower-price segment. The good news is, as Steve Austenfeld noted, the OdorShield premium segment is still growing. We have strong innovation plans in place for the back half, and we expect the trade promotion activity to subside as commodities firm up over time in the back half. So if you look at this business over a longer period of time, perhaps the last 10 to 12 years, there have been these ups and downs, as you noted, Olivia. But if you look at the long-term trends, they've been very favorable and positive, and we know how to deal with situations like these where commodities are lower and competitive spend is elevated. But if history is a teacher, which we expect it to be, than this will subside and then our balanced and marketing and innovation-driven strategy will continue to succeed. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thanks, Benno. Appreciate it. Operator : We'll go next to Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Good morning. Hey. Can you just drill a little bit more on this gross margin bridge for the year? So do you still expect gross margin to be roughly flat for the year? If you look at some of the puts and takes I guess, like the Argentina devaluation laps, so that probably helps the international business, but I was surprised that there wasn't more pressure from all that Costco volume because obviously Costco's a lower-margin customer. So was sort of curious if that gross margin on that Costco business in the wipes is accretive to the fleet average. And then I have follow-up as well. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: So Bill, couple of thoughts. So first of all, when we had originally come out with our outlook in August, we had thought gross margin would be about flat. As I said in my opening comments, we now anticipate gross margin will be down modestly on the year. Part of that reflects mix, which was a little bit less favorable than we had thought. In the first quarter, it was more unfavorable than we had originally expected. But the biggest change has to do with our expectations for resin prices, which we think are firming up a little bit quicker than we had originally anticipated. So at this point we think gross margin will be down modestly. It assumes commodity costs in total are about flat, so it will dissipate as we had thought. It assumes that we'll still have some drag associated with mix, which we've seen for some time. But importantly we feel very good about our cost savings. And I would also say that at this point we have got solid plans in place to deliver EBIT margin expansion of 25 bps to 50 bps for the full year. And I would also just point out over the long term, keep in mind we're coming off of some very strong gross margins over the last couple of years, but I feel very good about our plans to expand gross margins and total margins over the long term behind our cost-savings programs, also as we lower our S&A costs over time, and as we've talked we've got pricing power. So we're comping a pretty tough number in the year-ago period at 220 basis points of gross margin expansion, but I think we're feeling pretty good about the plans we have in place both for the intermediate and long term. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Gotcha. So you're not going to touch the Costco question. Can just tell me what e-commerce growth was in the quarter and what it is as a percentage of total sales now and if you've make targets on them? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: As a total percentage of sales, Bill, it's about three points, even though, as we've noted in the past, it's much higher than that on selected businesses like Burt's and Brita and also the Professional business. We don't comment typically on specific growth rates on businesses like for any given quarter, but it continues to do very well as we invest and as we continue to win with customers, be it Amazon or be it Walmart.com or Staples.com. We continue to be bullish about this business. As you know, we've been able to double the business over the last three years and we think we can at minimum do the same once again over the next three years and we are investing behind that. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Operator : And will take a question from Joe Altobello from Raymond James. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. Hey, guys. Just a question in terms of promotion spending. Just curious if you guys are seeing any discernible trend in spending between your tracked and your non-tracked channels? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: If you look at the non-tracked channels, it really varies category by category. Look, a lot of the non-tracked channels frankly tend to be less promotionally-driven, right? They tend to be more everyday low price, Joe. So it's hard for me to quantify this in numbers, but off the top my head what I would say is that there's less price promotion in the non-tracked channels. Think about non-tracked channels, e-commerce, home hardware, club, tend to be more everyday low price-focused. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: But in terms of the trend, that hasn't changed all in the last couple of quarters? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: To be very honest, I would have to look it up. It's a level of detail that I would need to look at. I mean, certainly I would expect that in channels where promotional spending happens that are non-tracked, I would think that we're seeing the same phenomenon in non-tracked channels as we are seeing in tracked channels. It's hard for me to give you any highly qualified perspective on what specifically it was in those channels over the last quarter. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: No, that's fine. If it's not on your radar screen, it's probably not a major trend shift, I would imagine. I guess in terms of the wipes business, obviously you guys have taken some significant shelf space from a major competitor. I imagine that they are not taking that lying down. Have you seen them step up spending obviously beyond what you've talked about this morning but more so looking for gaining shelf space outside of the club channel? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: We've noted earlier, Joe, that Disinfecting Wipes is one of the businesses where we have seen more competitive price promotions. I will tell you, though, that this is a business where we are continuing to win in club and beyond and the best way to express that is in the strong share growth that we've seen in the category over the last quarter and the double-digit sales growth that we've seen even beyond the specific club retailer that you alluded to. So we are winning because we are investing in gaining household penetration, which is working well. We're investing in marketing dollars and we are by far the leading investor in brand equity type of channels in this category. And we continue to invest in innovation, which has been very successful, in particular Clorox Disinfecting Wipes with Micro-Scrubbers continues to do very well and keeps growing. So it's a fortress of ours, and we're defending the fortress and we're growing it. And we're winning in the marketplace in club and beyond. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : And this concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would now turn the program back to you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, thank you. In closing, we're very pleased that our investments continue to drive momentum and growth in the first quarter on top of the strong growth we enjoyed a year ago. We remain confident in our strategy and the health of our core business, and we remain focused on making investment choices that are right for the long term. Thank you all for joining us today. Operator : And that does conclude our conference call today. Thank you all for your participation.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Clorox Company's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Release Conference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, you maybe begin your conference. Steven Austenfeld - The Clorox Co.: Great. Thank you. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining Clorox's Second Quarter Conference Call. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, Clorox's Chairman and CEO; and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com. Let me remind you that on today's call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including but not limited to free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the financial results area of our website, as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release. Please recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. So with that said, we'll turn to our prepared remarks. I'll cover highlights of our second quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and outlook, and finally Benno will close with his perspective and then we'll open up the call for questions. So let me start with volume and sales. As our second quarter sales reflect, the continued investments we've been making behind innovation and marketing are driving strong volume and sales growth. Starting with volume, we delivered our second consecutive quarter of 8% growth, our highest gain in nearly 10 years, and with increases, importantly, in each of our four segments. Turning to sales, sales were up 5%, our highest growth in four years with increases in all of our U.S. segments. This sales growth reflects very strong volume on our base business in the U.S. in addition to price increases in certain international markets as well as about 2 points of growth from our acquisition last year of the Renew Life digestive health business. These factors were partially offset by continuing unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Excluding slightly less than 2 points of negative foreign currency, total company sales were up 6% versus the year-ago quarter. So simply put, we feel great about our top line results for the quarter and the first six months of the fiscal year. Our businesses are healthy and performing very well. Now turning to market share, our 13 week share in U.S. tracked channels increased 1/10th of a point versus the year-ago quarter with gains in four of our eight U.S. retail business units. This reflects our demand-building investments supporting recent innovation as well as our efforts to increase competitive activity in a number of categories, including Glad and Home Care. From a category standpoint, tracked channel data reflected a decline of about 2/10th of a point. However, our sales results in the quarter clearly indicate that tracked channel data does not capture the strong performance we're seeing in a number of untracked channels or businesses such as Home Care growth in the club channel, continued growth in our Professional Products business, strong results in the home hardware and pet specialty channels, growth with some untracked retailers that strongly support our Burt's Bees and Renew Life businesses and then finally, the momentum in online sales across our entire portfolio. Notably, there are some categories where e-commerce or online sales represent a top 10 or a top 5 channel with many of our businesses seeing very strong double-digit sales growth. So those are our results on a total company basis. Let me now turn to our segment results. Starting with our Cleaning segment, second quarter volume increased 10% and sales grew 3% behind higher shipments of Home Care products and Professional Products, partially offset by lower shipments of Laundry products. Volume outpaced sales growth as we secured incremental distribution in the club channel and invested more heavily in trade promotion. In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business, sales increased high single digits. This gain was driven by disinfecting products, particularly Clorox disinfecting wipes and sprays, and all-time record shipments of Clorox toilet bowl cleaners as we continued to invest behind the total Clorox brand equity. Consistent with these results, Home Care delivered its 10th consecutive quarter of market share gains. Looking to build on these results, we began shipping in December Clorox Scentiva, our new line of disinfecting sprays and wipes that also provides experiential fragrances. Initially we're offering two fragrances, Tuscan Lavender & Jasmine and Hawaiian Sunshine. While it's still very early, we are pleased with the initial results of these new products. Moving on from Home Care, the Professional Products business delivered solid sales growth in the quarter. As in our Retail business, Clorox branded products are performing very well in the Professional Cleaning portion of the business. We're particularly excited about Clorox Fuzion, a new cleaner and disinfectant available to health care institutions which was launched in September. What makes Fuzion unique is that it kills microorganisms with minimal residue or odor, addressing a significant need in health care. Although Clorox Fuzion was just recently launched, it is running well ahead of expectations. Turning to our Laundry business, sales decreased due to continuing softness in the sodium hypochlorite category. However, our focus remains on shifting consumption to higher-margin products such as Clorox Splash-Less Bleach, as well as investing behind our Clorox 2 color safe bleach. Turning to our Household segment, we delivered 11% volume growth and 12% sales growth. These results reflect the benefit of the Renew Life digestive health business we acquired last May as well as higher sales in all of the other businesses in the segment : bags and wraps, charcoal and cat litter. So starting with bags and wraps, which is our Glad product line, we delivered sales growth driven by all-time record shipments of our premium OdorShield offerings, reflecting our focus on driving profitable growth in this higher-margin segment. And while market share in tracked channels for the bags and wraps category was down, due to a decrease in base trash bags, we continue to see growth in untracked channels with increases greater than 30% of Glad trash bags at some online retailers. Turning to charcoal, top line results were up double-digits. That said, we also recognized Q2 as a relatively small quarter for this business. So charcoal's impact to total company results in the quarter wasn't as large as at other times of the year. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we are launching a new Kingsford Long-Burning Briquet, which will support the 2017 grilling season. In cat litter, sales increased behind the Fresh Step with Febreze innovation we launched last calendar year. And while the category remains highly competitive, we did have our third consecutive quarter of market share growth for the Scoopable Fresh Step franchise. And lastly, results in the Household segment also reflect the Renew Life acquisition, which represented about half of the segment sales growth in the quarter. Importantly, we remain very excited about this acquisition as we continue to gain new distribution, while driving share growth and we have a solid innovation pipeline planned for the second half of fiscal year 2017. Turning to our Lifestyle segment, volume increased 5% and sales grew 4%. I'll start with our Burt's Bees business, in which sales grew mid-single-digits on top of a double-digit increase in the year-ago quarter. Supported this year by innovation across our lip and face lines, such as strawberry lip balm and cleansing oil and strong sell-in on new offerings including glossy crayons, tinted lip oil, Flavor Crystals lip balm and eye makeup remover pads. Burt's Bees second quarter market share reached an all-time high, reflecting the innovation I just noted as well as the strong core business. Turning to our Food business, it also grew sales, driven by bottled Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing and increased distribution of dry Hidden Valley products. Recent product innovations continue to perform well, including new flavors of our ranch with bottled salad dressing such as sriracha, cucumber, and cilantro lime, as well as our Hidden Valley Greek Yogurt dressing. Market shares continue to grow behind all segments of our bottled and dry dressings. And further, we have a strong pipeline of innovation planned for the second half of the fiscal year including the launch of a preservative-free offering called Simply Ranch (12:02). Turning to our Brita water-filtration business, sales were about flat in the quarter, but looking ahead, we will continue to invest in marketing, PR and innovation. And on the innovation front, in Q3 we will launch Brita Stream a Filter As You Pour system, making filtering water in a Brita pitcher 10 times faster. We also introduced the Brita Longlast Filter, long last filter, which filters 120 gallons of water so it lasts three times longer than a traditional 40 gallon filter and reduces even more contaminants, including 99% of lead. And then lastly, looking at our international business, volume increased 2% while sales decreased 2%. Excluding the 10-point impact we saw in the quarter from unfavorable foreign currency, sales grew 8%. Looking forward, we remain encouraged by our ability to execute price increases in key markets as well as our investments in Renew Life, particularly in Canada, Burt's Bees in Asia, e-commerce and innovation in our Laundry business across Latin America and in the Middle East. In addition, our Go Lean strategy in international, which we've spoken to you about during the last year or so, is now yielding results as evidenced in the higher margins for the quarter. We're very pleased on our progress here as this will enable us to offset continued foreign currency headwinds as well as provide funds to continue investing in higher growth international businesses. So to wrap up, we're very pleased with our top line performance for the second quarter and fiscal year-to-date. And based on our year-to-date performance, as well as our updated outlook for the second half of the fiscal year, we now anticipate full year sales growth in a range of 3% to 4% versus our previous outlook of 2% to 4%. Although foreign currency remains a headwind, fundamentally our brands are healthy. We continue to support them with higher marketing support and we have more innovation across the portfolio coming in the second half. So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q2 performance and financial outlook. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Hey, thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. Well, we're pleased to deliver another strong quarter of volume and sales growth, and I feel good that we're on track to deliver solid sales and earnings growth for the fiscal year. Turning to our financial results for the second quarter, Q2 sales grew 5% reflecting 8 points of volume growth, including about 2 points from the Renew Life acquisition and more than a point of benefit from pricing in international. These factors were partially offset by slightly less than 2 points of negative foreign currencies and about 1 point from unfavorable mix. Gross margin for the quarter increased 10 basis points on top of 210 basis points of growth in the year-ago quarter to 44.7% from 44.6% in the year-ago period, reflecting 140 basis points of cost savings and about 70 basis points of pricing in international. Our gross margin results also reflect 210 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs driven by ongoing inflationary pressures and strategic investments to support our brands and our cost savings pipeline. Importantly, we're pleased to see margin improvement in our international business as the team continues to gain traction behind our Go Lean productivity initiatives. At 14% of sales, selling and administrative expenses were slightly lower than year-ago, reflecting ongoing productivity improvements. We continue to anticipate fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to come in below 14% of sales. Advertising and sales promotion spending was about equal to year-ago quarter, and importantly, our U.S. retail advertising spending came in at about 10% of sales, reflecting continued support behind our brands. In the second quarter, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.14, flat versus the year-ago quarter. As we mentioned in our press release, this quarter's earnings results include a $21 million noncash charge related to the impairment of certain assets in the Aplicare Skin Antisepsis business, which reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.11. The charge was connected to an updated valuation of the Aplicare business based on proposed actions we plan to take in response to communications from the FDA in mid-December 2016. Excluding this noncash charge, second quarter earnings per shares were up strongly on top of the 18% growth in the year-ago quarter. While we may have additional future charges, it's important to know that Aplicare represents slightly less than 1% of total company sales. It also only has $17 million in total assets remaining and is a small part of the Professional Products business. Given the evolving regulatory landscape for skin antisepsis products, we are exploring strategic alternatives for Aplicare. Still, this doesn't change the strategic direction of our Professional Products business, which is stopping the spread of infection on surfaces in health care settings. What matters most is the business continues to grow and is on track to deliver against our long-term aspirations. Turning to cash flow, year-to-date net cash provided by continuing operations increased $93 million to $271 million, compared with $178 million in the year ago period. Free cash flow on a year-to-date basis, defined as net cash from continuing operations less capital expenditures, came in at $154 million compared to $110 million in the year ago period. For the full fiscal year, we continue to estimate free cash flow as a percentage of sales to be about 10%. Turning to our fiscal year 2017 outlook, our fiscal year sales outlook is now in the range of 3% to 4% growth versus our previous range of 2% to 4%, recognizing our strong results of 4% sales growth in the first half of the fiscal year and an extensive innovation pipeline in the second half. Our updated sales outlook also now anticipates an impact of 1% to 2% from negative foreign currencies, which is somewhat less than previous expectations for the second half of the fiscal year. On a currency neutral basis, we expect sales growth to be in the range of 4% to 6%. Turning to margin, we continue to anticipate gross margin to decrease slightly, reflecting continued inflationary pressures and firming commodity prices, partially offset by the benefit of cost savings. Over the long term, we continue to have confidence in our cost savings programs, including our Go Lean program in international, and that, combined with margin accretive innovation and some pricing, should enable us to build margin. Advertising and sales promotion spending is expected to be about 10% of sales with much stronger investment in our third quarter, likely in the range of 11% to 12% of sales to support a number of new products in the second half of the fiscal year. We continue to anticipate our fiscal year EBIT margin expansion in the range of 25 to 50 basis points from lower selling and administrative expenses. In addition, we'll be lapping a number of items in the fourth quarter including integration costs related to the Renew Life acquisition and the mix effect from distribution expansion of Clorox disinfecting wipes in the club channel. Turning to our fiscal year tax rate, we now anticipate a $0.05 to $0.10 benefit from adopting ASU 2016-09 versus our previous assumption of $0.10 to $0.15 of benefit. While we continue to anticipate our fiscal year tax rate to be between 32% and 33%, it will likely be at the upper end of this range. Net of all of these factors, we now anticipate fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $5.23 to $5.38, or 6% to 9% growth versus fiscal year 2016. Our diluted earnings per share range includes the non-cash charge and a lower anticipated tax benefit from the adoption of the accounting standards update. Importantly, our outlook also reflects the following anticipated benefits : stronger fiscal year sales growth with the expectation of continued top line momentum in the second half of the fiscal year behind our innovation programs, improving international margins, and an anticipated $11 million gain or $0.05 of additional EPS benefit from a real estate asset sale in the third quarter as our international team continues to right size infrastructure as a part of our Go Lean program. And finally, I'm pleased to report the Renew Life business, which we acquired in May of 2016, is running ahead of our year one expectations. The integration has been going very well and we've been successful in gaining new distribution. As a result, we now anticipate its impact on fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share to be about flat, an improvement versus our previous assumption that it would be dilutive by $0.05 to $0.07. In closing, we're pleased with our second quarter and fiscal year-to-date performance. Importantly, as I mentioned, we're on track to deliver solid sales and earnings growth in fiscal year 2017. As we look to the remainder of the fiscal year, we'll continue to focus on the following priorities. We'll stay the course in investing strongly behind our brands including some exciting innovation across our portfolio. Next, long-term expansion remains a priority. We'll continue to invest behind productivity and cost savings programs, margin accretive innovation and take pricing actions when needed and we're certainly encouraged by our progress in international. Finally, I feel good about our ability to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. Our strategy is delivering strong results. We have leading brands that continue to deliver good value to our consumers. And our core business is healthy and we're seeing signs of improvement in international. And with that, I will turn it over to Benno. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Thank you, Steve, and hello, everyone. It's great to be speaking with you at the halfway point of our fiscal year 2017. The most important thing I want to leave with you today is that our 2020 Strategy continues to work, which is evident in our Q2 results and performance for the fiscal year to date. We had another quarter of very strong volume and sales growth with volume increases in all segments including international. Our marketing support continues to be strong, including significant support behind a number of meaningful product innovations during the first half of the fiscal year and more to come behind a strong innovation pipeline in the second half. We had healthy gross margins on top of strong margin growth in the year-ago quarter despite inflationary pressures and substantial brand building investments. Excluding the $0.11 noncash asset impairment charge Steve outlined, earnings per share were up strongly on top of 18% growth in the year-ago quarter. We're very pleased with our financial performance for the quarter and for the first half of the fiscal year. From a strategic standpoint, I'd like to highlight two areas, our focus on portfolio momentum and our focus on improving profitability in our international business. Starting with portfolio momentum. As a reminder, this is our strategy accelerator for making more differentiated investments in businesses that have a strong right (25:20) to accelerate growth with a focus on increasing household penetration for the total Clorox Company portfolio. And this focus is clearly working, as we are getting more of our products into consumers' homes than ever before. In fact, over three-fourths or 75% of our businesses have growing or stable household penetration and this is more than twice as many as when we started the 2020 Strategy three years ago. This clearly speaks to the fundamental health of our core businesses and the effectiveness of our brand investments. Case in point, our gains in the e-commerce channel, supported by our investment in digital marketing and partnerships with e-commerce-related retailers. Many of our businesses, whether it's Burt's Bees or disinfecting wipes or Glad trash bags or Brita water filters are seeing strong double-digit growth in e-commerce and we're well on our way toward our goal of $300 million in profitable sales in this channel by fiscal year 2020. Also, related to portfolio momentum, we certainly remain very excited about last May's acquisition of Renew Life in the fast-growing digestive health category. The business and all integration activities related to Renew Life are well on track and we're already seeing distribution gains with major retailers, much as we did when we acquired Burt's Bees. Moving on to our international business. I'm very pleased by the work our international team has done to drive margin improvement. Our business outside of the U.S., similar to many other companies, has been challenged by foreign exchange devaluations and related cost inflation. As a result, we've been on a path to improve margins and drive profitable growth in international behind our Go Lean strategy. As evidenced by international's higher margins and strong increase in earnings for the quarter and despite continued near-term headwinds, we are cautiously optimistic that we'll continue to see profit growth in the balance of the fiscal year and over the long term. So overall, very strong performance for Q2 and the fiscal year to date. Before opening it up for Q&A, let me return to my primary thought, which is that our 2020 Strategy is working and we're staying the course with our focus on profitable and sustainable growth. Three years into the strategy, we have made very good progress to date. After two years of very strong earnings per share growth, we are on track toward another very solid fiscal year with earnings per share growth in the mid to high single digits. We will therefore continue to focus on executing against our strategy accelerators, increasing momentum in our portfolio with strong brand building investments, driving our innovation program and transforming how we engage with consumers in the digital arena. We'll also continue to enhance productivity and mine strong cost savings to fuel our investments and grow margins. As always, we will continue to focus on creating long-term shareholder returns. So as we head into the second half of our fiscal year, we're especially pleased with the terrific work by our incredible team of employees around the world to create such strong and profitable growth in an environment where growth is so hard to come by. And with that, let's open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Dorer. We'll pause for a moment. And we'll first hear from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Thank you for squeezing in the question. Congratulations on strong results this quarter. Not a lot of conversation around the competitive intensity that you've focused so much on the last couple of calls. So I was hoping you could update us in terms of what you're seeing out there in terms of the competitive environment. And then related to your margin trajectory, there was some concern that the investment, the re-inflation could cause some degradation. I see in your margin bridges that commodities or market movements on commodities remain a modest tailwind. If you could enlighten us in terms of what you're seeing there on the forward, I'd appreciate it. Thank you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, Jason, why don't I take the competitive question and Steve will answer your questions on margins. So competition really unchanged. Remains elevated, certainly in the three categories that we've mentioned in the past : disinfecting wipes, trash bags and cat litter. We think that it'll remain elevated near term as commodities are still somewhat lower and as there just remains a lot of activity in these categories. Now, what's important, though, is that we're winning in all three categories. With wipes, we're seeing double-digit growth and certainly shares are very healthy. In trash bags, we're seeing a rise in sales, in particular in the premium segments, and the market share also in the premium segment of OdorShield products is up. And certainly litter now has become somewhat of a share growth engine for us behind the Fresh Step with Febreze innovation which is off to a great start. We're feeling good about where we are there. So we like the performance in these three categories despite the continued heavy competitive activity. And importantly, we're driving the businesses in these three categories the right way. So while we're responding tactically on the trade promotion side to send the right signal, as a reminder, quite a bit of the trade promotion spend that we have in these three categories is going towards trial and speed to shelf on the innovations. So that's at the end of the day what our strategies are focused on, investing in brand equity building activities that have an eye on profitable and sustainable long-term growth and in investing in innovation. And we have really nice innovation in all categories in the back half. Wipes, Steve Austenfeld talked about the Scentiva line, which is off to a good start with customers. On trash, we're launching a kitchen bag that we like. And on litter, we're doubling down on the innovation that we've launched last year with a new fragrance on Fresh Step with Febreze that we call Hawaiian Aloha. That's a fragrance that's done very well for us in Glad trash bags. And we have a new packaging innovation that is a trade up and a margin premium for us. So we feel good about the plans that we have in all three categories despite the fact that competition remains elevated. And with that, Steve is going to comment on margins. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, thanks, Benno. So, Jason, on the margin, first let me just say that we're certainly pleased with the margin progress we saw in the second quarter. Our gross margin, of course, was up 10 bps on top of 210 bps in the year ago. And from an operational standpoint, I was very pleased with the operating margins in the quarter. And just looking forward, as I said in my opening comments, we do continue to anticipate even margin expansion for the full year of 25 to 50 bps. And there's a couple of reasons for that. One, cost savings continues to do very well for us. We feel like we've got very good plans in place to lower our selling and administrative costs as a percentage of sales, and I think you'll see that as we go through the year and it will driven by a combination of productivity and more normalized levels of incentive-based compensation. And we're also, as a reminder, going to be lapping a number of one-time items in the fourth quarter year-ago, including the step-up costs on the Renew Life acquisitions. So for a large number of reasons I think we feel like we're very much on track to deliver a good expansion of margin. But I think what you'll see is a meaningful increase in EBIT margin in the fourth quarter and you'll also see us rebalancing our consumer demand-building investments between the third and the fourth quarter. And really, that's just to fully support our new products that we've recently launched and we think there's a great opportunity as they hit shelves to really get the advertising online and start leaning into that. So, overall, feel good about margins and things are unfolding about as we expected. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. I appreciate it. I'll pass it on. Operator : Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, everyone. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Hey, Bonnie. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. I have a question on the sequential improvement in your price mix in the Household segment in the quarter. What drove that? I guess, it doesn't appear there was really a lot of pricing taken in the quarter, so was this driven more by a pull-back in your promo activity, possibly in trash bags? Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, I think, well, from a pricing standpoint, overall, I would say most of this is really being driven by premium innovation. If you look at the Glad business, we continue to see margin improvements over the long term really being driven by a shift to the premium side of that business. And I think also I would point out in the quarter as you look at the segments, our international business had a really nice step-up in margins behind our Go Lean business. So overall, it's the things we've talked about that are driving margins plus some nice improvements in a couple of these segments tied to innovation, our Go Lean programs and other actions that we're taking. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for that. And I just had a couple of quick questions on Renew Life. Benno, you mentioned you've expanded distribution for Renew Life, but could you provide a little more color on that and where you're at with this opportunity? And then separately, we've seen a lot of media and advertisement surrounding probiotics. So I guess I'm curious to hear how you guys perceive the competitive environment in this category right now and whether it's becoming more or less competitive. Thank you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, thanks, Bonnie. So as we said, Renew Life is ahead of expectations for the fiscal year. That's to, not just for earnings per share, which we've mentioned earlier but also in terms of sales and margins. The integration certainly is well on track and like you commented on, we're getting distribution wins with major retailers and we expect that to continue. And that was our hypothesis when we bought this business that, this would be such a good fit with our capabilities in so many ways starting with distribution. And just to name a few in food, we got distribution wins with Albertsons-Safeway, a major food retailer. In drug we're seeing distribution expansion with Rite Aid. And in Mass, we're seeing major wins with Walmart. So it's really across the board. Which tells us that our capabilities are very relevant in this area. And we'll begin supporting these wins with a brand new marketing campaign later in the fiscal year that we're excited about and we're starting to ramp up innovations in the fiscal year back half and certainly expect more to come. So we feel good about the acquisition and it's an example of how we want to operate. We want to keep the core of the business healthy while putting our cash to work if the right opportunity comes along. So the category, of course, commenting on your competitive remark, continues to be growing very nicely and it's a very fragmented category still at this point. So we think that this is going to continue, but the tide is certainly increasing, so right now I look at competition in this category and at advertising in this category as a real positive thing, because awareness and trial behind these categories in the grand scheme of things compared to be some of the other categories that we're in is really low. So this is a good thing and hopefully, obviously also we expect that as we think about the competitive environment, at some points, probably not in the next few years, but at some point there will be more consolidation in this category because it's very fragmented. And our hypothesis is, as we typically do well in other categories, that once this consolidation happens that our company and our brand is going to be a winner. But at this point, competition is good because it raises awareness and trial and at some point, it will be more cannibalistic and there will be winners and losers and we'll do our part so we can be winners. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : Next we'll hear from Olivia Tong of Bank of America. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. On gross margin, the mix has been fairly negative for a few quarters but you didn't call it out this quarter. And obviously, we know about wipes but what was the impact of mix overall to gross margins? And are there any other big movers in addition to wipes? Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Well, when you look at the \u2013 and if you go out our web attachments, you'll see that the all other category, which does include mix, was actually, was nice. It was about flat this quarter. I guess the two things that are worth calling out, first is the incremental distribution of disinfecting wipes at Costco. It's a great piece of business. We're very happy to have it. But there is a bit of a negative drag on that. We'll be anniversary-ing that as we go into the fourth quarter. So that's in the number. But it's being offset by business mix. We were just saying some of our higher margin businesses were growing a bit better in the quarter and as a result it kind of washed that out. I think you're going to see variability in that line item of gross margin as we move through the quarters. But on balance, we certainly feel good about the results for Q2. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thanks. And I don't how frequently you measure this but is your availability at Costco and wipes helping to build trial and consumption in anyway? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. The best way, Olivia, we love to look at this as household penetration. And household penetration over the last year on this business is up almost 20%. So I'd would look at that as a clear signal that, as anticipated, what the club distribution improvement has done is expand the reach of this category. And I'll remind everybody that the total wipes category household penetration is still only at about 50% and the way we look at this is that there's plenty of room to grow. So even though as Steve mentioned, it's a little bit of a negative mix hit that will cycle through in Q4. This is a very good thing for us in the long term and it helps increase the reach in a category that's hot and that we expect to continue to do well even as we will anniversary the distribution win at Costco. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thanks. And then just two last questions. First, the Household business, while the mix got better, the margins or the profit margins on that came down, so can you talk about what's driving that? And then also, you mentioned certain businesses have a bigger online presence than others. I imagine Burt's is one of them, perhaps Brita, but probably less so for Kingsford and bleach, but maybe could you give a little bit more color in terms of which of the businesses have the bigger online presence? Thank you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, maybe I'll start there and then Steve can comment on margins. So as you'd expect, so while we don't necessarily comment on all businesses and the presence online, but businesses that skew younger and businesses that from a logistics point of view are a little advantaged like disinfecting wipes, Brita, Burt's Bees, also Renew Life, they're doing very well. But also businesses that have somewhat of a regular purchase pattern like Glad trash bags, as Steve Austenfeld commented on earlier on have done extremely well. So we're seeing strength on this business across the board with businesses that skew younger, like Burt's Bees and Brita, perhaps leading the way as a nice little sound bite on this. Amazon.com on Brita is now our number four customer. So it tells you that that's a business that's doing particularly well and perhaps where the performance in tracked channels that you all are following is not telling the whole story of how that business is really doing. And then, Steve, can perhaps take your point on margins in Household. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Just turning to the Household segment, I would say actually broadly defined by the way, we saw some nice more margin expansion in a couple of our businesses, including charcoal and litter. The one business I would point to is our Glad business. Now, again, we feel great about the strategy to trade consumers up to the more premium segment, which as a reminder is margin accretive to the company. But the margins were down in the Glad business. Part of this is just a reflection of the firming up of commodity cost, but I think the larger component is really the competitive activity that we've talked about for some time in that category and the step up in investment. So I would say overall the business is healthy. Our strategy to drive premiumization in the category is working but there's a lot of competitive intensity and spending around that and that's really what impacted margins this quarter. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Operator : Next we'll hear from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Hey, Bill. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. The first question I have is if you look at the manufacturing and logistics line on that gross margin bridge, it looks like there's been like 700 basis points of aggregate compression since 2012. So can you just explain what that really is and maybe if there's anything you can do different, like automation or factory closures or something to reverse that level of decline? And then I have a follow-up please. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: That's a good question, Bill. Really what you're looking at over the very long-term is inflationary pressures. Keep in mind, we operate in many countries around the world that are experiencing much higher rates of inflation than the U.S. So what you're looking at is a combination of U.S. domestic inflation as well as international inflation. I think that's the largest part of it. Now more recently, you've seen that number increase beyond the historical trend and that's because we've made some choices to make incremental investments to support our cost savings programs, to support margin accretive innovation, to support capacity expansion behind some of our faster growing businesses. I think as you look into the next couple of quarters, at least our plans call for that number to come down a bit but, to be clear, the inflation will continue. And I think the best way to get after that is to keep doing what we're doing, which is drive the cost savings, tightly control our selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales, take pricing where it makes sense and where it's cost justified. And as we've said for some time, if we can control the controllables, I think over the long term we'll do well on margins. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then the follow up, the $0.11 impairment charge which is embedded in the guidance, it looks like the broad strokes on the guidance, except for the stock-based comp change, is pretty much the same. So I'm trying to figure out how you're making up for that shortfall in the back half unless you already always knew that the impairment charges come in this quarter? And then unrelated follow-up, can you just tell us what percent of sales are e-commerce now and how fast they're growing in aggregate? Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, let me start with your first question. And let's be clear, we did not know about the impairment charge. As I had mentioned in my opening comments, this is related to some communication activity that occurred in mid-December. Okay? And in terms of how we're offsetting this, again, something I opened up in my comments, there's three things I would point you to. The first is just the strength of our base business. I'm very pleased that we've grown 4% in incremental sales growth in the first six months of the year. That's actually about 6% on a currency neutral basis. Our Renew Life acquisition that Benno commented on is actually doing quite well. And while it's early days, we're running ahead of our first-year expectations and that's certainly going to help. And then finally as a part of our international Go Lean efforts, not only are we starting to get traction on our margins but, as you know, we want to not just improve margins on that business but we want to drive economic profit. And one of the best ways to do that is to take a hard look at your asset base and make sure you're the highest value owner. And so as a part of that in the third quarter I'm pleased that we're selling some real estate. And not only will that generate some nice cash flows for our shareholders, Bill, but that will also throw off a one-time gain of about $0.05. So those are three things that I would point out that are a bit different than our previous outlook. And overall, I think we feel pretty good about the performance of the quarter and the year. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: And then, Bill, I think you asked about e-commerce. It's now north of 3% of total company sales and it's growing at a 30% clip. So well on track. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Next we'll hear from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thanks very much. Just a couple of questions. When I think about volume clearly coming in, you talked about price mix being pretty nice, at least sequentially, and volume coming in which clearly has to be maybe somewhat better than expectations. I'm trying to understand why maybe there's not a little bit more natural lift to the gross margin line. I get reinvestment at the SG&A line. So it'd be my first question, like what are the big pieces for that across the company? Because you said price mix was positive. And then secondly, I was kind of blown away to see charcoal as a callout in December. A pleasant surprise here in front of the Super Bowl where I'm going to be smoking some meat. Can you frame the relative size of that business typically in Q2? And I know you called out some distribution gains, but is there something else trend-wise going on there? People buying, smokers getting trendy or something like that that could maybe create a permanent bigger base for that business going forward. Thanks. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, well, let me clarify my comments on charcoal. It was up nicely in the quarter, but it's off-season, okay? So it helped with the margins within the segment, I think that was the question, but I don't want to overemphasize the impact that charcoal was having on the quarter. As it relates to the margin drivers, obviously, we're feeling very good about the volume growth. Of course, included in that volume growth we do have our disinfecting wipes distribution at Costco which generates more volume than sales just because it's a lower price point, but it's still a very attractive business. Renew Life is also included in that. But I would again just reference you to the web attachments where I think we do a very nice job of really detailing out all the puts and takes on margins. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: And then, Jonathan, longer term on charcoal, yeah, there are tailwinds and we're taking advantage of them. One thing we're seeing is that millennials are getting into grilling and they love charcoal. So right now the sale of charcoal grills is actually up. So remember about five years ago charcoal grilling was supposed to be dead and it was all going to be about gas grilling and that trend pretty much has reversed. So we think that creates a natural tailwind. People love grilling. Increasingly, people love grilling year-round. You mentioned Super Bowl and there's certainly certain states around the country where weather-wise charcoal grilling is very feasible year-round and we're taking advantage of that trend. For instance, with partnerships that we have with the NFL and ESPN, but also other things that we're doing with retailers to encourage impulse purchases pretty much year-round. Even though, as Steve said, Q2 is a smaller quarter, but as we now start to get into the season again in the spring, we certainly feel good about the plans that we have in place with retailers to continue to leverage that tailwind that we have in the category. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : Next we'll hear from Ali Dibadj of Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Just a few things. One is, if you go in and exclude the impact of the better-than-expected Renew Life and then the expansion of wipes in Costco, is it fair to now say that the underlying organic sales growth was something like 3%? Almost 3% I guess is the math that I get to, not quite. And how does that work longer term in the context of your 3% to 5% organic sales growth target, given everything you're investing in right now? Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Well, Ali, for perspective, let me take the first part of that. Renew Life contributed about 2 points to growth for the company in the second quarter, so if that helps you do the math. I would just say longer term we continue to feel good about the 3% to 5% top-line sales growth. The biggest challenge, as you well know, over the last year or two has been currency headwinds. Now, we do anticipate those are going to be maybe a bit less than what we've been seeing. Time will tell. And if that's the case then I think you should see the sales growth for the company, as long as we continue to deliver good momentum, which we believe we can, I think we can be solidly in the 3% to 5% over the long term. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. I was talking about organic sales and you have to add the 1% back roughly from the wipes to get you to the 3%, but I get where you're coming from. On margins, so the 25 to 50 basis points EBIT guidance, I get the $21 million Aplicare. I get the somewhat of a reversal from the international sale of real estate. Renew Life getting a little bit better. But it still feels like there's a hole to plug, especially if the A&P is going to be flat between R&D and SG&A. And you mentioned a couple times even a couple of quarters ago that's where the back half of the year, we would see the SG&A come down significantly. It feels like it's going to be very significant. So I want to get a sense from you how much you expect SG&A, R&D together to come down in basis points roughly in the back half of the year. And you guys have always been very, very thoughtful in terms of your benchmarking. Can you give us a sense of where you think an endpoint might be longer term for at least the SG&A part of that? Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. So you have a lot in there. Let me try this, Ali. Starting with the S&A. As we have said I think for some time, we anticipate getting that below 14% for the full year. I think we're making good progress against that. As you look at the latter part of this fiscal year, particularly the fourth quarter, we've got two things, as I mentioned earlier, that are going to work for us. First is just ongoing cost savings and productivity and then the second is going to be more normalized levels of incentive-based compensation which were elevated last year because we had a fabulous year. And I think everybody felt very good about those numbers. So those are the reasons we believe SG&A is likely to continue to come down. For absolute clarity, the other things that I would point to particularly in the second half is, again, about a $0.05 gain associated with the sale of some real estate in international. And, again, Renew Life, this is a full year number but it had been anticipated to be $0.05 to $0.07 diluted. We now think it's about flat, call that about a $0.06 change. So those are the big drivers that I would call out. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. So you've made that clear. I'm just suggesting that SG&A is going to have to come down a lot more. Okay. Then last thing is on international, clearly margins got better there, the business got better quite a bit. Can you just describe the actual actions, besides the real estate sale, which I understand the impact on EPS, what kind of changes are you making in that business just on an operational execution level? As detailed as you can get. Thank you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, thanks, Ali. We're really encouraged by the progress in international, profit up 27% in Q2. Specifically, I would say we have talked about the bottom line actions for a while and we dubbed that Go Lean and the specific actions we're taking on pricing, making our operations leaner, and the Australia real estate sale is just an example of that. Making sure that we only spend against activities that deliver return. Employing our strong cost savings machine that you are very aware of from the U.S. also against international. And we're seeing that now really shine through. But also on the top line, I would say there are things that we're doing that are clearly helping. One is where the pricing that I described also leads to sales growth. Renew Life is working very well, in particular, in Canada. It's a very meaningful and profitable, mind you, contributor and has done extremely well since the acquisition. Investing in higher-margin future opportunities like Burt's Bees Asia, as I'm talking about shifting mix and shifting investments towards profitable items. We're feeling very good about the progress that we're making in Burt's Bees. And then Laundry certainly is quite a profitable business in international and we have innovation that we're driving in the Middle East and in Latin America that's quite successful. So that may serve as a few examples of specific activities that lead us to be in an environment that is certainly going to continue to be volatile and full of headwinds near-term. We're quite optimistic that Q2 will be perhaps the start of somewhat of a turnaround in international and that we'll see profit growth for the rest of the fiscal year and going forward. And as we've also commented on in the past, we're optimistic about this business in the long-term as Argentina, hopefully, will continue to do better as the government has taken all the right actions and that headwind turns more into hopefully a tailwind and importantly the strength of our brands and the operations that we have in international. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Glad to see that start turning. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Altobello of Raymond James. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks. Just want to go back to gross margin for a second. Obviously, a nice sequential improvement quarter-over-quarter. You did call out mix earlier as one component of that, but trade promo was included, obviously, in that other line. It was up pretty significantly last quarter. So curious what happened this quarter in terms of overall trade spend? It seems like it decelerated a little bit. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, that's a good question. You know, I would say, as we had planned, we stepped up the level of our trade spending in the quarter to support our brands. So trade spending was up versus a year ago in the quarter and again, that was per plan. And I think what you'll continue to see us do is invest heavily to get the trial and repeat on our innovation. So I think you'll see that trend continue into the third quarter as well as a step up in our advertising in the third quarter, in particular. And some of that will come out of the fourth quarter. We're just rebalancing the quarters. Steven Austenfeld - The Clorox Co.: I think, Joe, this is Steve Austenfeld, just building on Steve's comments. I would point to two things in that all other line that helped not be as dilutive as has been in recent quarters. One is that foreign currency wasn't as bad on a year-over-year basis as it had been previously, so that helped. And then secondly, the mix effect, which I think Steve talked about in response to an earlier question. Whereas we're still seeing some product mix related to some club volumes as we've discussed. We did have much more favorable business unit mix, mix across the franchise that helped us out there. And since you're looking at this gross margin reconciliation page and I appreciate you doing so and we've gotten a lot of questions on this. If you just fast-forward for a quarter or two and compare versus the second quarter, I think big picture \u2013 and there's always going to be movements across these different drivers, but for market movement, our prediction is it's going to start to be a little bit more dilutive, as we've said. We think commodities are probably going to rise after having certainly been a tailwind over the last year or so. But alternately, the manufacturing logistics line we think will become a bit more favorable. So gross margin may still be challenged for a little bit in Q3. Q4 may look a bit better, but that's the way I'd look at this table in terms of the major drivers on this, in terms of what may change going forward. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Steve. And just one second one. In terms of the bleach category it sounds like obviously still a struggle there. One, did your shares hold up this quarter and two, what's the strategy to reaccelerate that category? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Look, if we look at sodium hypochlorite bleach, which is I think what you're referring to, Joe, our strategy has always been to trade up to the more profitable items and that continues to do well. Splash-Less is a very profitable and a higher dollar-ing, a category that's doing well and will continue to drive that. And then, when we talk about bleach, though, I'd encourage us all to continue to think about bleach also as a broader category. That includes bleach-based sprays. That includes toilet bowl cleaners. Those show up in Home Care. But if you look at those, those are all growing and in part we have record highs in some of those categories and we've had record highs for several quarters in a row. So I would argue that perhaps all the trade-up efforts that lead to higher sales and higher profits in bleach aren't fully reflected in the Laundry category progress, but that if you look at total Laundry and Home Care together, the bleach category is actually doing very well and our strategy in that is working. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson of Citi Research. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Just a couple of things. First of all, was the pipeline sale of Scentiva material at all in the quarter? Is that something we have to think about as we sequence second quarter going into third quarter? And then also on wipes, it sounds like you're going into a category which is awesome, but can you remind us when you went into Costco, did you replace another branded player or did they simply add to the category? Because I'm wondering if, as you come up on anniversary-ing that distribution, I know Costco is sometimes in and out with various brands, is there any risk to you losing any distribution there? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: So to your first question, Wendy, Scentiva pipeline volume in Q2, the answer is no. So not significant. On wipes, this was a permanent replacement of the number two player in the category. There's always risk of distribution gains and losses in club, right, but in general we've done well and we don't expect to lose that business again because the business is doing very well in Costco and elsewhere. And as a reminder, the business, while we expanded distribution in club, also continued to do very well in food, drug, mass. In fact, the business for the most part was up double digits in food, drug, mass as we expanded distribution in club. And that just tells you that fundamentally the programs that we have to increase household penetration with strong marketing, with innovation and certainly with a little bit of trade promotion to counter the competitive activity as they lost distribution in club, is working very well and we continue to be optimistic about the prospects in wipes. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And in the context of wipes but also in a couple of other businesses where you've talked about unfavorable mix, I know there are a lot of moving pieces. But calling it out, hey this is the strongest volume growth we've seen in a really long time, it's also a couple of quarters where you're seeing more negative price mix than we have in a long time. And I just want to understand if you think there's been a change in the cost of doing business, or as we go into fiscal 2018, do you think we'll be looking at a scenario where overall price mix returns to being positive? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, it should normalize, Wendy. Certainly, again, wipes in Costco, that's a significant driver. If you look at volume versus sales, or net sales ratio across the segments, you can certainly see that the spread between volume and sales is most explicit in cleaning, and I would point to wipes as a significant driver there. And as Steve mentioned earlier, we're going to cycle through that in Q4 so that for fiscal year 2018, that mix headwind will go away. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Terrific. Thank you so much. Operator : Next we'll hear from Steve Powers of UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Hey. Thanks. Just a few cleanups, if I could. First, back on the SG&A in the back half question, just to clarify, given the productivity and the normalization of performance-based incentive comp that you mentioned, is it fair to think about that line running kind of flat Q3 versus Q4 in dollar terms? Or do you still expect Q4 to remain notably elevated versus Q3? Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: I'm not going to get into that fine detail, but what I can tell you is this, is we fully expect that our selling and administrative expenses are going to be down on the year. Now you can go look at the first half fiscal year-to-date, look at the math, and then kind of run it. We typically true up some of those accruals in the fourth quarter so you might have more benefit in the fourth quarter than the third quarter, but, nonetheless, I think you're going to see those numbers in the second half, in total, come down year over year and that'll be a nice contributor to EBIT margin and should get the S&A line down below 14% of sales. That's certainly what the plan calls for and what we're executing against. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Fair enough. And then you may have mentioned it but could you offer how much you returned to shareholders through repurchases this quarter? Any expectations going forward for further buybacks that may be in the second half outlook? Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: I think as we've said for some time, we'll periodically go into the market to offset dilution. We did a little bit this quarter. There wasn't a lot because, quite frankly, we're not seeing much option-exercise activity over the last quarters so there just hasn't been as much dilution to offset. I think on a go-forward basis, if you look at the company today, our debt to EBITDA on a gross basis is sitting at about a 2.1. So we're at the low end of the range. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, we're throwing off a lot of cash so I think over the next year or two, it's likely if we start to build up excess cash in partnership with the board, we'll have to look at either additional inorganic growth opportunities which we'll continue to look for, obviously, or some way of returning money back to our shareholders. But what we will try to avoid because it's not good for our shareholders or economic profit is building up cash that we just don't need. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then lastly, just on the wipes discussion a moment ago, as you lap the Costco win and as you lap, as you said, a lot of activity in the category across all channels looking back over the last three quarters or so, what's the outlook for that category and for your business, again, as you're cycling all this? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, Steve, so like I said earlier, we expect this category to continue to grow and we expect our brands to continue to lead to sales growth in the category. So there are some things that we're lapping. Certainly, the Costco distribution win is one, but I will remind everybody that sales also in food, drug, mass and certainly in other non-tracked channels is up quite nicely. And I think you've heard us talk about Scentiva as the latest innovation that's been received by customers very favorably to date. We'll continue to support the business with innovation. We'll continue to support the business with strong marketing programs. And this is a business that continues to have a tailwind. Like I said earlier, household penetration in the total category hovers right at around 50%, and we look at that as glass half-empty and think we have a lot more to go given that household penetration in several of the other Home Care categories is significantly higher. And the reality is that the wipes product form is beginning to be the most preferred product form by consumers, and we're leveraging that tailwind. So expecting continued solid growth in the category even post Q4. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Next we'll hear from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon. I was hoping you guys could talk a little bit about Brita. I thought the conversation around coming innovation, particularly in filters was really interesting. So, one, is this the first time that you've had this sort of magnitude of innovation of news and so on, on the filters? Two, do the filters fit in existing pitcher? Does it come with a pitcher kind of trade out dynamic? And then three, are they generally at a price premium to what's in the market today? Thanks. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, Lauren, if you think back about the conversations that we've had with you and investors over the last year or two, we've always said that on the two businesses where we think we can do better, litter and Brita, we want to turn those around, but we want to do it the right way, meaning profitably and in ways that are sustainable. And certainly, in litter, we've done exactly that and we've also said that in Brita it would take time until we have innovation, and that time is now. So we'll invest in the back half quite significantly behind strong innovation plan, which has two components. First of all, what we call Brita Stream pitchers, which by the way, has Stephen Curry on packaging, which pops at shelf really nicely. And these pitchers address a barrier in the category and that's convenience. So you can filter as you pour and it makes the filter experience much faster. You can filter water about 10 times as fast as with traditional filters in the category. So great design, very contemporary and upbeat and filter as you pour. So I feel good about that. And then second, as you mentioned, Longlast filter, they last 3 times as long and are going to specifically target those consumers who aren't replacing their filters as consistently perhaps as we would like them to. The filter also removes lead, 99%, so we can make that claim, and it's a much better value compared to a branded and also on a relative term private label filters in the marketplace. So that, of course, addresses value as something that has held us back in share a little bit over the last few years in the category. And we expect that the two innovations together in addressing the two major opportunities in convenience and value should do quite well on top. We have a new ad campaign, again, featuring Stephen Curry, the NBA's MVP, that was very well received in premarket testing and that will go out into spring. So as a result, clearly we want this business to do better. It is doing much better in non-tracked channels than it is in tracked channels but we're feeling positive about the plans based on innovations both product as well as in other areas and the support that we get from retailers behind those. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. And, sorry, the new filter, sorry, the long-lasting filter, the one that removes lead, does that also fit in the new pitchers? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. I missed out on that. It does not fit with the Stream pitchers. That's a separate filter, but it does fit with all the other pitchers that we sell. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Cool. Thank you so much. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Thanks, Laura. Steven Austenfeld - The Clorox Co.: Why don't we take a question from one last caller? Operator : And actually this concludes the question and answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would like to turn the program back over to you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, thank you. In closing, we're very pleased with our results for Q2 and the fiscal year-to-date. And that, of course, reflects continued investments in support of our 2020 Strategy. Our strategy is working and we're staying the course with our focus on accelerating profitable and sustainable growth. So thanks again for joining us today, and we'll see you all at CAGNY. Bye, everyone. Operator : And this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Clorox Company Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, you may begin your conference. Steven Austenfeld - The Clorox Co.: Thank you. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining Clorox's third quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, Clorox's Chairman and CEO; and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com. Let me remind you that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the financial results area of our website as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release. Please recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. So with that, we'll now turn to our prepared remarks. I'll cover our highlights of our third quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and outlook, and then finally, Benno will close with his perspective. And then we'll open up the call for your questions. So let me start with our top line results. In the third quarter, we reported 4% sales growth, which is really building on the results we've seen year-to-date. And, I think it's worth noting, this is in a consumer environment, where generally growth has been hard to achieve. Helping drive these results for Clorox are the investments we've made in our brands, including in innovation, and I'll be talking more about that in a moment. So let me start with our Cleaning segment. In our Cleaning segment, we saw third quarter volume increase 13% and sales grew 7%, and this was behind higher shipments of Home Care and Professional Products. And sales growth, while quite strong at 7%, did lag volume growth primarily due to unfavorable mix from incremental distribution in the club channel, as well as our higher investment in trade promotion in the quarter. In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased double digits and this gain was driven by very strong volume growth, particularly from disinfecting products with record third quarter shipments of Clorox disinfecting wipes behind club channel distribution, as well as from our new Clorox Scentiva line of disinfecting wipes and sprays. These products provide an experiential fragrance while cleaning the home, and while still early, Clorox Scentiva is off to a strong start. If you look across all of Home Care, the gains in volume were really very broad-based across both channels and the entire portfolio. And this is really consistent with our results because, as we saw, the business unit delivered its 11th consecutive quarter of market share gains. Moving to the Professional Products business, it delivered strong sales growth in the quarter with continued strength in professional cleaning, driven by Clorox disinfecting wipes, Pine-Sol and Glad, aided in part by strength in B2B e-commerce channels. And in professional healthcare, the new product we discussed with you last quarter, Clorox Fuzion, continues to run well ahead of expectations. As a reminder, Fuzion is a new cleaner and disinfectant for healthcare institutions that kills microorganisms, but with minimal residue or odor which addresses a significant need in the healthcare business. Turning to our Laundry business, sales decreased slightly largely due to continuing softness in our Clorox 2 color-safe laundry additive business. However, our strategy for the entire Laundry business remains unchanged as we continue to trade up consumers to more value-added offerings such as Clorox Splash-less Bleach, which is doing quite well, as well as leveraging the Clorox equity across both Laundry and Cleaning, which is reflected in the success we've seen in our Home Care business. Turning to our Household segment, we delivered 9% volume growth and 4% sales growth. Lower third quarter sales in Charcoal were more than offset by the benefit of the Renew Life digestive health business we acquired last May, as well as from higher sales in Cat Litter. Starting with Charcoal, sales and volume were down in Q3, but this was following high single-digit growth in the year-ago quarter. So simply put, we were facing some pretty challenging comparisons versus a year ago. Looking at this year, the initial ramp-up for the summer barbecuing season was a bit slow, in part due to poor March weather, and it also skewed slightly away from our premium instant-lighting product, Match Light, resulting in an unfavorable mix impacting Q3. But, as a reminder, the bulk of our Charcoal business occurs in the fourth quarter, which is the current quarter that we're in now, and we're supporting the 2017 grilling season with our new premium Kingsford long-burning briquette that we started shipping in January. Turning to Cat Litter, sales increased strongly, supported by all-time record shipments of Scoop Away and strong shipments of Fresh Step, primarily due to increased merchandising support, the Fresh Step with Febreze innovation, and strength in the grocery channel. And while still early, our new Fresh Step Hawaiian Aloha item, which began shipping in January, is off to a strong start. And while the category remains highly competitive, we did have our fourth consecutive quarter of market share growth for the Scoopable Fresh Step franchise. Turning to Glad Bags and Wraps, sales came in flat for the quarter with volume down slightly, driven by a softness in our food protection business. However, our premium trash bag business, particularly behind OdorShield, continues to grow, consistent with our strategy to support retailers in trading up consumers to more value-added offerings. And then I'll wrap up the discussion of the Household segment with Renew Life, which contributed strongly to the segment's growth this quarter. You know, in short, we remain very excited about this acquisition. Again, we made this acquisition about a year ago, this month. And we continue to be focused on distribution expansion strategy. That remains on track, and we feel very optimistic about future distribution opportunities. Turning to our Lifestyle segment, volume decreased 1%, and sales decreased 3%. And the slight decline in volume was primarily driven by lower shipments in Water Filtration and Natural Personal Care, reflecting comparisons to double-digit volume growth in both businesses in the year-ago quarter. So, starting with our Brita water-filtration business, despite the sales and volume decline due to tough comps, again, particularly on our faucet mount products, our Q3 shipments this year on our pour-through systems and filters increased behind our latest wave of innovation, and specifically that was on a couple of products launched in mid-February. At that point, we started shipping our new Brita Stream Filter As You Pour Pitcher, which makes filtering water ten times faster, as well as our premium Brita Longlast Filter, which lasts three times longer than legacy filters and reduces more contaminants, including removing 99% of lead. Looking at Burt's Bees, Q3 sales and volume declined in comparison again to double-digit volume gains in the year-ago quarter as we lapped the launch of Burt's Bees lipsticks. At the same time, our lip balm business continues to perform very well with record third quarter shipments. And looking ahead to fiscal year 2018, we have strong plans in place for innovation in several areas to keep growing this business. Turning to our Food business, sales decreased and volume was flat for the quarter as we made significant incremental investments in March that are anticipated to contribute meaningfully to fourth quarter volume growth in support of new products. And these include Simply Ranch, a preservative-free offering in our original ranch lineup, and two new flavors of ranch, chili lime and cucumber basil. We're also leveraging the strength of the Kingsford brand, our Charcoal brand, by launching a new line of barbecue sauces. And then finally looking at our International business, sales increased 3%, while volume declined 2%. The modest volume decline was mostly due to lower shipments in certain Latin America countries, notably Argentina, driven by macroeconomic conditions. Partially offsetting this were increased shipments in Canada, which benefited from the Renew Life acquisition. And broadly speaking, although macroeconomic conditions remain tough, we are encouraged by the progress in our International business as our go-in strategy to improve profitability is also providing for selective investments in key markets which will support future top line growth. For example, in recent quarters, we have launched laundry innovations in several international markets that are off to a good start, including in Asia and Latin America. So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve to provide more detail on our Q3 performance and financial outlook. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Well, thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We're pleased to deliver another strong quarter of both volume and sales growth. And importantly, as we indicated in our press release, we're on track to deliver solid sales and earnings growth for the full fiscal year. Now, turning to our financial results for the third quarter, third quarter sales grew 4% reflecting 7 points of volume growth, including nearly 3 points of volume contribution from the Renew Life acquisition and 1 point of benefit from pricing in International, mainly in Argentina. These factors were partially offset by nearly 3 points of unfavorable mix and over 1 point of higher trade promotion investment to support our innovation programs. Gross margin came in at 44%, a decrease of 130 basis points, compared to a 210-basis point increase in the year-ago quarter. As always, we provide details on our gross margin drivers in a supplemental schedule that's a part of our earnings release. What I'll focus on now is our perspective on third quarter results, and what we're anticipating for the full year. Third quarter gross margin was lower than anticipated, primarily from the impact of negative mix in our Charcoal business and strong performance in the club channel across multiple businesses. All other assumptions for third quarter gross margin played out as we anticipated. Turning to the full year, we anticipate fiscal year gross margin to decrease modestly, reflecting ongoing inflationary pressures, firming commodity prices, unfavorable mix, and negative foreign currencies. In addition, fiscal year gross margin reflects higher trade investments to support product innovation. These factors are expected to be partially offset by the benefit of cost savings and pricing. Longer-term, improving gross margin continues to be a priority, and we certainly feel good about our strong track record of delivering meaningful cost savings year-after-year. We have pricing power from leading brands, and we'll continue to invest in the more profitable businesses in our portfolio. At 13.6% of sales, selling and administrative expenses were lower than the year-ago period, and we continue to anticipate fiscal year expenses to come in below 14% of sales. Advertising and sales promotion spending was up $15 million with total spend nearly 11% of sales, reflecting continued strong support for our U.S. business and select growth opportunities in International. Our effective tax rate was 30% versus 33% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.31, an 8% increase versus year-ago, this on top of 12% growth in the year-ago quarter. Turning to net cash provided by continuing operations, year-to-date cash flow came in at $483 million, an increase of nearly 11% versus the year-ago period. Now, on to our fiscal year 2017 outlook, we continue to anticipate fiscal year sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%, reflecting solid sales results to-date and the strength of our innovation program. Our updated sales outlook also reflects about one point of negative impact from foreign currencies with most of the impact having occurred in the first half of the fiscal year. We continue to expect the advertising and sales promotion spending to be about 10% of sales, and we anticipate fiscal year EBIT margin to increase roughly 25 basis points from lower selling and administrative expenses. In addition, as previously communicated, we'll be lapping a number of items in the fourth quarter, including integration costs related to the Renew Life acquisition, the negative mix effect from distribution expansion of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes in the Club channel, and a return to more normal levels of performance-based incentive compensation costs. As we move through the balance of the year, we'll also be closely monitoring how the charcoal season unfolds. Turning to our fiscal year tax rate, we continue to anticipate our fiscal year tax rate to be between 32% and 33%, and, as previously communicated, we continue to expect ongoing variability in our quarterly and annual tax rates. Net of all of these factors, our fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $5.25 to $5.35, an increase of 7% to 9%. As we look beyond fiscal year 2017, we'll continue executing our strategy in what remains a very challenging operating environment. First, recognizing the high level of competition in several U.S. categories and the intensifying competitive dynamics in retail, we'll continue to invest behind our brands to support our categories and maintain the help of our core business. Next, in light of continued, slowing international economies, executing our Go Lean strategy remains a priority with an emphasis on long-term margin improvement through productivity gains and select margin-accretive growth initiatives. And finally, as we previously communicated, commodity prices are increasing and inflation will remain for the foreseeable future. We'll continue to maintain a healthy cost-savings pipeline, invest in more profitable businesses in our portfolio, focus on lowering SG&A costs as a percentage of sales, and take pricing as needed to protect our margins. In closing, we feel good about our results in the third quarter, and we're on track to deliver solid sales and earnings growth for the full fiscal year. Importantly, we believe that strong execution against our strategy and a sharp focus on what we can control will help us continue creating solid shareholder value over the long-term. Now I'll turn it over to Benno. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Thank you, Steve, and hello, everyone, on this 104th birthday of The Clorox Company. As I round out our prepared remarks, there are three things I want to share with you today. First, we're pleased to have delivered continued strong volume and sales growth this quarter in an environment where growth is so hard to achieve. This was our fourth consecutive quarter with 7% or greater volume growth. Our focus is first and foremost on the health of our core business by offering superior value to consumers behind strong brand investments and innovation. And the robust innovation we launched in the first half continued to be a key driver of volume and sales growth in Q3 with several new products off to a strong start, including Clorox Scentiva wipes and sprays and Brita Stream pitchers. And with marketing support now turned on for most of our new products including Hidden Valley Simply Ranch and Kingsford Long-Burning Charcoal, we feel good about the outlook for innovation in our fourth quarter as well. We also continue to feel good about Renew Life, which contributed two points to sales growth this quarter. Yesterday marked the one-year anniversary of the acquisition of this business, and I'd like to take a moment to recognize all the people across our company who have made the integration of this business so smooth and successful and who are driving distribution and market share. In Q3, our International business also continued the upward trend we started to see in Q2. We delivered another quarter of strong profit growth with our Go Lean strategy behind price increases and cost savings which include the sales of a distribution facility as our team continues to focus on improving profitability. The next point I want to emphasize is that we continue to have confidence in our strategy, which gives us quite a bit of resilience in what remains a difficult environment. Here are a few examples; it has been widely discussed that to attract consumers, retailers have become very competitive, focusing on price and value for their shoppers. And as a result, what we're seeing from a category standpoint is that dollar and volume growth have been roughly the same in recent periods. And this clearly is a change from the last few years where price increases in our categories resulted in dollar growth exceeding volume growth. Importantly, however, it's our view that consumers are not buying fewer items. They're just buying at lower price points. And fundamentally, we believe our categories are healthy. From a Clorox standpoint, we therefore plan to stay the course with our strategy to invest in brand building behind superior products and innovation with the intent to deliver better value for consumers and to spur category growth for our retail customers. It's also important to note while our focus on traditional retailers remains very important to us, we're seeing very strong gains in our on-track channels such as with some of our institutional health care, Burt's Bees lines, and Renew Life probiotics lines and in some of our on-track channels such as Club, Home Hardware, Pet Specialty, and eCommerce. And regarding eCommerce, technology continues to transform the way consumers shop our categories and we believe that our focus on leading this technology transformation will continue to be a competitive advantage for the company. Case in point, eCommerce sales are up 30% fiscal year-to-date and our digital marketing investments continue to deliver strong ROIs. In addition, our strategy helps us weather macro impacts over time, such as rising commodity costs which, as noted last quarter, are now becoming more of a headwind. In response, we'll continue to lean into cost savings, SG&A productivity programs, and the more profitable parts of our portfolio to support our margins. All that said, my third point is that we remain confident we can continue to create solid shareholder value over the long-term. We remain committed to maintaining strong brand building investments as we continue driving household penetration, engaging with consumers in provocative and captivating new ways, and launching consumer preferred innovation across the portfolio. We'll continue to drive our business with core customers and in eCommerce channels supported with strong digital marketing execution. We'll continue leading into our Renew Life acquisition to capitalize on distribution expansion opportunities in the fast-growing digestive health category. And we'll also continue to drive cost savings and productivity programs in the U.S. and in International and we'll also leverage our pricing power where appropriate over the long-term. So in this challenging environment, I remain confident in our strategy. And with that, we'll open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Dorer. We'll go to Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Thanks for the question. Good afternoon, guys. First question, Benno, just on the guidance for the year, organic sales growth now. So it looks like the midpoint of your guidance implies about 2.5% growth at the midpoint, but given about 3.5% year-to-date, it would seem to suggest a deceleration about half a point of growth in the fourth quarter. So, if you could just confirm that and some of the drivers behind it? And then related to it, of course, there's been a lot of discussion, some of which you touched on, with some of the weakness that we're seeing in the U.S. in a difficult retail environment. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in April? The Nielsen data we're looking at suggests that industry growth for you has gotten a little bit better but still negative, so maybe you could comment a little bit on what you're seeing so far quarter-to-date? And then what's implied in your guidance for industry growth here for the balance of the year. Thanks. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Kevin, this is Steve. Let me start off. You've got a couple of questions there. First, in terms of our sales outlook for the year, as we said in the press release and our opening comments, we anticipate 3% to 4% sales growth for the full fiscal year. And I'm certainly very pleased that we're at the upper end of that fiscal year-to-date. I think as you look to the fourth quarter, a couple things I would point out. Number one is we're going to begin the process of lapping the acquisition of the Renew Life business. That, for the full-year, is expected to deliver about two points of incremental sales growth for the company. But again, we'll start lapping that as we go into the fourth quarter. We're also going to start lapping the expansion of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes into a major club store customer in the fourth quarter. So I think on balance, when you run the math, we'll see where we come out. But it's possible as we start to anniversary that, the growth could be a bit lower in the fourth quarter just because we're anniversarying some of those items. I'll let Benno take your next question. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yes. So on categories, look, in Q3, our U.S. business was up 9% in volume. And that's, I would say, puts us, you know, in a position to be well positioned relative to our competitors. Shares are steady. Volumes in our categories are steady and, frankly growing, so the categories remain quite healthy. And I would call our business in the U.S. on track. What we're watching per our introductory remarks is category value as consumers migrate towards more value and as retailers compete with each other more based on pricing. And that's something that we're certainly focused on, and we're also focused on non-track channels. A lot of the growth right now comes from non-track channels and that business, frankly, is very healthy as we think about eCommerce, as we think about club, home hardware, the institutional channel, dollar, new channels, convenience stores, others. We feel like we have a tremendous amount of growth opportunity in non-track channels that we're taking advantage of. So I would call our categories quite healthy and, frankly, resilient. What we need to make sure is that the volume growth that we're seeing in our category continues to translate into strong dollar growth and we're doing that by investing in the more profitable parts of the portfolio and the higher dollar ring parts of the portfolio, which includes innovation, and we're doing that by maintaining the strong brand investments that we have started to put in about two years ago. So all-in-all, I would say in a very difficult environment, the business remains on track, and the categories are, frankly, quite steady. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Thanks, Kevin. Operator : We'll go next to Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Just following up on that, I mean, you guys obviously continue to drive strong volume growth, but it is coming now with the help of even more in price promo mix. So I guess two questions. First, is it really driving any incremental consumption by consumers or any new consumers into the category? Not just for you, but also for the category as you think about the retail, the pressures from retail? And is there any concern that all this promo is really just pushing consumers to stock up more and that it'll come to sort of hurt later on? And then, second, what happens now that raw material prices are going up? How do you think that's going to impact promotional levels for both you and your competitors? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yes, thanks Olivia. A lot packed into those questions. So first thing, what we said is that price, our trade promotion dollars which clearly have been tracking up in line with what we've communicated in the past, they're going after two things. First of all, there are a selected number of categories where we are responding to an increase in competition, and I would say Wipes and Glad trash are two examples where we're responding in kind to make sure that our categories and our business remains healthy long-term. We've also said that we're not afraid to do that even if it hurts the profitability of one quarter because we're putting these spending plans in place with an eye on the long-term health and profitability of the business and we continue to do that. That's something that we're doing quite well. The big buckets of where our trade promotion dollars go is innovation, and we've also said in the past and continue to believe that these are strategic investments that build our brand equity because they increase speed to shelf and because they get these innovations off the ground. As you know well, we have a lot of innovation and an environment that is clearly innovation starved, and we're leveraging that. And as a result, several of the innovations, as we've indicated in our introductory remarks, like Clorox Scentiva, like Brita Stream, like Kingsford long-burning charcoal, like also the Clorox Fuzion in the institutional channel are doing really, really well. And that, of course, bodes well in the long run. To your question as to whether this will have a long-term positive impact, beyond the innovation that it helps, I would ask that we perhaps look at household penetration. As you know, we're very much focused on driving household penetration. We have grown household penetration on our brands once again last quarter. We now have 80% of our sales either growing or with stable household penetration in an environment where many brands are losing household penetration. A lot of our brands are growing household penetration, and a percentage of our sales that's growing household penetration is 2x of the percentage of sales that was growing household penetration three years ago. So what that tells you is that this trade promotion spend, as part of our total spending plan, is leading to access to more consumers, and that in the long run is the best way to grow brands profitably. On the raw materials front, no news, really. I would say commodities have become more of a headwind, and what we've said in the past is that we would expect that the promotional environment would ease up over time. We still expect that, but there's a time lag, Olivia, and I think that'll take a few quarters. We expect that to continue to be elevated for a while, but if history repeats itself, which it has over the years, then we can expect that to become better in the mid- and long-term. Encouragingly, though, even though we're losing some share in Glad trash which is most affected by this, which is a calculated move on our side, we continue to be encouraged by the fact that the premium end of the business with OdorShield, where the heart of our strategy is because that's where the profit pool is, is continuing to be doing quite well and is actually growing. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Appreciate the color, Benno. Just one follow-up. I noticed on your price sheet that there's no raw materials-related pricing plans yet. Is it just not enough yet to warrant a move? Or is that just a function of all the factors within the environment that we're talking about right now? Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: I think it's just very early, Olivia. Keep in mind, we've been enjoying tailwinds for actually a couple of years now and we just started to see the headwind in this quarter, and I think what we'll need to see is sustained increases in raw material pricings for some period of time at a level that's high enough to justify pricing. So I think this will take a couple of quarters to see if the trend continues to play out this way. I think what's important to note, though, is we've got leading brands. They're very strong. So as we've experienced before, if, in fact, we start to experience a real margin squeeze associated with this, we're not afraid to take pricing. It sometimes means we lose a little volume in the short term; it tends to come back, but we're not afraid to take pricing to protect the margins, but this is the first quarter of headwind, so I think we need a few more quarters to see how this plays out. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : And we'll go next to Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Hi, everyone. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Hey, Bonnie Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I had a follow up to some of the commentary around the club-channel. How should we think about gross margins as you start to lap some of the distribution gains there? And then, separately, can you give us a sense as to how your new Scentiva products are impacting your gross margins? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: So maybe the Scentiva first. The large majority of our innovation is margin accretive to their categories, and we should be thinking about Scentiva as one of the products that falls into that camp, and, as we've noted, that's off to a really nice start both in wipes as well as in sprays, and we're pretty bullish about this being a future innovation platform. Now, the club business, what we've noted is somewhat of a trade-off. Some margins generally are a bit lower than our average margins, but it's better to be in club than club shoppers buying your competitors in that channel, and being the only game in town on wipes in club has certainly been a very good initiative for us that's importantly been instrumental in the wipes business, gaining access to full points of incremental households over the last year since we started being back in club. So feeling good about being in club, but we have now, in Q4, fully lapped that distribution and certainly what Steve had noted is that the club business, the particular strength that we've had, in particular, also driven by wipes, has been somewhat of a headwind for us margin-wise, and we have now fully anniversaried that, and that's certainly something to take into account as we think about margins for our business going forward. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for that. And then I was hoping to get a little more color on your trade promo spending that pressured your gross margins in the quarter. How much of the increase is due to investment behind innovation versus in response to competitive pressure? And then curious, how much pressure are you guys getting from retailers to possibly share in some of the price investments that they've been making? And, I guess, I'm getting the sense that this must be intensifying. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: The split question first, Bonnie. I don't know that we break that out for you, but, like we've said earlier and like we said in the past, it's a mix. More broadly speaking, our focus is on supporting our innovations, and I would like to remind everybody that trade promotion doesn't necessarily mean pricing. It can go into displays and other value-added activities, which is certainly our focus, but then there are a few categories, and we've in the past noted wipes, Glad trash, and also cat litter, which is doing really well, where the competition is quite intense, and where we're responding in kind to some of our competitors' activities. So I would say it's a mix. On the pricing activity that you mentioned, we have a fair and equitable pricing policy, which means that all retailers qualify for the same pricing, and we do not favor any retailer, big or small, on that. So if retailers choose to make price investments on our brands, we are not supporting that because, again, we're handling our business with a long-term eye on profitability, we'll treat all customers fair and equitably, and we also know that most of our brands don't see an increase in consumption if pricing is lower so we're certainly focused on protecting the pricing integrity of our business and because we're category managers for most of our categories with most retailers and we're advising retailers on their strategies on how to grow our categories profitably, that's certainly a component that we're very focused on and that we're stressing in all our conversations that we have with retailers. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon. I just want to \u2013 and I'm sorry to go back to the same questions that we are all asking. I mean, in terms of your top-line growth, which obviously was quite impressive in this competitive environment. But \u2013 so could you help us bridge the kind of channel neutral, if you will, of this promotion, let's say? Or is it mostly because you've gained distribution? So you've got all this volume and you've gained distribution not only at Costco or online or more shelf space in some of the categories where you're gaining market share? Or you have more innovation? So I was just trying to see on a same-shelf-space basis or a same-door basis, how much more spending are you incrementally having in promotions? So how much of that is \u2013 or are you seeing that coming off of a quarter and you're seeing that intensifying, going back to Bonnie's question, as you go into a more difficult environment? Thank you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: So, Andrea, I mean, clearly if you think about the \u2013 let's talk volume growth. So a lot of the volume growth clearly is in non-tracked (40:02) channels, but that's because consumers are increasingly buying in non-tracked (40:06) channels. And we realize you guys don't see that, but what it speaks to is the strength of our business in those channels and that's not by happenstance but that's because we're investing in innovation, we're investing in assortments and we're following the consumer. If you think about where the growth is, it's in eCommerce. eCommerce fiscal year-to-date is up 30%. If you think about where the growth is, it's in club because consumers migrate towards club. Why? Because club offers better value and we're driving a lot of growth because we have strong brands. Home hardware is the same. If you look at the home hardware channel as is well publicized, it's doing really well, and we're investing, and that's delivering strong returns. If you think about Professional Products, which again is up 7% off of 17% in the year-ago quarter, we're investing in that channel. The dollar channel, if you think about what we said in the past about our focus on $1 SKUs which we have launched last year and which are contributing about 0.5 point of growth to our company, that speaks to the consumer trend of affordability which we're addressing very, very well. So we are focused on driving our categories and our brands the right way and with a long-term view. And as a result, we're driving growth in those channels through certainly strong investments in things that drive our brand equities in expansion of assortment, in innovation, and in overall health of both new SKUs as well as existing SKUs, but the right way and with the long-term view. So that is what's happening here, and that's what's driving the growth that we've had. You've noted that we have growth in an environment where few companies do, and that is deliberate and based on strategy. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : No, that's helpful, Benno. But just on the existing, let's say, the Walmarts, the FDM, you're still \u2013 you're not worried about like the level of inventory. You don't see that they're overstocked relative to the consumer take-away. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: First of all, always worry about Walmart. They're 26% of our business, so we always focused on making sure that that business is healthy, which it is. And frankly it's been healthy for a long time and we feel good about that. Why is it healthy? Because we're doing exactly what I just said. We're investing with them in activities that drive category growth, and we're keeping our value sharp on our brands through innovation and brand building, and we're rewarded by Walmart for that. Walmart's very good at operations, of course, and very good at managing their inventory. A lot of it is done electronically, so we have not seen an uptick in inventories. We have not seen anything unusual there. So our business with Walmart and other customers is pretty sound, and we're working with them to keep it that way. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Perfect, Benno. Thank you very much, and congrats. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Thanks, Andrea. Operator : We'll go to Ali Dibadj of Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. A few questions. One back on gross margin, clearly, a little bit weaker. You've talked through commodities, manufacturing, logistics, as well as mix now and, of course, trade spend. And if you take gross margin and you correlate it to your stock price, it actually ties very much to your stock price, at least historically it has. So if your gross margin goes down, your stock does as well. So what's your outlook on each of these dimensions, especially on the mix and trade spend drivers of gross margin? Because it certainly sounds from discussion set (43:51) that the ability to take price will be a little bit more curtailed going forward. So if you can talk about, particularly, around mix and trade spend which you do have an eye into, that would be helpful. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: So, Ali, as you know, in August of every year, we provide our outlook, and we'll certainly do that this year and provide you an outlook for fiscal 2018. I can give you some directional indicators, at least, based on what we know today about gross margin. First, I would just say that we do believe we have plans in place over the long-term to expand gross margins, not to say that you can't have variability across the quarters or even years. Of course you can. But we feel good about our plans. That said, our cost savings, we continue to feel like we've got a very healthy pipeline and we target to get 150 bps of margin expansion. That's all in. Some of that goes to gross margin, some goes to other lines, but we're feeling good about that. Pricing is an area we're keeping a sharp eye on. As you know, and as you can see in our web attachments, we've been taking pricing primarily in International, it's working. And I think you'll likely see us continue to take pricing in International and we'll have to make a determination at a future date whether pricing is \u2013 makes sense and it's cost justified in our U.S. business but certainly over the long-term with the strength of our brands, we're not afraid to take pricing if we need to. Commodity prices, as we have said for some time, I think that's going to turn into a headwind, and I think it will likely continue to be a headwind at least for the next few quarters, absent some event that we can't see, so started in the third quarter. I think you'll see it continued to be a headwind through the fourth quarter and beyond. And then I think everything else, manufacturing, logistics, you'll have some ups and downs across the quarters but you'll continue to have headwinds. As it relates to trade spending, we have \u2013 I do want to point out that we stepped that up pretty significantly in the third quarter. This was long planned. This is something we built into our plans at the beginning of the year. This is not in response to recent events. And this was really designed to do innovation. And I would also just call out that we're trying to better balance our third quarter and fourth quarter spending, so while third quarter advertising and trade spending was up significantly, and for good reason, fourth quarter, I think, you'll see those numbers come down a bit versus the year ago period. And again, that's a conscious choice on our part. So in short, feel good about the margin expansion plans. Just seeing variability across the quarters, but I think we've got good plans and we're executing well. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: And, Ali, building on this point, just putting gross margin into perspective, I think what we said, clearly, the 130 basis points versus a year ago is something that we have discussed. But versus two years ago, it's up 80 basis points. Versus three years ago, it's up 190 basis points. So hopefully that puts one quarter into perspective. As you know, we manage our business for the long-term. I would add to Steve's point on pricing that while, clearly, taking pricing in an environment like this is not easy, we do know that we still have pricing power. Pricing sensitivities are about the same as they were one year, two years, three years ago. So that feels good. And we also know that the majority of our sales enjoys a perceived value superiority by our consumers, which again speaks to the fact that we have an opportunity here should we need it down the road. And we're perceived to have superior brands because we have innovation, because we put investments in, and because we have a disciplined pricing that keeps price points sharp. So we have a toolbox to grow gross margin even in a more difficult environment, clearly. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: That's helpful. And just in terms of, kind of, related to that and the drivers of top line growth you have seen so far, clearly, it's been price and volume the past several years. As you go forward, it does seem like your ability to take price might be a little bit curtailed, given everything we've all talked about from an Aldi, from Amazon, from Walmart in terms of not just pure pricing pressure but increased private label, right, whether Aldi is successful or not, Walmart's ramping up private label. Aldi, if it is successful, will ramp up private label. Clearly, Amazon RFP'ing on private label across the board. And you guys are quite prone to that and you have been historically successful, but the price gap has no option but to expand between private label and you despite all the innovation that you're going to be doing and you have been doing. So I just wonder, from the drivers of top-line growth perspective, is price going to be an element of it going forward? And in particular, within the past year, obviously, M&A with Renew Life and distribution growth on wipes have been greater drivers than underlying growth. Are there more opportunities there that you think M&A-wise and distribution potential that could overshadow some of the past difficulties that I'm suggesting on price? Thanks, guys. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yes. A lot packed in there. I would say, I don't know that our drivers of sales growth going forward will look dramatically different than what they look like in the rearview mirror. It is innovation. Innovation is margin accretive. Innovation tends to be more at the higher end of the spectrum. It is, therefore, trade up. It is shifting the investment mix towards faster growing categories; digestive health, of course; natural personal care, the institutional channel, e-commerce. We have systematically shifted our investments towards those more profitable, faster-growing areas of the business, and those will all continue to yield results as you've taken away from our previous remarks. Our categories are quite healthy. There is a slight downward pressure on pricing, but as retailers clearly also become sharper and will compete with, or will try to inoculate themselves against discounters, what that will do is it will take categories further down, and what you need, therefore, is you need premium price market leaders, and, as you know, more than 80% of our portfolio is a premium-priced market leader, and we expect that to be frankly an opportunity for us in the marketplace. I followed discounters for 25-plus years when it all started in Germany, and what's happened is an increasing bifurcation in the marketplace. Market leaders win; private label wins; number three, four, five brands, most of them medium-priced in categories, lose their reason for being because they're trade down from premium brands and because they are trade away profit-wise from private label. So I look at that frankly as certainly something that we're watching, but mainly also an opportunity for our brands because retailers then, in the future, more than ever will need premium-priced brands, strong brands, backed by innovation to grow categories. Private label does not grow categories. So I look that as a good thing for us, and frankly, somewhat of a tailwind. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : We'll go next to Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Benno, you mentioned in your prepared remarks the strong volume growth four quarters in a row, the penetration gains. It's definitely impressive, but it's clearly coming with a pretty hefty price tag in terms of the price-mix drain. Is that just the reality we're living in today? To chase this type of growth, we're going to have to suffer that price-mix degradation? Is it something that's a bit more transitory? And why shouldn't we be concerned that that price-mix line is building as a more substantial negative at the same time, that the commodity inflation has inflected, as you point out, likely going to continue to climb from here? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yes. I mean, the best way, Jason \u2013 thanks for the question. I would answer this it that (52:14) let's keep focusing on the long-term. Any given quarter, sometimes our numbers are up, sometimes they're down, but if you look at the fiscal year, we've driven 3% to 4% sales growth, 7% to 9% earnings growth this environment. It's the third consecutive year of really solid value creation for our shareholders, and that's perhaps something I would keep in mind. What it tells you is that we are not afraid to make choices within any given quarter that allow us to profitably grow the business with the long-term eye on it, and that's all there is to it, and we're doing it the right way by focusing on the ROI on our spending, by focusing on penetration and market share, by focusing on innovation that is margin accretive, and will provide for future growth, by focusing on driving faster-growing categories. It's disciplined, it's strategic and it's with an eye on the long-term. Is it more difficult to grow the business profitably when commodities costs are up and when retailers like to compete with each other? Yes. But I'll also tell you that our track record of competing in this environment is frankly pretty formidable, and if you look at the financial crisis or other situations like this, again, this is not new. We have done this pretty well. And you know what? It is time for us is to activate some of the things that we've done pretty well in the past. Some of them we've talked about today. Our costs savings program continues to be very strong. Our focus on investing in the premium ends, more profitable ends of the business is working. We talked about pricing in international and should we need it over time, perhaps in the U.S. SG&A productivity. There's a lot of things that we're doing that we can continue to activate in the future so that I feel pretty confident in our ability to add value to our shareholders in a meaningful way in the long run. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful. One other way you've add some value and driven some growth is through some pretty smart acquisitions in the last couple of years, or at least they seem to have been. As you think about the pipeline out there, the market environment, are there opportunities out there that you see to go out and buy more? Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Hi, Jason. This is Steve. I would say, we're always looking at our pipeline, and it still remains more of a seller's market than a buyer's market, but we're actively looking at lots of different opportunities in different spaces. But our number one priority will continue to be driving organic growth, healthy growth on our base business. But to the extent that we can find, not just good businesses, but good deals at attractive prices, we certainly have plenty of cash flow and available resources to be able to execute on it. But it's pretty hard to plan for that. So we work it all the time, but our number one priority is to keep driving hard against our base business and keep that innovation pipeline healthy. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Very good. Thank you, guys. Steven Austenfeld - The Clorox Co.: Thanks, Jason. Operator : We'll go next to Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thanks very much. Benno, you made a comment earlier in the call about you're a one-price company. I know there's some relevant rules and legislation about that that everybody has to follow, but I know you're also free to set certain volume or dollar-level incentives for sizes of the shipments or whatever that functionally give some customers, everybody to get the opportunity to do a lot of volume, but functionally, give some customers have a better chance of getting to those volume incentives than others. I guess my questions are, are you saying that Clorox doesn't work that way? That in fact your volume \u2013 you'll offer the same levels of price that (56:16) will offer those incentives at different levels? And does maybe trying to \u2013 does it ever happen that trying to work with the needs of one retailer, as far as volume incentives and shipments, lead to unintended consequences across other areas? And my second question is just about e-commerce. Is your share in e-commerce approximately the same as your share offline in the categories where you do participate? And can you give us a sense how big that is of your business? I didn't hear that before. Thank you very much. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yes. Thanks, Jonathan. So, first of all on a pricing policy, we do not comment on specifics on the price policy and certainly not on specific conversations that we have with retailers. All I can do is reiterate that our pricing policy is fair and equitable, and all customers have the ability to qualify for the same pricing. On e-commerce, we don't have good and reliable share data, I will say, so the industry is still working on that. What we do know is that the business is up 30% fiscal year to date. In Q3, for instance, the business with our largest customer in e-commerce is up 75%, which tells you that trends are quite healthy. And for the first time, e-commerce now is north of 3% of sales in our company. What we have said is that we would like this business to be $300 million in size by the year 2020, and we're frankly slightly ahead of that and working towards upsides against that goal. So feeling good about e-commerce. Why? Because our capabilities that we have translate very well, because we have leading brands that matter to consumers in the e-commerce space and because we have, frankly, started talking about e-commerce years ago when this wasn't a hot topic in our industry just yet. So we feel like we've built a competitive advantage that we're putting to work now. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : And we'll go next to Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Hi. Thank you. So I just had two questions. One is on Burt's Bees. So I know the business declined because of the prior-year comp, but can you talk about the consumer take-away trends in that business? And then secondly, I just wanted to ask about the other income. So I know there's $10 million from the gain on sale that you had talked about. What's the incremental $6 million? Thank you. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: So, Faiza, let me take the second part of your question first. So for other income and expense, as you can see, it's a pretty large change. The biggest driver is what we communicated in the previous earnings call, which is we sold a piece of real estate in Australia as a part of our Go Lean operations in International, where we're trying to not just build margins and improve productivity, but take a little bit more of a go asset-light model. So that threw off again a little bit more than $10 million. The rest is a lot of puts and takes, just a lot of small items that collectively add up to a number. So there's not much more to it than that. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yes, and on Burt's Bees, Faiza, welcome. We have in Q3 lapped the lip-color launch a year ago, which was a particularly big innovation that we launched in Q3. So we went up against not only double-digit volume growth in Q3 of last fiscal year, but also double-digit volume growth in Q2 of fiscal year 2017. So the reality is we're beginning to lap tougher quarters, double-digits growth quarters, but the reality also is that we continue to feel very good about this business. We're continuing to grow market share. The core lip business displayed record-high shipments in Q3. We're supporting innovation with advertising in Q4. And importantly, we're going to launch significant innovation later in this calendar year. So the way to think about it is that our innovation timing this year is different from the innovation timing last year and what that will lead to, and clearly has in Q3, is unevenness quarter-by-quarter versus year-ago. But in the long run, we feel good about this business. It's on trend. The brand is doing well. And as you know, we, in part, also like this business because it's a nice margin trade-up for the company Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. I just had a kind of housekeeping type question. On Charcoal, so you specifically mentioned that not just the weather but also that there was a negative mix dynamic within Charcoal this quarter, because of the lower growth of the higher-margin items in the portfolio. Is that because you weren't supporting it as much ahead of the Kingsford, the new launch that's really getting the full support in the fourth quarter? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yes, perhaps. Thanks, Lauren. Just quickly on Charcoal, sales down in Q3, right, after double-digit growth in Q2 and also in the year-ago quarter. Slower start to the grilling season, weather-related and we're certainly watching the weather also in Q4. But the comment that we made on Match Light and the higher-end product is related to merchandising. So I don't know that I would read anything strategic into that. But as there was less merchandising, as the weather was weaker in Q3, that particular part of the business was certainly affected. We've also noted that we are launching, and that was towards the end of Q3, premium priced and margin-accretive innovation with the new Charcoal that we call long-burning that burns 25% longer. And that's off to a nice start, and we're feeling good about that. So that should contribute to hopefully better results in Q4. Again, this is the main quarter for Charcoal, and it's not over until it's over, depending on the weather. But we certainly feel good about the partnership that we have with retailers on the marketing and merchandising side on this business. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then just lastly, it's interesting this is probably the one call that I've been on so far this earnings season where there wasn't a discussion of the consumer environment and where did he or she go in the first quarter of the calendar year and so on. So if you could comment on what you're seeing in terms of consumer behavior, consumer demand, because it sounds like your concern at this point is more about retailer-driven \u2013 competition in the retailers, and, thus, deflation in the categories driven by retailer competition, and maybe of what that trains the consumer to do, or pantry loading, and future impact, but less about the consumer themselves. So anything you can offer would be wonderful. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yes. That's spot on and well summarized, Lauren. Again, the best way to look at it is if you look at category volumes and you compare them versus a year ago, they're up. But they're not up more versus a year ago, which suggests that I don't see any reason to believe that there's pantry loading going on, but categories are up modestly, and they were about a year ago. So, fundamentally, the consumer hasn't stopped shopping our categories. They continue to shop our categories, but they're paying slightly less for it, and that's driven by consumer migration towards value channels, clearly, where we're doing particularly well, as it's well documented, but it's also driven by retailers and the competition and perhaps the anticipation of the discounter expansion. So that's something that we have prepared ourselves for a while, and that's why we've continued to talk about our focus on value as the core of our strategy through innovation, through brand building, through investments, through pricing, through dollar SKUs, all those things that are well documented. Those we believe are continuing to be the right ones. So that we don't see a consumer malaise, but what we need to make sure is that our consumer volume will continue to lead to consumer-dollar growth in our categories, and that's what our discussions with retailers are focused on. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's great. Thank you so much. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Thanks, Lauren. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I'd now like to turn the conference back to you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yes. Thank you, and in closing, I am pleased with our continued top-line momentum and strong earnings growth this quarter, and we're certainly on track to deliver solid sales and earnings growth for the fiscal year. Our Strategy 2020 continues to work, and we believe it remains the right one for Clorox to create value for shareholders over the long run. We look forward to speaking with all of you, again, in August when we share our fourth quarter and year-end results and our outlook for fiscal year 2018. So thank you, and have a good day, everyone. Operator : And, again, that does conclude our call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

LLC Shannon Coyne - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc. Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Clorox Company Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Steve Robb, Chief Financial Officer for The Clorox Company. Mr. Robb, you may begin your conference. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Thank you, and hello, everyone. Before we start with our prepared remarks, I wanted to acknowledge Lisah Burhan's participation on the call. As you may recall, Lisah had previously worked in Investor Relations and is now back and we're very pleased we're going to be able to expand the team with Lisah taking on several responsibilities including the quarterly earnings calls. She has worked in every one of our business segments and will be a great addition to our team. Steve Austenfeld, who you have known for years, will continue to be a leader in Investor Relations. And going forward, you'll continue to see both Lisah and Steve at investor meetings, conferences and at our next Analyst Meeting on October 5 in New York. The flow of the call will be the same as in the past. Lisah will cover performance by segment, I'll address our financial results and outlook, and finally, Benno will close with his perspective before we open it up to your questions. With that, I will turn it over to Lisah to cover our segment results. Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.: Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'm glad to be back in IR and I certainly look forward to working with all of you in the future. But before we jump into results, let's remind you of a few things. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com. On today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliations with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks, or supplemental information available on our website as well as in our SEC filings. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release. Please also recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. With that, I'll cover results. For the total company, fourth quarter volume and sales grew 3%, with sales growing all across all segments. Our sales in the track channels remain healthy. We continue to see particularly strong growth in non-track channels including growth in e-Commerce, Home Hardware and Club. Turning to results by segment; in Cleaning, Q4 volume grew 4% and sales increased 2%. Cleaning segment topline was driven by Home Care behind record quarterly shipments of Clorox disinfecting wipes, early successes of new Scentiva wipes and sprays, as well as broad-based strength across the Clorox equity portfolio. We are especially pleased with the growth of our wipes business this quarter, given we have fully lapped last year's distribution gain in the Club channel. Overall, Home Care delivered a third consecutive year of very strong market share growth, hitting 20% on a 52-week basis, its highest share in six years. Our Professional Products business volume increased, although sales were flat following double-digit sales growth in the year ago quarter. Volume gains were broad-based with contributions from a number of recent innovations in the surface disinfecting space. Lastly, within our Cleaning segment, laundry sales and volume declined, primarily due to category softness. Positively, however, we continue to grow our premium Clorox Splash-less Bleach resulting in share gains on total Clorox liquid bleach. Turning to Household segment; fourth quarter volume increased 5% and sales grew 4%, reflecting strong topline growth in Renew Life, Cat Litter and Glad. Starting with Cat Litter; sales grew double-digits behind innovation and strong merchandising support. This also was the third consecutive quarter of market share growth for litter supported by our prior launch of Fresh Step with Febreze. Our Glad bags and wraps business saw solid topline growth behind ongoing success from our premium OdorShield trash bags, particularly in the Club channel, which more than offset the decline on our base business. Although overall track channel market share for Glad was down in the quarter, we continue to see \u2013 we continue to gain share consistent with our strategy in the higher-margin premium trash bag segment and our OdorShield trash bag delivered all-time record volume in fiscal year 2017. In addition, we continue to see strong growth in non-track channels, including Club, Home Hardware, and notably, e-Commerce. Fourth quarter non-trackable shipments were flat, in line with our expectations. We continue to feel good about our plans for this business going forward and the category is on track. Finally, we remain excited about Renew Life. Our distribution expansion plans remain on track with gains in the Food/Drug/Mass channel and behind dual placement strategies at key accounts as well as very strong growth in e-Commerce. We will continue to focus on expanding distribution in fiscal year 2018. And we've begun supporting this business with a new national marketing campaign. Turning to Lifestyle; volume declined 1% and sales grew 2%. Burt's Bees delivered solid topline growth this quarter on top of double-digit topline growth in the year ago quarter. The business also drove share gains behind incremental distribution and merchandising activities in lip care. We have a strong innovation lineup for fiscal year 2018 with some of these items already on shelve. In our Food business, volume declined slightly due to lower shipments of KC Masterpiece barbecue sauces. That said, consumption and shares in our key segments remain healthy and we are especially pleased that our Hidden Valley equity delivered a tenth consecutive quarter of share growth. To wrap up the Lifestyle segment, Brita sales were flat in Q4 as gains from innovation behind our Stream pitcher were offset primarily by strong competitive activities and a strategic choice to rationalize a lower margin part of our portfolio. Finally, turning to International, volume and sales were up in Q4 despite more than 3 points of FX headwinds, and slower category growth in countries like Argentina and Peru due to macroeconomic trends. We continue to take pricing to offset unfavorable foreign exchange as part of our larger effort to improve margin. Now I'll turn it over to Steve, to provide more details on our fiscal 2017 performance as well as outlook for fiscal year 2018. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Thanks, Lisah. And we are certainly very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter and fiscal year. We're performing well in a challenging environment, delivering strong sales and earnings growth while generating healthy cash flows. Turning to our financial results for the fourth quarter, Q4 sales grew 3%, reflecting 3 points of volume growth, which included about 1 point of benefit from the Renew Life acquisition and about 1 point of pricing, primarily in International. These factors were partially offset by about 1 point of unfavorable mix. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 45.7%, an increase of 30 basis points, and was our highest quarterly gross margin in eight years. Contributing to the gross margin expansion were 150 basis points of cost savings and 50 basis points of pricing. These factors were partially offset by 130 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs from continued inflation, and about 90 basis points of unfavorable commodity costs consistent with the rising trends we've previously communicated. Fourth quarter gross margin also reflected 50 basis points of benefit from lapping one-time integration costs related to the Renew Life acquisition. Selling and administrative expenses came in as expected at 12.9% of sales, compared to 14.1% in the year-ago quarter, largely driven by lower incentive compensation costs and productivity gains. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels for the quarter remained healthy at about 11% of sales, compared to 12% of sales in the year-ago quarter when we made particularly strong investments to support our brands and drive trial behind our innovation programs. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate came in at 31.7% versus 34.3% in the year-ago quarter and included excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Now net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.53, an increase of 21%. Now, I'll turn to our results for the full-fiscal year. Sales grew 4%, reflecting 6 points of volume growth, which included about 3 points of incremental sales growth from our innovation programs, about 2 points of benefit from the Renew Life acquisition, and 1 point of pricing benefit, primarily in International. These factors were partially offset by nearly 2 points of negative mix and about 1 point of currency headwinds. Gross margin for the fiscal year decreased 40 basis points to 44.7% compared to 45.1% in fiscal 2016 when gross margins increased significantly at 150 basis points. Our fiscal year gross margin results reflected 150 basis points of cost savings and 60 basis points of pricing, which were more than offset by 170 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs and 60 basis points of negative mix. Selling and administrative expenses for the full fiscal year came in at 13.6% of sales, in line with our expectations and consistent with our long-term goal to be less than 14% of sales. Advertising spending as a percentage of sales for fiscal year 2017 came in at a healthy 10% of sales. And for the full fiscal year, our effective tax rate was 31.9%. Net of all of these factors, our fiscal year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $5.35 compared with $4.92 in the year-ago period, an increase of 9%. This, on top of an 8% increase in fiscal year 2016. Turning to cash flow for the fiscal year. Net cash provided by continuing operations came in strongly at $871 million versus $768 million in the prior year, an increase of 13%. We're real pleased with our track record of generating healthy cash flows. This allows us to reinvest in our business with a focus on keeping our core healthy. What's also important, this allows us to return excess cash to shareholders. And we're particularly proud that for 40 consecutive years, we've been able to increase our dividend. At the end of fiscal year 2017, our debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.7, which gives us the financial flexibility to continue investing in growth and meeting our capital allocation goals. Now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2018 outlook. As we mentioned in our press release, we anticipate sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%. As always, this reflects a number of assumptions, including about 3 points of incremental sales growth from new products, approximately 1 point of pricing and about 1 point of negative impact from foreign currencies which remain volatile. Turning to margin. We anticipate gross margin to be up slightly, reflecting the benefits of cost savings and price increases partially offset by ongoing inflationary pressures as well as higher commodity costs. Importantly, based on our assumptions for gross margin as well as improvements across other P&L line items, we anticipate fiscal year 2018 EBIT margin to expand modestly. Now for our fiscal year tax rate. We expect our fiscal year effective tax rate to be between 32% and 33%. As previously communicated, we continue to anticipate variability in our quarterly and annual tax rates, given the inherent uncertainty of share-based transactions. Net of all of these factors, we anticipate fiscal year 2018 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.52 to $5.72, an increase of 3% to 7%. While it's still early in the fiscal year, I'd like to highlight a few significant trends we're actively working to address. First, we're operating in a more competitive environment. We're experiencing it in key categories, such as trash bags and litter. And the competitive dynamics in retail remain elevated. Second, we continue to be pressured by rising commodity costs and ongoing inflation. And finally, we're continuing to face challenging economic conditions within International, including a more difficult pricing environment and a longer recovery period in Argentina. Consistent with our 2020 strategy, we're responding to these challenges by continuing to invest strongly in product and brand differentiation to keep our value proposition sharp. We're leaning into our cost savings pipeline and our productivity initiatives to support our margins. And finally, executing our Go Lean strategy in International, which emphasizes improving margins through operational efficiencies. In closing, we're very pleased with the strong finish to fiscal year 2017. We're making the right strategic choices to support the health of our business and to continue delivering long-term value creations for our shareholders. And, with that, I will turn it over to Benno. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Thank you, Steve, and hello, everyone. There are three things I want you to take away from this call. First, I'm particularly proud of the more than 8,000 Clorox people around the world for delivering yet another year of strong year-over-year financial results in fiscal 2017. We delivered sales growth in every quarter of the fiscal year, which is not common in an environment where growth is so hard to come by. Growth was broad-based, as we grew volume at 24 of our top 30, or 80% of our U.S. retail customers. And while our focus on traditional retailers remains core, we are seeing strong progress in e-Commerce, where sales are up ahead of our objectives at more than 30% for the fiscal year, having accelerated into the fourth quarter. While gross margin declined modestly for the year, notably off a very strong year-ago increase, in Q4 we had our highest gross margin in eight years, driven by very strong cost savings and the beginning of a turnaround in International. And we delivered 9% diluted EPS growth and, in what is a hallmark for Clorox, we delivered another year of strong free cash flow at about 11% of sales. Second, we continue to focus on consumer value to differentiate our products and brands in an environment where value remains king. We made great progress against what we call the Clorox Value Measure, or CVM, which reflects a combination of product performance, price and the consumers' perception of our brands. In fiscal year 2017, based on CVM, the majority of our brands are seen as superior by consumers, and this is because we place such strong emphasis on innovation, staying tight on our price gaps and continuing to invest heavily in brands that consumers love. We continue to see strong returns on our demand creation investments, which we focus disproportionately on our profitable growth brands. In line with our strategy, digital marketing expanded from 41% to 45% of our media spending in fiscal year 2017, and we invested a healthy 10% of sales in advertising overall. And we had another strong year of innovation, delivering about 3 points of incremental sales to the top line. Third, we have a strategy that continues to work, which gives me confidence, even in the face of what we anticipate will be a more competitive retail environment. As retailers increasingly compete based on value and competition in categories like trash bags and cat litter remains elevated, we'll continue to keep our price value sharp and to continue to invest in brand building and innovation. We'll stay focused on margin enhancement in the U.S. and International as we aim to extend our track record of delivering 10 consecutive years of cost savings at $100 million or more and lean into the more profitable parts of our portfolio. And we remain committed to our overall strategy. And we'll share more with you in October at Analyst Day about how we're staying agile on our priorities and operating plans in the face of this challenging and ever-changing environment. So in summary, remaining committed to our 2020 strategy means we remain committed to you, our shareholders, and creating value for you by staying the course while making the adjustments necessary to continue to deliver good growth. And that's growth that's possible, sustainable, and responsible. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, everyone. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Good morning, Bonnie. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Morning. My question, my first one is on cost savings. I was hoping you guys could just give us a sense as to whether you still think 2% of your total addressable spending is a reasonable cost savings target? I guess also in looking at FY 2018, should we expect this to be more heavily-weighted towards COGS-related savings or more towards SG&A-related savings? And then finally, how should we expect this to ramp over the course of the year? Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Bonnie, this is Steve. Let me take that question. So a couple of thoughts about the cost savings program. We always target to get 2 points of productivity out of all of the addressable spend. I would actually tell you that we've been doing quite a bit better than that over the last couple of years. We've been getting about 150 bps of margin expansion. Now, that's across all lines of the P&L. And I think just based on the health of the cost savings pipeline that we have, importantly, as you probably heard us on recent calls talk about stepping up our level of investment behind cost savings, I think we feel very confident that we can continue to deliver healthy cost savings well into the future and our goal for fiscal 2018 would be to deliver something in the area of 150 bps of margin expansion from those cost savings programs. You're going to have some variability across quarters, but I would say you should expect healthy cost savings in each of the quarters as we move through the year. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then in terms of your SG&A, it was 12.9% of sales in the quarter, and I guess that was a little bit lower than what we were expecting, so I'm wondering if there was any pull forward in savings that might have helped you guys meet this objective for the year that now might limit how much SG&A savings you can achieve in FY 2018. And then along those same lines, you're again guiding to SG&A at less than the 14% of net sales, so does that imply flattish SG&A or are you guys expecting to generate incremental relative savings there? Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: So just a couple of reminders. Well, first off, I was very pleased with SG&A cost coming in at 13.6% of sales for the full year. And that was very much consistent with our plans including the fourth quarter. The fact that the fourth quarter was so much lower than what you saw in the same period a year ago is a reflection of the fact that we were anniversary-ing compensation costs, which were a bit elevated last year based on the strength of our performance, both top and bottom line, but also cost savings this year. Just from a forward-looking standpoint, I think as we've said for many years, we'd like to get that below 14%. We've done that, and I think we feel good about it. I think there's more opportunity here. It is going to take time. It's not going to happen in one quarter. It's not going to happen in one year. But I do think there's an opportunity to continue to move that number down even below the number that we just experienced in fiscal 2017, although I would say the rate of decline will probably slow a little bit from here. But I think that will be an area to contribute to future margins. As it relates to margins overall for fiscal 2018, as I indicated in my opening comments, we do expect modesty EBIT margin expansion and I think a little of that will come from our gross margin. Some of that will come from just optimizing all of the other lines in the P&L and I think on balance, while there will be variability across the quarters, I think we should have another year of good margin expansion at the EBIT level. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. That was helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Hi. Thank you. So I just wanted to talk a little bit about private label and how you think things have changed. So I know you've been competing successfully with private label for a long time, but are you sensing some change, especially as you have retailers like Amazon coming on that are trying to compete in specific categories? And then are there categories where you're seeing more private label? And then how do you square the potential increase of private label with the increase in commodities at the same time? So would just love to get sort of your overall view on where you think things are going to go from here on that front. Thanks. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Yes. Thank you, Faiza. So private label, pretty stable. Let's make that the headline. As a reminder, we compete in nine major categories and in three of those nine, private label is a major competitor, so just to put it in perspective. But as you rightly said, we've competed very well in the past against private label, and we continue to do so as you look at volumes, as you look at sales, as you look at market shares. And it's been relatively stable. Certainly, there's a lot of talk about German discounters and perhaps Amazon focusing on private label, but overall, I would characterize the situation as pretty stable and for us something that we're pretty comfortable with. We're always watching private label, but if you look at it over a prolonged period of time, over the last decade, the gains that they've made are pretty modest, but we have also gained at the same time in an environment where value remains king for the consumer, and that's perhaps the reason why we've done so well. We keep our price gaps sharp, but importantly we keep our products differentiated and we invest in our brands, and as a result, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, the majority of our brands is perceived as superior versus everybody in the marketplace in their categories, and as a result, we've also been able to grow household penetration on our brands. We have gained a substantial amount of household penetration across our entire portfolio, led by the Clorox brand, and that just suggests that in an environment where certainly value, like I said, remains king, we continue to operate effectively and as long as we continue to focus on value, which is the core pillar of our strategy and perhaps the most important non-financial metric that this management team is focused on, I expect us to continue to do well. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good afternoon, folks. Thank you for let me ask a question. I guess I wanted to start with topline outlook. You have a solid year, congrats on that, but clearly, we're finishing the year with one-handles on organic sales. Your guidance implies acceleration to 3% to 5%, inflection in pricing, strong volume. It's hard to get comfortable with that in context of everything we're seeing in the industry. So help walk us through that. Maybe a bit of an outlook by segment could be helpful and some of the puts and takes that get you comfortable with the acceleration implied on the forward. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Yes. Jason, let me give you my perspective. Now recognizing we're 30 days into the fiscal year and we're pretty early in this, we think 2% to 4% is a balanced outlook. I think it's prudent outlook. It does make a couple of assumptions that I laid out at the beginning that we're comfortable with, things like getting three points of incremental sales growth from our innovation programs, which we've been doing quite successfully over the last couple of years, and equally importantly, I think we're feeling good about the innovation we launched in 2017 that should carry over to fiscal 2018. So that's one piece of the assumption. The second assumption is around pricing. Now, of course, we've been taking pricing in markets like Argentina and other countries with higher rates of inflation, but we're also going to take a hard look at pricing in targeted areas within the U.S. portfolio to the extent that commodities and inflationary pressures continue to remain elevated. So I think that's something else we're looking at. I would also just point out that while we are lapping Renew Life, it's in the base now, this is a business growing faster than the rest of our portfolio, and we would anticipate it should contribute modestly to the growth rate on a go-forward. And when you combine that with our Burt's Bees business, which has got momentum, our Litter business behind Febreze and some the other trends, we think 2% to 4% is a balanced outlook at this point, but let's get farther into the year and we'll take a look. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So that's really helpful, thank you. It sounds like a lot of it is predicated on getting price inflecting from negative to positive territory, clearly, right, since you're looking for plus one price. And at the same time, it sounds like you kind of need competitors to go along so we don't get some volumetric disruptions, some of these great penetration gains you've achieved, don't unwind the other way. Is there anything you're seeing in the market today that gives you confidence that competitors, the kind of environment will be conducive of that type of development? Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: To be clear, while we have built-in about a point of sales growth, more than half of that is likely to come from international. This is not a sales outlook that's contingent on pricing to be successful. It is contingent upon base business remaining healthy and growing, we're investing behind that. It's contingent upon continued momentum on the innovations. Those are the things I would point out. But I would also just call the pricing out because we are committed to protecting our margins, and I think there is some opportunities for targeted pricing. And importantly, we've got a very good track record of doing this and doing this well, and having the pricing stick market. But it's a smallest piece of the top line growth plan. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: And, Jason, this is Benno. Perhaps to build on Steve's remarks. The two things I would remind us all on that give us confidence that a selected look at pricing can be successful is, one, that we do pricing when it's cost justified, and of course cost increases is something that all the players in our categories are seeing in a similar fashion. Second, I think we are seeing now and we have remarked upon it during our introductory comments that categories from a value point of view are a little softer, volumes are still pretty healthy, but values are a little softer. And that doesn't help anybody. The least of which is retailers who are looking for category growth. And as you know, we are advising our retailers as a strategic partner on how to grow categories. And pricing and trade up continues to be a very effective way of growing the categories and retailers know that. So while this certainly is not an easy environment to take pricing, we certainly know about price sensitivities on major brands pretty well. We know about the costs and we know about the discussions that we have with retailers pretty well. So while we don't take it lightly, we certainly think that taking a hard look at selected categories where pricing may be cost justified here in the U.S. is prudent. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Very good. Thank you, guys. I will pass it on. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Powers from UBS. These go ahead. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Yes. Hey. Thanks. Maybe just following up a little bit on that. The guidance outlook you've given, obviously, has a pretty wide range of outcomes built into it. And just how would you handicap the factors that are not fully in your control? In past year, I think we all would've said the macro-environment, inclusive of commodity and FX. But it sounds like from the discussion, you know from your prepared remarks and the discussion we've had so far that maybe you're more concerned about the competitive environment, and the retailer environment be it Amazon, hard discounters or incumbent retailers and how they are reacting. Is that a fair take on the world as you see it that you're more focused on the competitive environment, maybe then the macro as opposed to in past year? Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: I have to say it's both. I would say, however, that the competitive environment has really stepped up, and across the retail landscape you're seeing the same thing we are seeing. That something we are watching closely. And that's why in our outlook this 2% the 4% sales growth, we are assuming in tracked channels, the categories are basically flat. Now let's be clear, in non-track channels, e-Commerce, et cetera it's growing quite a bit faster. But we've tried to be prudent in assuming that in-track channels it's likely to be about flat. So we are certainly watching that carefully as well as the competitive landscape. The other thing we're going to continue to watch s foreign currency. We think it's about a point of headwinds. All we know is, it's volatile. I would point out that in a large part of the foreign currency headwinds will come from the emerging-market, including Argentina. So that's a number we will track pretty closely. And of course, commodities. Improvement played out about as we expected. We started talking about this I think almost a year ago, the fact that we thought commodities would start to increase. We are certainly are seeing it, it's something we watch carefully. So for a lot of reasons, we think the outlook for the top line is balanced. The earnings outlook has obviously got a range on it because of currencies, commodities, and even the effective tax rate which, as we saw in the last year can move quite a bit based on share-based compensation. So, it's early in the year, seems like an appropriate balanced outlook, again, given the variables and I think we just need to get farther into the year to see how some of these things unfold. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's fair enough. As you try to make good on e-Commerce, I was wondering if we could just take a little step back and ask you to talk about how you're going after that opportunity. To what extent is there a separate e-Commerce team at Clorox versus it being integrated into each division and operating unit? My guess is that there's a bit of both going on, but if you could just talk more about how you're set up to make the most of e-Commerce and how that might vary across businesses, obviously, Burt's and Brita and Renew Life, we talked about the opportunity there is more immediate versus, say, core Glad or legacy cleaning. So just a little bit more of how you are kind of operationally going after the opportunity. Thanks. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yes, just to put it in perspective, Steve, and your instincts are pretty good on this. So e-Commerce for the fiscal year grew 30%. So we're certainly seeing an acceleration as we end the fiscal year and e-Commerce in total now accounts for 4% of the company for the first time. And if I look at the largest customer that we have in the e-Commerce space and I look at the last quarter, business almost doubled. So we certainly like where we are. The growth is broad-based across most of our businesses. Certainly intuitive that businesses like Brita, with Brita Stream innovation, is doing particularly well. Businesses like Renew Life, but, frankly, also businesses like Glad Trash, more traditional businesses are doing very well. So broad-based and healthy and that's because we have brands that matter in e-Commerce and we are building and have capabilities and partnerships in the e-Commerce space that matter, too. The way we're organized is that there's a separate P&L. So there is a general manager overseeing the e-Commerce activity. But it's very tightly linked to our corporate functions and very tightly linked to our business units. The corporate functions are in charge of building capabilities, in this case, capabilities that matter in the e-Commerce space. And the business units, of course, have to contribute resources and have to be very tightly strategic aligned with our e-Commerce plans. So this is not unlike how we're operating in other fields and what this does is provide a good balance between having strong focus on the channel and building channel-specific capability, but also ensuring that whatever we do is consistent with the business strategies and, importantly, that it's profitable. As a reminder, I think you all have heard us say before that on average, by and large, e-Commerce profitability is about in line with brick-and-mortar profitability, and that's what we care about given that we're not just after growth, but as you heard us say multiple times in the past and also today, good growth and good growth for us is profitable and sustainable. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Good morning, guys. Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.: Good morning. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Benno, I want to get your perspective, I guess, on the level of satisfaction with the trade spend over the past year. And I guess I ask this in the context of a lot of discussion on the level of intensity, particularly in the U.S. at this point. And you touched on some of this. There seems to be some level of satisfaction with increases in household penetration. But with the benefit of hindsight now looking back over the past 12 months where the depth of promotion here was pretty deep, are you generally satisfied with the longer-term health of the brands? You got seemingly the volume pickup. But now with the benefit of the past 12 months and seeing the data, are you satisfied with key performance indicators, like household penetration? Are you seeing repeat purchase rates? And I sense the answer is yes and that's what's giving you the confidence to lean in here on this 3 points of growth from innovation and new products you're looking out to fiscal 2018. But I was hoping to get your perspective there just because it seems to be a pretty hot topic in the space. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Thank you, Kevin. Trade spend for us is not necessarily evil, but we have certainly increased our trade spend over the last few years as part of our strategy to continue to invest in our brands. We have spent a significant amount of trade to generate fast trial and awareness on innovations. And, again, if I can spend in-store on things like displays, given that trade spend goes far beyond price promotion, then that's a really good spend. And we have done a lot of that and, as a result, our innovation has been successful. And as a result, we've expanded household penetration and we're gaining market share in most of our big and strategic categories. So can't help but feel very positive about the consumer fundamentals that we have. I want to be very clear, and we've said this in the past, we are not interested in buying volume growth or buying market share growth, but earning volume growth and earning share growth. And a strategic and smart approach to trade spend certainly is part of that. Having said that, there are certainly categories, and we've named Litter, Glad Trash and also Disinfecting Wipes, as examples of that where we have invested perhaps more tactically and in response to heightened competitive activity. And that's simply the name of the game and always a balance to respond to competitors and make sure that we send signals that don't lead to an exacerbation of a price promotion in the marketplace. Responding in kind often is the best way of getting trade promotion to subside in the mid and long term. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: So in a nutshell, I feel good about where we are on trade spend, but there are always opportunities to optimize. And we are a very disciplined company. We always look at ROI. The businesses and the general managers are doing that on a quarterly basis. And if there's an opportunity to improve ROIs, they will take advantage of it. And typically you will find more opportunities in buckets where you have increased spending over time. And trade spend certainly falls into that category. So I would expect that, as you would expect as well, we would see trade spend over time probably as continuing to be elevated, but also as an opportunity to be optimized. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks for that, Benno. That's helpful. Just one quick follow-up on an unrelated issue. Your portfolio is doing really well and you can see that in Nielsen data, the share trends have been positive broadly across the portfolio. One area I guess where it still struggles is Brita. And at least based on the Nielsen data, it's down double digits. Can you give us an update there? That's probably like a 20 basis point, 25 basis point drag or so on total company top line results. Is there more investment that's needed there? More innovation would you consider selling that? Or is that a potential exit? Any update there would be helpful. Thank you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: We're seeing green shoots on Brita, but it's certainly not where it needs to be, And we've always said that this is going to take time. Again, we will earn growth, not buy growth. As a reminder, track channels, what you're seeing, accounts for less than two-thirds of sales on this category. And we're seeing certainly better performance in non-track channels. So perhaps that gives you additional perspective. But what we've done is invest behind the brand, in particular the recent innovation, Brita Stream. And Brita Stream results are really encouraging. It's now become the number-one pitcher family. And in Q4, what you've seen is sales were flat as the lift from innovation was offset by a strategic choice that we made to rationalize the lower-margin part of the portfolio as part of our efforts to drive growth profitably. If you just look at the core business, back on the topic of green shoots, which is poured through systems and filters and accounts for about 80% of the business, volume actually has grown mid-single digits behind this innovation. So as I look forward, we'll continue to focus on this core segment, we'll continue to invest behind the innovation, which is successful and my hope is that in 12 months from now, we'll see continued improvements on Brita. But admittedly, it's not exactly where we want it to be. But it's moving in the right direction. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Thank you very much for the time. Good luck. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, there, and thank you for taking my questions, so and congrats on the results. So following up on the comments of the increased marketing investment, the 200 basis points that you alluded in the slides and it doesn't sound to me, by the way, too high given your performance, but how do you break down in terms of trade spending against advertising? So and given incremental spend that you mentioned, and it doesn't seem potentially not incrementally in total amount, but just a better distribution of it. Why should the sales growth in fiscal year 2018 be below the long-term kind of like more the long-term algorithm of 3% to 5%? Should we see the 2% to 4% as the new long-term normal? And related to that, do you see some additional distribution gains? Perhaps some innovation as you replace faster-moving items against your core, let's say, core portfolio? Thank you. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Okay. Andrea, you've got a couple of questions there. Let me see if I can answer each of them in turn. But let me start off with the outlook, and answer the question around 3% to 5%, which, as we have said for some time, we do believe that over the very long term is the right growth rate for the company. Now, there's a couple of things I would point out. It presumes that the categories \u2013 this is in track channels, of course, but also untracked, grow 1% to 2%. As we said in our opening comments, as we've said subsequent, the categories are flattish, at least on a track basis. So that's certainly weighing on the results a little bit. We also have about 1 point of FX headwind built in there. So that's part of the reason you're more in the 2% to 4% than the 3% to 5%. But again, I think 3% to 5% still feels right for the company. As far as investment, the choice between advertising or trade spending, your question seemed to allude to how do we think of that? We follow the money. We look at returns on investments. So we have significantly, over the last few years, stepped up our level of advertising. Why? It's working. We've stepped up digital. Why? Because it's working. And we are getting the returns, and we can see the returns, both in volume and in sales and importantly in terms of profit. That's why we've been increasing it. We've also increased trade promotion spending. We brought that number up because when the consumer's ready to spend, it's great to put a situation in store where it really helps that. So I think you will continue to see us adjust spending both in absolute as well as by mix of spending based on where the opportunities are, innovation portfolio, et cetera. But I think on balance, we feel good about the level of investment, but we will adjust that up and down and adjust the mix as needed. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And just to be clear, Steve, the 2% that you have on this slide includes both, right, trade spend and advertisement? It looks low. Or that's the 2% that you talk on the slides is everything? Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: I think to be clear, what we had talked about going back several years ago, you're not referencing the quarter or the year. I think you're referencing that several years ago as a part of our 2020 strategy, what we had said is we wanted to invest one point of incremental sales growth, call it $60 million, in incremental consumer demand building investment, whether that be trade, maybe a bit of R&D or advertising. We've gone well beyond that. And we've done that because we've had the innovation programs to invest behind, and we've done it because it's worked. I would say today we feel very good about the level of investment. Although, as Benno pointed out, we are going to continue to really look at all of these buckets and just make sure that we are getting the highest possible ROIs for all of the spend. But, today, we feel good about the investments we have made and we are going to stay the course. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And the shelf space, lastly, sorry \u2013 just building to the growth. Do you still have some potential additional shelf space? Because what we see the TDPs (47:45) we can't really track everything. As Benno said before, a bunch of these other categories, especially the probiotics, we can't track. So you still have embedded in this guidance there is also some gains in distribution, right? Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: I think over the next couple of years, yes, we do believe there's distribution opportunities certainly with Renew Life in food, drug, mass and expanding that. We've got opportunities as we bring consumer meaningful innovation to shelf. We believe that will create opportunities for incremental shelf space. So I think the short answer is, yes. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yes, Andrea, maybe just a quick add on. I actually think that shelf space rationalization is an opportunity that's as big as shelf space expansion. What I mean by that is that a lot of retailers, among them our biggest retailer, are realizing that having more variety on shelf isn't necessarily something that the consumer rewards them for, because consumers love to have clarity at shelf and want to find the brands that they love, which happen to be market leaders quickly and without a lot of barriers. We, of course, have a lot of those market leaders and brands they love, and we expect to benefit from more rationalized shelving, that is less cluttered and more consumer friendly, and we are seeing that with several of the customers. So I would look at that as an additional opportunity whereas perhaps less about expanded shelves, but a fewer SKUs at shelf to make consumers' shopping trip easier and make it easier for consumers to find the Clorox brands. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you, Benno, and thank you, Steve. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Just wanted to follow up a little bit on levels of brands as far as fiscal 2018 goes, because as we sort of think about, first on advertising, do you expect much of a change in advertising level, you know, just the ad ratio in fiscal 2018? So that's question number one, actually. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Well, to answer question number one, we would say the advertising level, which is at about 10% of sales in fiscal 2017, that feels about right to us. You're going to see some variability across quarters depending on what we emphasize and, of course, the number could move up or down a bit but we think that number is about right to support our brands. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Perfect. And then, so pricing is going up. It's a little bit from international to recapture FX. It's a little bit from potentially commodities, so recapture that. And then perhaps a little bit opportunistic as well. So I guess I am just trying to better understand your level of confidence in realizing all that price benefit, especially considering the backdrop of retail competition right now, which your peers are doing, particularly, your more domestic peers? Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Yes, I think the confidence level is fairly high. Keep in mind the majority of the pricing that we're anticipating is coming from international markets where we're dealing with much higher rates of inflation and it's pretty well accepted by the consumer in that area that you're going to see rising prices. And if you go back and look at the last couple of years, we've got a very strong track record of taking pricing in international. Of course, it's never easy, which is why we try to marry it up with innovation and other things we can do, but I think we feel pretty good there. I think all we are saying is that in the U.S., as we now start to see commodity costs continue to move up on a consecutive basis, higher rates of inflation, we're going to go back, not broadly, but we're going to go back on a very selective basis and go look at where there may be some opportunities for pricing and where it's cost justified, where it makes sense, where we can marry it up with innovation hopefully. We're going to take a look at that and see if there isn't an opportunity there. But again, our outlook for 2% to 4% contemplates a small amount of U.S. pricing. Our outlook is reliant on innovation and keeping our base healthy and driving against our growth initiatives for each of our business. It's not a pricing driven growth plan. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thanks. And then just on innovation, I imagine you will give us a lot more detail at Analyst Day, but is it fairly uniform in terms of the expectations across the board? Or are there certain brands that are seeing more activity this year versus prior years? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yes, Olivia, on innovation, I would say that past is a good predictor of what's going to happen in the future. Certainly, we like broad-based innovation across the entire portfolio. We also like a skew of our innovations towards what we call the growth businesses and I think that will continue. We also like multiple year innovation platforms, so I would say there's an opportunity, the first opportunity for us, is actually to continue to invest in some of the very successful fiscal year 2017 innovations in the back half and I would name Clorox Scentiva, Fresh Step with Febreze and also Brita Stream as examples. And then as you rightly pointed out, you will get more information during Analyst Day on what this will look like. I'd also remind everybody that innovation for us typically tends to be skewed more towards the back half and this fiscal year will be no exception. The one innovation I'd like to point everybody's attention to, perhaps, that we can talk about because it's going on right now is as we talk about differentiation and product improvements on our large brands to keep value sharp is on Clorox liquid bleach, where last month we began rolling out a new technology that we call CLOROMAX. And CLOROMAX is a patented polymer technology which for the first time in what is a 104-year-old history on the product, not just cleans surfaces but also protects surfaces, also has a laundry benefit in that it keeps laundry whiter longer. So it's a really consumer noticeable and meaningful innovation that we'll start supporting through marketing next month and that we're excited about. And that's part of an ongoing program to keep our brands healthy and not just get into new spaces but keep core brands and core categories differentiated and deliver better value to consumers, which we continue to think, in this environment, is the right way to go. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks so much, Benno. Operator : Our next question comes from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Just a couple of big picture questions, Benno, maybe if you can help out. Housing formation has been an important part of category growth in the businesses you compete in, as well as the unemployment rate. And those two have looked pretty good recently. And every company across the space this quarter has been talking about a weak environment. I'm just trying to maybe understand from the research you've done, what exactly is going on? What do you think is really happening with the category and the consumer? And then the second question is when you really get out of the here and now and think about the future, disruption obviously has been coming at an accelerated pace. If you were to identify three to five things you think would really shape and evolve this industry or the industries you compete in and the way you think about your strategy, what would you call out? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yes, Nik, thank you. On the first one, yes, you look at consumer fundamentals quite positive, right? You look at the metrics, but you certainly also look at confidence, unemployment, overall spending, that's all quite healthy, which is why, as we think about our categories, consumers buy our categories. We're not seeing a malaise in the consumer at all. That's quite healthy and steady, which maybe isn't a surprise, because we mostly deal with everyday products that are somewhat indispensable and we have a lot of market leaders and we invest in them. So feel good about the consumer environment, frankly. When we talk about a more competitive retail environment, then it's largely driven by heightened competitive activity and it's driven by retailer activity. Certainly, retailers are pushing value, right, well documented in this environment where there's retailer overcapacity, in this environment where perhaps there's a little bit of elevated anxiety around the emergence of discounters. So I would say a lot of it is driven by the players in the field and by retailers. Consumer environment, quite healthy. Disruption, I would point at two. And those are the two that I think are also well documented. One is the retail environment, where there's overcapacity and where there's certainly speculation about perhaps more consolidation and a disruption in this space, and we'll have to see how well the said discounters will do, but I think the retailer space continues to be one that we're watching. I'll also point out that our company has continued to do extremely well no matter whether times were good or bad with retailers, and we think that it's not an either/or world, but an and world for us, meaning that we have to do well with core brick-and-mortar customers, but also with emerging customers, for instance in the e-Commerce space and last quarter is a really great example of how we're doing that exceedingly well. So retailers is perhaps the one disruption, and the second one that will also probably not surprise you when I mention it is technology. Consumers migrate towards technology and, of course, that means that commerce is also migrating towards technology and there will be winners and losers. And what's important for us is to continue investing, and we're doing that well, and of course the growth rates that we have on e-Commerce are a good way of letting you know that we're quite successful and we're of course also doing very well as we think about technology marketing, and that's evidenced by the fact that we now in fiscal year 2017 spent 45% of our working media dollars in digital and social, and that's up from fiscal year 2016, and I wouldn't be surprised if that's up again in fiscal year 2018. On that note, we can also talk about the fact that we have recently started the strategic marketing partnership with Facebook, elevating the commitment that we've had with them to a strategic level. We've had a similar partnership that's been very successful and working very well for us with Google in place for a number of years now. And Facebook is next in line. And we have really great complementary capabilities that work for them and work well for us. And what that will hopefully continue to do is make sure that the ROIs that we are seeing in digital, which are very strong, need to continue to be healthy. And I think there may be even room for improvement. So I pointed retailers and technology as the most prevalent sources of disruption. And the good news is that our strategy has provided leadership in both areas for the company for a while now, and we'll update everybody in October on how we'll keep driving that. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you, Benno. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Good morning. Thanks very much. Couple of questions. First, what products, Benno, would you say \u2013 thank you for all that data. What products would you say you're selling best proportionately through e-Commerce as a whole? And outside of e-Commerce, your whole company, do you think it's fair to say as you emphasize consumer value that you're getting a disproportionate amount of growth from a higher income household maybe than you have in the past? Any insight you have around that. And my second question is,. you've haven't had this little debt for a long time and it's never been cheaper. So does that indicate any course of action to you from a capital allocation standpoint? Does it make looking at acquisitions harder? Or are there modes of capital usage? Thank you very much. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, I'll let Steve comment on that. And I'll take the first two, Jonathan. The best businesses on e-Commerce, I've touched upon them earlier, are businesses like Renew Life and Burt's Bees and Brita. On those businesses, e-Commerce accounts for north of 10% of sales. And if that's a precursor of things to come for the other businesses, then that's great. But I'd also say that the growth is really broad-based. We're seeing really nice growth in our Professional business, we're seeing nice growth in trash. We have a lot of brands that resonate with consumers in e-Commerce, and I feel good about how we're driving it across the entire portfolio. On consumer value, no, actually, your question was are we getting a disproportionate amount of growth from the higher end of consumers? No. Our brands are as relevant for less affluent consumers. We're seeing strong growth across the entire spectrum. Also, as you look at different age groups, we're seeing strong growth across various age groups, including Millennials. And that's because we're investing in the business and we're going where consumers are. And that's because we're keeping the value sharp in our categories at high price points, but also at lower price points. And we manage our business across the entire spectrum of the consumer landscape very well. And, with that, I'll let Steve comment on that. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Well, we're seeing the same thing you are in debt. It has been, and continues to be, fairly cheap actually. And we'll see how that unfolds over the coming years. Interest rates are anticipated to begin rising at some point. What have we been doing about it? Well, every time we've had debt come due, we've generally put debt long in the market to try to lock that into our capital structure and take advantage of it. We think it's good for shareholders. And since it's a permanent part of the capital structure, it seems to make sense to us. If you look at the next 12 months or so, we do have some debt coming due in October. We've got about $400 million coming due. So we'll take a hard look at that and see what our financing choices are. But in terms of capital allocation priorities, those remain unchanged. We're going to continue to be disciplined in how we allocate capital, how we run this business. It's great when debt is cheap. We're certainly taking advantage of that by going long in the market with our debt placement. But it doesn't change how we think of investment decisions, which is really about investing for the long term for the benefit of our shareholders. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. I wanted to go back to top line a little bit, please. So in 2017, obviously that's 4%. Renew Life made up about 2 points, Costco kind of roundabout 1 point, or less than 1 point. So it was really more like 2% of top-line growth in 2017 without those things. 4% actually more like a 2%. So if I look forward to 2018, you're saying 3% to 5% ex-currency. You're saying the world is more competitive, but at the same time, you're saying you're trying to take pricing. And it sounds like maybe the pricing is more outside the U.S. except for strategically in the U.S. So I'm struggling getting from 2 points up to 3 points or 5 points, unless you already have pricing locked in or you already have shelf space gains locked in. So I just struggle with that gap, especially when you say things are just tougher from a competitive perspective. And we know everything is tougher broadly from a retailer perspective as well. So just another crack at that might be helpful for me at least. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Okay, Ali. I'll echo what I think I've said in my opening comments as well as answering the question a few times. I do think the 2% to 4% outlook we have is balanced. It's prudent. As you say, it does have a couple of assumptions. Innovation, 3 points, feel good about that. A bit of pricing. It's not a huge amount of pricing, most of it's coming from international, but there is some pricing in there. Renew Life, no question we'll be lapping that, as I said earlier. But importantly, it will contribute to the growth rate of the company because it's growing much faster than the portfolio with attractive gross margins, I might add. So I think that's going to help us. And then finally, it's our U.S.-based business. I feel good about the base business in the U.S. Our Burt's Bees business is continuing to do well and we've got an exciting innovation plan for 2018. Our litter business, (1:05:46), Febreze and other initiatives is doing well. Our cleaning business, particularly in disinfecting wipes, but even more broadly, continues to do well. And I'm excited by the new product launches, like Scentiva and some of these platforms we're creating. So I think when we look at the totality of that, we believe we've got a solid plan to get into 2% to 4%. Let's see what happens with currencies. Let's see what happens with categories as we go through the year. Again, we're 30 days into it. But that's the outlook that we have and that's the business plan that we're executing against today. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So on those business plans, again, about a 3% to 5% organic is what you're aiming for. How much of it is already locked up? So do you have agreements on pricing for the year already and do you have the shelf space placements for Renew Life and others already? How much of that is actually in the bag, so to speak, versus still in negotiations for those pricing and shelf space in particular? Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Ali, I don't think we're going to get into that kind of granularity retailer by retailer, brand by brand. Again, I would say that we certainly feel good about the distribution expansion plans for Renew Life. We've been well underway with those plans for some time. We're already starting to see that distribution pick up. And as far as pricing, I think we've got a very good demonstrated track record. So I think we provided quite a bit of color to the investment community this morning around our outlook and how we're thinking of it. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I'm not asking very specifically. I'm just saying how does this stuff work. At this point, would you have pricing agreed to over the next year, shelf space agreed to over the next year? I totally get it. Don't tell me brand by brand, just in terms of the operations how this works. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: That depends on when you take the pricing. Obviously, in the second half of the fiscal year, the answer would be no. For pricing actions in international that are bit more imminent, the answer would be yes, we've been working on it. Again, I would just reference you back to the bridges we've provided historically. And I think the track record for sales for innovation, even for distribution, is quite good. So you're just going to have to take it on faith that we've got good business plans that we're executing against it. That doesn't mean we can't be wrong on the 2% to 4% outlook. It just means it's our best estimate at this point and based on the prevailing trends that we're seeing and how we've been executing. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, if I go back to many of your remarks over the past, I don't think our company is seen as exuberant when we look at our outlook when I go back to Steve's remarks that this is a balanced outlook that reflects confidence in our strategy. It certainly also reflects what we know is a difficult retail environment. But it's balanced. Right? It's early in the fiscal year, but it's balanced, but we feel good about the 2% to 4%. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And then just my last one, on that balance, you say in your press release and you've talked before, from an innovation perspective in 2018, three points of incremental sales and about 1 point of price increases, those are the words in the release. Just for clarity sake, is that 4% total, 3 points of incremental sales and about 1 point in price increase? Is that just 3%? And is it really balanced, quote, unquote, or is it really dependent on innovation, so we're seeing any wavering interest in your innovations at this point? That's it for me. Thanks. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Ali, I think we're getting into too much detail, but three points is incremental sales growth on a year-over-year basis, one point of pricing best estimate, that's the net effect of the rate impact in sales that we have calculated. But with that, I think we've provided what we can provide for today. If you have other questions, we're happy to answer those. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Shannon Coyne from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Shannon Coyne - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So in looking at some data we have access to, it looks like AmazonBasics made it into the top 10 brands by bestseller share of voice on Amazon in the household cleaning supplies category year-to-date. And I was happy to see that you have two brands in the top 10. And I know you addressed private label as a whole already, and I understand that. But can you talk a little bit more specifically about your strategy to fend off Amazon specifically, given their potential increase control over search going forward? And how does that play out over time as you increase your online penetration, for example? Do you see the cost of placement with Amazon going up over time? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, Shannon, a lot of questions in there. So I'll maybe leave it as our business with Amazon as is our business with other e-Commerce retailers. It's very strong. I surely expect private label to play a role in e-Commerce as is the case in brick-and-mortar. You've noted from my previous remarks that I feel comfortable in our ability to compete with private label. And at the end of the day, the U.S. consumer is a brand buyer, and our brands resonate very well in e-Commerce, which is why we have such strong growth rates. And which is why you noted our brands play extremely well, including in the research or survey that you suggested. So I don't look at Amazon as a customer that's in any way different than our other customers, and I would look at that as an opportunity as well as a risk. But the opportunity far outweighs the risk, and we're taking advantage of it. We are partnering with Amazon on how to grow the categories, on how to build virtual shelves, on how to help them create a supply chain that is efficient and that works for us. So there's a lot of good news here. And we certainly are counting on that good news to continue. There's a lot of growth upside for us as a company. Shannon Coyne - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks. That's helpful. And just one more question and then I'm done. Burt's Bees was up double-digit this quarter. Can you talk about how big you think that brand can become, and then what you're doing to gain or defend market share given the likely heightened competition going forward, given the category growth that we're seeing in the natural category. For example, The Honest Company entering Target. Would you do an M&A transaction in this category to move faster? Or can you just talk a little bit about that category? Thanks. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. So, perhaps as a clarification, Shannon, so the business, this last quarter, was up solidly off of a double-digit growth last year ago. We have talked about Burt's Bees a lot over the last few years as one of our growth SKUs and the results have certainly warranted that. We have a healthy core, and the core is growing with key customers, and we have a lot of innovation that continues to be on track. Last year's highlight was lip color; lip color's the number five brand in the category right now. It's overtaken a lot of large companies and larger brands based on a strong reception from consumers and customers. If you think about Q4, we saw particularly strong consumption in sales in the core lip care category and strength across most key customers. So, really strong business with a healthy core, with innovation that's on track, and certainly continued plans to invest in the consumer to invest in more innovation, and you'll see some of that during Analyst Day, and continued strong focus on the core lip business knowing that we have a lot of tailwind from the consumers. So I feel really good about that, and we've had a really nice track record of growing this business for 10 years now and I don't expect that to stop anytime soon. Shannon Coyne - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thanks. Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.: I think we have one more question after this. Operator : Yes. And our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I'm fine. We can pull the call. You've covered a lot of ground. Thank you so much. Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.: Thank you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Thank you. Thank you, all. Thanks for joining us on this call, and I look forward to seeing all of you hopefully in October at Analyst Day in New York, and to speaking with you again in November when we share our first quarter results. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Clorox Company First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Managing Director of Investor Relations for the Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.: Thanks. Welcome, everyone and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, Clorox' Chairman and CEO; Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, that's thecloroxcompany.com. Let me remind you that on today's call, we'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA, and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliations with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the financial results of our website as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release. Please recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcome to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. With that, I'll cover our Q1 business performance, discussing highlights in each of our segments. Steve will then address our financial results as well as our updated outlook for fiscal year 2018. Finally, Benno will close with his perspective on the business followed by Q&A. For the total company, first quarter volume and sales, each grew 4%, with sales growing across all four segments. Sales in tracked channels remain healthy and we continue to see very strong growth in non-tracked channels, particularly in e-commerce and clubs. I will now turn to our results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q1 volume and sales, each grew 5%. Sales growth this quarter also include less than two points of benefits from shipments related to the recent hurricane. Cleaning segment's strong top line growth was led by home care, which grew by high-single digits on top of the double-digit growth in the year-ago quarter. We're very pleased by the continued momentum of our largest SBU, especially as the growth continues to reflect broad-based strength across the Clorox equity portfolio, with all-time record shipments of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, as well as our recently introduced Scentiva wipes and sprays. Consistent with these results, home care delivered its 13th consecutive quarter of market share gains. In laundry, sales and volume grew mainly behind shipments of Clorox liquid bleach, as retailers stock-up for hurricane-related purchases. The quarter's results also reflect continued growth in our premium Clorox Splash-Less bleach resulting in share gains on total Clorox liquid bleach. Lastly, within the Cleaning segment, our professional products volume and sales were flat, reflecting the divestiture of the Aplicare business in late August. The balance of professional products business is performing strongly. Turning to Household segment, first quarter volume increased 7% and sales grew 5%, with broad-based growth across all business units. Starting with our Glad bags and wraps business, sales growth was driven by ongoing success from our premium OdorShield trash bags, especially in e-com and the club channel as well as slight gain from hurricane-related shipments. In Charcoal, volume grew slightly while sales declined slightly, due to unfavorable mix as well as higher trade promotion investments to support our business. We continue to feel good about our plans for this business going forward and the category is healthy. Cat Litter volume and sales each grew by high-single digits behind our Fresh Step innovation and strong merchandising support. We're pleased with the strong momentum we are seeing on this business as reflected by four consecutive quarters of market share growth. Finally, turning to RenewLife, Q1 was the first full quarter lapping the acquisition. We're pleased to report high-single digit sales growth behind distribution expansion, leveraging our sales capabilities. Additionally, we started distribution within the club channel in October. In our Lifestyle segment, volume increased 2% and sales grew 4%. Burt's Bees delivered double-digit sales growth this quarter, behind the introduction of our new natural cosmetics line, and first-ever distribution expansion of lip care in the club channel. Burt's Bees grew share in the quarter and we're very pleased with our share gains in the lip color category. In our Brita business, volume and sales declined as gains from innovation behind our new Stream pitcher were more than offset by lower club channel merchandising and a strategic choice to rationalize a lower-margin part of our portfolio. That said, the Stream pitcher is performing well six months after launch, and is now the number two pour-through item behind our Brita Legacy pitcher, which is the market leader. To wrap up Lifestyle, food volume and sales grew behind strong merchandising in club and grocery channels for bottled Hidden Valley dressings. Consumptions remain very strong, and we are especially pleased that our Hidden Valley brand delivered 11th consecutive quarter of share growth. Finally, turning to International. Volume was down 2%, although sales grew 1%. Sales growth reflects the benefits of pricing and innovation, partially offset by unfavorable mix and weaker volume in Argentina due to macroeconomic conditions, and in Puerto Rico, from the impact of the hurricanes. We continue to focus on our Go Lean strategy to drive margin improvement, while selectively investing in Burt's Bees, RenewLife, laundry and home care. Now, I'll turn it over to Steve, who'll provide more information on our Q1 performance and discuss our updated outlook for fiscal year 2018. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Well, thanks, Lisah and let me welcome everyone. We're certainly very pleased with our strong start to fiscal year 2018. We delivered strong sales growth and gross margin expansion across all our U.S. and International segments, in what continues to be a tough environment. What's more, we delivered these results on top of strong results in the year-ago quarter. Turning to our financial results for the first quarter, Q1 sales grew 4%, consistent with volume growth, and our sales results also benefited from about one point of price increases in International, which were more than offset by unfavorable mix, primarily reflecting strong club channel shipments. And as Lisah noted, first quarter sales included the benefit of slightly less than one point from incremental shipments related to the hurricane recovery. At this point, we don't expect the hurricanes will have a meaningful impact on full-year sales. Gross margin came in at 44.9%, an increase of 50 basis points, reflecting 160 basis points of cost savings and 40 basis points of pricing, partially offset by about 90 basis points of unfavorable commodity cost, particularly in resin, and about 80 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics cost. Selling and Administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 13.6% versus 13.9% in the year ago quarter. Our advertising and sales promotion investment levels were about equal to the year-ago quarter, with spending in our U.S. retail business at about 10% of sales to support the long-term health of our brands. Our effective tax rate came in at 31% versus 32% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Now, net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.46, an increase of 7% versus the year-ago quarter. Turning to cash flow for the quarter, net cash provided by continuing operations was $257 million versus $170 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of $87 million. Now, I'll turn to our updated fiscal year 2018 outlook which we've updated based on two items; first, the sales impact from the Aplicare divestiture in late August of this year; and second, the cost increases from the recent hurricanes. Our sales outlook now anticipates sales growth in the range of 1% to 3%, due to the Aplicare sale, which is expected to reduce fiscal year sales by slightly less than one point. And given the timing of the sale, we expect to see the first full quarter impact in our second quarter. Importantly, we continue to feel good about our innovation programs and our expectation for about three points of the incremental sales growth for the year from new products. Turning to gross margin, we now anticipate fiscal year gross margin to be down slightly due to the recent hurricanes. Our updated gross margin outlook reflects an estimated $20 million increase in commodity and logistics costs, most of which is anticipated to occur in our second and third quarters. However, we are continuing to closely monitor commodity costs, which remain volatile. And as a reminder, our previously communicated fiscal year outlook already reflected elevated costs. Given the timing of the hurricane impact, we anticipate our second quarter gross margin may decrease about 150 basis points versus year ago. Importantly, we believe the hurricane cost headwinds should begin to dissipate late in the fiscal year, enabling gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter. Turning to our fiscal year 2018 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, based on our updated assumptions for sales and gross margin, we now expect fiscal year diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.47 to $5.67, a $0.05 reduction versus the previous range of $5.52 to $5.72. As we mentioned in our press release, this updated range anticipates about $0.10 of additional costs from hurricane impacts, about half of which we expect to offset with the strength of our execution and underlying business performance. Looking to the balance of the fiscal year, we anticipate increased volatility over the next few quarters from hurricane-related impacts on our supply chain costs. We will also continue to monitor the trends we previously called out, including the continuation of elevated competitive environment, higher supply chain costs and continued challenging economic conditions in International. The message I'll leave you with today, is that we have the right strategy in place to work through these near-term challenges. First, we will continue investing strongly in product and brand differentiation to keep our value propositions sharp. We feel very good about our strong investments in demand building, including digital marketing, e-commerce and our product innovation pipeline. Second, we'll continue leaning into our cost savings and productivity initiatives to support our margins. And finally, we'll continue executing our Go Lean strategy in International, in order to improve margins through operational efficiencies. And with that, I will turn it over to Benno. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Thank you, Steve and hello everyone. Let me share with you my three key messages for today's call. First, we delivered another strong quarter and start to our fiscal year, which reflects continued broad scale executional strength against our 2020 Strategy. We delivered 4% volume growth on top of 8% in the year-ago quarter. We grew sales and gross margin in every segment and we delivered 7% diluted earnings per share growth, reflecting our emphasis on good growth; growth that's profitable, sustainable and responsible. Second, this strong execution and the fundamental health of our business are helping us partially offset the temporary cost headwinds we're facing. While gross margins will be pressured the next two quarters from the impacts of the hurricanes on our cost structure, our business remains fundamentally strong and healthy, as demonstrated by our Q1 results. It is fundamentally strong and healthy, because we have differentiated products consumers love and a solid innovation pipeline that aims to deliver three points of incremental sales growth in fiscal year 2018. We'll be sharing more about our second half new product plans when we speak with you next quarter. Our business is also fundamentally strong and healthy because we're investing in our brands and we're investing disproportionately in our growth plans, behind demand creation focused on innovation and digital marketing. And with strong ROI, we expect to spend about 50% of our working media budget on digital in fiscal year 2018. And the result of our focus on differentiated products, innovation and investing in our brands means we're winning with consumers. How do we know? We know we're winning with consumers because the majority of our strategic brands are seen as superior in value, as measured by our Consumer Value Measure or CVM, a combination of product experience, brand equity and pricing. We use CVM to fine-tune pricing across our portfolio and we feel confident about our pricing strategies and execution. We also know we're winning with consumers because of the strong progress we're making in growing household penetration, with 72% of our portfolio having growing or stable household penetration, up from 31% just four years ago. Third, we are continually evolving a strategy that has been working and that continues to give me confidence in our ability to create shareholder value over the long-term. To evolve, we will lean into the key value drivers of our 2020 Strategy. We will lean into the prioritization of strong investments in our brand building programs to drive superior value behind innovation and purpose-driven brands. We will lean into the acceleration of portfolio momentum, as we maximize profitable growth and optimize investments between our growth brands and fuel brands. We will lean into the reduction of waste in every aspect of our business, so that savings can be reinvested to fuel growth and to support margin expansion. And finally, we will lean into the continued high engagement of our people as business owners to drive a consumer-centric growth culture. So in summary, in Q1, we delivered strong results across our portfolio. Our business is healthy and we have plans in place to manage the short-term cost pressures we face. And we're evolving our 2020 Strategy off of a strong foundation, as we discussed with you at our Analyst Day last month. All of this gives me confidence that we will continue to deliver growth that's profitable, sustainable and responsible and create shareholder value over the long term. Now, before I open the call up for your questions, I do want to take a moment to recognize the work our teams have been doing across the company to provide humanitarian relief, by donating Clorox bleach and cleaning products, Glad trash bags, and other products, to help support hurricane victims here in the U.S. mainland and in Puerto Rico, as well as for the victims of the Northern California wildfires, the recent earthquakes in Mexico and flooding in Costa Rica. Our disaster relief programs are an important part of our company's heritage and identity and it's tremendously gratifying to have products and highly engaged people that can be of help to so many people. And with that, operator, you may now open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Dorer. We'll take our first question today from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to start with the sales growth guidance for the year, so, all in now, 1% to 3%, down from 2% to 4% previously, and that includes the one point drag from Aplicare. But setting that aside and then setting aside probably, I guess, what's like 20, 25 basis points or so from the hurricane benefit, was there any change to the 3% to 5% organic sales growth guidance for the year within that range? And then I guess is part of that, Benno, what is the expectation for industry growth within your guidance? And, I guess, I ask that within the context that your market share performance has been great, I guess, with the exception of trash bags, which I know you guys are addressing, but the category growth has been kind of flattish, at least in Nielsen channels. And I know, I understand it's higher than that outside of non-track, but still not great, seemingly, based on the syndicated data that we have. So, two parts to the question; one, any change within the 3% to 5%? And then two, if you could comment on industry growth guidance within your overall outlook and whether that's changed at all? Thank you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Kevin, this is Steve Rob. Let me start off. First, just to reground everybody, our previous outlook that we had communicated in early August was for sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%, okay? The latest outlook that we're sharing with everyone today is 1% to 3%. The only reason we're making an adjustment to the outlook is to reflect the divestiture of the Aplicare business in late August, which will reduce sales growth by slightly less than one point. Okay? All other assumptions, there's puts and takes, but generally, all other assumptions remain the same. And we certainly feel good about our first quarter sales growth of 4%. Now, I do want to make one additional point about first quarter sales growth. We delivered 4%, slightly less than one point was related to hurricanes. But I would also remind everybody, we had the divestiture of Aplicare in the first quarter. That was slightly less than a half a point. So you kind of have to bring the two together to really understand it. And then finally, just as a reminder, all of the numbers that we're sharing today are on a GAAP basis. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, your second part, Kevin, categories, I would say, overall solid, no change. And we don't expect that to change in our outlook. We think that the future will behave more like the past, and I would say the current situation is characterized by three things; first of all, tracked channels are actually quite solid. They are now growing at about 1%. Historically, they've grown 1% to 2%, in line with population, so that's about at the low-end; but not bad, to be quite honest. Keeping in mind that tracked channels only account anywhere between less than 50% to 80% of our total category, varying by category and SBU. So, tracked channel is overall pretty solid. The second thing we're seeing is that volume is still tracking ahead of dollars in our categories, and particularly, in tracked channels. Why is that? It's the continued elevated competition, as Steve has noted earlier. That's been elevated for a while, particularly characterized by heavy merchandising, no change versus what we've communicated in the last quarters, also don't expect any change in the future. And then third, we're continuing to see particularly strong growth in non-tracked channels. Our performance has been strong there for a while. Many of our customers in non-tracked channels are growing double-digits. In Q1, just to dimensionalize, about half of our total company sales growth came from non-tracked channels. E-com is leading the way with the largest e-commerce customer up more than 70% in Q1. So, feeling particularly good about the profitable growth in non-tracked channels. So, overall, steady, and we expect the future to be about the same. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Thank you very much. Good luck, guys. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Thanks, Kevin. Operator : We'll go next to Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thank you for the question. Two questions. First, a small one. Steve Robb, I think you mentioned that \u2013 you reminded us that your results are GAAP results, which we always appreciate the cleanliness of that. Are there any unique costs related to either the hurricane, divestments, that you would call out, that you think most other companies would have pro formaed this quarter? Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: As it relates to the hurricane, no, we didn't. The only thing I would call out with respect to the hurricane that was unusual for us was one, that we picked up some incremental volume late in the quarter associated with shipments; two, I would remind everybody that our International results were negatively impacted, associated with Puerto Rico. This is a business that, you know, we're back up and running, but obviously the country is not where it needs to be. That certainly weighed on International results. And then third, I think the only other thing to note, and this is related to the Aplicare divestiture, we did, as a part of the divestiture of this business, we did take a charge in the first quarter of approximately $0.03, and that's included in our first quarter earnings per share. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. That's helpful. And then, Benno, a quick question for you. You mentioned everything that you're leaning into to drive growth. One thing that you've leaned into since you've taken the helm has been a slightly more aggressive posture on M&A, both, obviously, with Aplicare kind of shrinking out of it, RenewLife adding into it. I was hoping you could update us on where your appetite sits today in terms of M&A. And as we think about the forward, the bolt-ons that you pursued, is that the right context? Or if an opportunity for something more needle-moving were to surface, would there be interest on your end? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Thanks for that, Jason. So, in order of priority, first priority always will be to keep the core healthy and I think Q1 results demonstrate that we're doing that well, and we want to continue to do that. The second priority will be to continue to grow RenewLife. That's a category and a business we're very committed to and we want to drive for the long-term. And we feel good about RenewLife. We've obviously had a strong first year after acquisition, grew in the high-single digits in Q1. And in Q2, we'll start expanding with certain club customers, so we want to continue to make that successful as priority number two. And then three, of course, is because we are in a position where our cash flow enables us to put that cash to use for shareholders, whether that's by serving dividends or buybacks, but also by continuing to look for ways to grow the business. So, we've always said that we can do more in M&A, but that we don't have to do more in M&A because we have a healthy core, which allows us to be disciplined. So we are looking. We have continued to look in the spaces that we communicated, in particular in the health and wellness space and in areas around our core businesses. We look at companies small and big, anything that can add value to our shareholders. As Steve has noted often, it continues to be the case that we like those bolt-on acquisitions and RenewLife is a good example of that. But we're not afraid of looking at bigger things if we think that they can add value to our shareholders. But importantly, we'll stay disciplined. So, we made one acquisition over my three years in tenure. I don't know that I would characterize that as more aggressive. I'd call it discipline. Importantly, we have shown that we can integrate an acquisition well and add value. And we certainly can do more and we're looking, but we'll only strike if we feel like we're getting the right business at the right value. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Thanks, Jason. Operator : We'll go next to Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning. First question, just wanted to go back to something you mentioned, Benno. I think you just said the your categories, at least in the tracked channels in the U.S., you're growing about 1% and I thought your guide for this year was based on flat growth in those tracked channels. So, is that part of the $0.05 offset that you guys called out this morning in regards to the hurricane-related commodity inflation? Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Joe, this is Steve. Couple of things. Our sales outlook contemplates categories that will be flat to up slightly over the course of the full year; keeping in mind, it's still early days, let's see how the quarters unfold as we move through. But that's essentially what we had for the sales outlook. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. So the 1% is consistent with that. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Correct. Flat to up slightly, yes. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got it. Okay. And the secondly, on Burt's Bees, you mentioned it was up double-digits, I guess an acceleration from last quarter. And I guess part of that had to do with, I guess, the initial sell-in for cosmetics and the expansion of lip into club. So, if you could quantify for us what that business was up ex those two items, that would be great. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: I don't know that we, Joe, that we give details with that specificity. As you noted, clearly, the lipsticks, the cosmetics launch last quarter has helped. But we're also pleased to say that our core categories have grown share and have grown. Lipsticks continues to be a growth driver as well as the core lip balm. So, it's a combination of all those factors that led to double-digit sales growth last quarter. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : We'll go next to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. A couple of questions. One is, if you could talk a little bit about pricing? We've certainly been hearing that it's been hard to take pricing to offset commodities, given competitive and retailer pressures. Is that consistent with what you're seeing and what you've done from a \u2013 although slightly lower your pricing guidance for the year? Can you in answering that give us an updated sense of what percentage of commodity cost increases you're offsetting now? And, look, I totally understand your philosophy of not changing the pricing on short-term commodity spikes, but we're seeing that it's much more difficult to take pricing and wanted to see what your observation is about that? Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Ali, this is Steve. Let me try this. I would say the pricing environment is never easy, which is why we try to marry it up with innovation, and we try to be smart in terms of where we take pricing. We've been very successful in taking pricing over the last couple of years, primarily though in International where we're seeing higher rates of inflation. As you know and as we communicated at our last Analyst Day, we are looking to make some pricing adjustments. We're taking an increase on disinfecting wipes and other businesses. That's in our second quarter, and we're just in the process of rolling that out. So, I would say, over the very long-term, we're confident in the strength of our brands and the investments we're making, and the ability to take pricing. So, time will tell, but I think right now things are playing out about as we expected. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, and then, Ali, we did talk about our price increase on disinfecting wipes on Analyst Day, that's being implemented as we speak this quarter, and we'll give a more detailed and specific update in our Q2 call in February. But we expect that price increase execution to be done well, and importantly, it's just part of an overall program that on the back of pricing allows us to continue to support innovation on that business. And as you know, our Scentiva platform has been particularly successful lately on wipes and also sprays, which is why we're continuing to expand with new innovation as we speak. So, that's an example of recent price increase that is disciplined and strategic and consistent with our approach to deliver better value for consumers. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So, why is your pricing guidance actually a little bit lower? Is it the price reduction that you told us at your Analyst Day on the mid-size trash bags? Is that what it is? Or \u2013 and why has the guidance been lower a little bit from a pricing perspective in this quarter versus what you'd said last quarter for the year? Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Thanks for the clarification, Ali. I think what we had said in the previous quarter is that our pricing guidance would be about 1%. I think we're now saying a bit slightly less than one point. I wouldn't over-think it. Foreign currencies are also moving a bit as well, and as you know, in International markets in particular, we try to price to recover not just inflation, but also currency effects. So, I would say when you look at the combination of pricing and foreign currency together, it's about what we would expect. And again, we need to get through the next couple of quarters and see how things play out, but no substantive change there. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. And then the other question was around just kind of leverage from top line to bottom line, 4% top line, 7% EPS this quarter looks pretty good. But going forward, it looks like there's less leverage between the top line and the bottom line. I get that some of that is because of the gross margin and the commodity pressures next quarter or two, I get that. But even when you gave your guidance for 2018, there was less leverage between the top line and the bottom line. I am just trying to understand why that might be. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. So, the short answer is, it's really two things, one of which you've already called out. If you look at the commodity forecast that we have and inflationary pressures in 2018 versus fiscal 2017, it's quite a bit higher, particularly in our second and third quarters. So I think that's the biggest driver I would call out, is margin pressures driven by higher commodity costs, which are being further exacerbated by the recent hurricanes. I would also just remind people that in fiscal 2017, we adopted new accounting update around how taxes are treated with share-based compensation. As a result, our tax rate in fiscal 2017 was lower than in fiscal 2016. We're seeing that normalize a bit as we get into 2018. So, there is a little bit of leverage on the tax line as well. So, margin pressures tied to commodities, tax rate, a little bit less leverage there. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : We'll go next to Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. First question is following up on that question regarding pricing, on the trash bags, have you seen competitors respond to your price reduction, particularly in light of the commodity environment? I wonder if other people aren't lowering their prices to follow simply because they're dealing with the commodity pressure that you're seeing as well. So that's the first question. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, too early to say on that, Wendy. We will have a better update for you in Q2. That's being implemented as we speak. We've certainly seen the first customers take pricing down as intended on our volume, and we're seeing the positive impact from that, but a little too early to call what will happen on the competitive side. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then two other just quick follow-ups. Number one, on the shipments related to the hurricane, are you confident that that extra shipment volume that you saw late August, beginning of September, has actually sold through? Or is there a risk that some of those extra packs or whatever, are still sitting on the shelf? So does that impact the outlook for the second quarter at all? And then just second thing, just on RenewLife, I know distribution expansion is a big part of the story, and it sounds like you're making great headway there, but can you just give us an order of magnitude, how far \u2013 like, sort of an ACV type measurement, are you at 30% ACV, and you think you have 80%. I'm just wondering for how long are we going to hear about distribution expansion? Because it's all good, but I just wonder how much growth it can add to the business. Thanks. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Wendy, let me take the first question and I'll have Benno address the second question. Regarding your first question which is the incremental shipments associated with hurricane, there's no question, but some of that is likely sold through to consumption and then used in the hurricane cleanup efforts. But what's also true, and it's hard to quantify, so the short answer is we don't know exactly, is that likely some of that may have gone into the trade inventories as customers were stocking up in anticipation of the hurricane, and that may partially offset in the second quarter. So, as we look to our second quarter volume and sales growth, and sales in particular, the things we're watching carefully is, what happens with the hurricane and does some of that reverse out in the second quarter? Of course, we've got Aplicare. That will be the first full quarter where we have the divestiture in the numbers. And so, for a large reason, as we look at the outlook for sales growth on a full year of 1% to 3%, I think if I looked into the second quarter, I think it's possible we'll be at the lower end of that, just because of the Aplicare divestiture and also just because there may be some offsets to the hurricane. But we're 30 days into the quarter, we need to kind of get through and see how that will unfold. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, Wendy. And then on... Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Oh! Yeah. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Sorry for interrupting. And then on RenewLife for distributing expansion, there's room at least through the end of the fiscal year to keep going on that; we're not done yet for a while. We're obviously in the natural channel. We have some room to grow in food, drug, mass, and obviously club is being expanded as well, but there's still room even within club customers. But then what I would say is beyond that the real opportunity here is to go from a quantity of distribution expansion to quality of distribution build. What I mean by that is, if you look at stores and you look at shelf placements, you look at clarity of merchandising, quantity of merchandising, all the things that we do so well in our established categories, there's tremendous room for us and what's required to keep building that, which is a long-term strategic approach, is to work with customers on category management as we typically do so well, guiding them on their strategies to grow these categories. And then also innovation, of course, which will help us expand distribution and placements within the customer groups that we're already in, and we will see our distribution machine turn on in the calendar year 2018 and will give you an update as we go little bit further into the fiscal year. So, distribution expansion was a big reason why we thought we can add value to the RenewLife business. It's been playing out as planned so far, and we still have quite a ways to go. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Hello, everybody. Thank you for taking my question. My question is regarding gross margin. So, I was hoping and I appreciate, Steve, your comment about 150 basis points impact on the quarter \u2013 on the coming quarter. But then what makes you believe that this is going to improve as we go? I think you alluded to Wendy's question on potentially some of the impacts that we saw in the pricing movements you've made. Is that something you're embedding in terms of pricing recovery at some point, pricing pass-through? Or are you just hoping or just baking into your margin \u2013 not margin gains, I'm sorry, market share gains through the balance of the year? Thank you. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Thanks, Andrea. Well, we're not hoping. We have good plans in place to drive our margins. Obviously, we're very pleased with the 50 basis points of gross margin expansion in the first quarter. But as I indicated in my opening comments, I do think the second quarter gross margins will be challenged, likely down 150 bps; although it could be a little more or a little bit less than that. Why? Well, number one, it was always going to be the most challenging quarter that we had, because we had rising commodity costs in that quarter. And when you add the impact of the hurricanes, it's even further challenged both in commodities as well as manufacturing and logistics costs. That's the bad news. Now, the good news is, what we believe, and at least what we've seen in history over time is these elevated costs tend to go on for a couple of quarters. So, our belief is that the challenges will peak in the second quarter. They'll continue into the third quarter, but perhaps a bit better, okay? So, margins will be under pressure in the third quarter, but a bit less. By the time we get to the fourth quarter, we think that these hurricane-related costs, most \u2013 maybe not all, but most of them should have dissipated. As result, our cost savings, the pricing that we've got planned, the Go Lean efforts in International, combined with our margin-accretive innovation, that all of that should enable us to get back on track to get gross margin expansion. So, that's our outlook as we know it today. As I did indicate, there's going to be variability across the quarters. Certainly commodity markets today are fairly volatile, but we think we've got good plans in place and we'll see what happens as we go through the next few quarters. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : But just to be clear, you're not putting on the guidance \u2013 including the guidance, any price increase beyond the wipes, right? Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: We have always planned for pricing in International. As we previously communicated, we've got wipes pricing. Beyond that, I won't comment, other than to say, I think we've got good robust plans in place. And the biggest single driver of margin expansion will be the cost savings programs, which we continue to feel very good about. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Thank you, Steve. Operator : We'll go next to Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thanks very much. Two questions. First, when you talk about the net impact of the hurricanes, at about a dime, does that include whatever profit impact \u2013 and forgive me if I missed this, from the increased Cleaning sales in the current quarter? And if you could give us a bit about how you went about the process of determining what's hurricane impact and what's not, because it seemed like the lifts in maybe August and September were pretty substantial, but there might be some other stuff going on there. And the second question was on the advertising, two of the four segments you called out specifically increased advertising and promotion. Just returns you're getting on that, is that more shifted towards digital? You've been leaders in moving advertising towards digital. Are you getting \u2013 is lift getting better, worse? Any comment about that spend level and anticipated returns? Thank you. Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.: Jonathan, let me take the first part of the question. I'll have Benno address the second. As relates to the impact of the hurricane, these are our best estimates. It's very hard, obviously, to know exactly how much the hurricane impacted us, but we do have advanced analytics. We spend a lot of time trying to understand volume drivers. And so the numbers that we're providing reflect our best estimates as to what we think the impact was in the first quarter for sales growth. Again, we're going to watch and see how much of that may reverse out in the second quarter. In terms of the earnings impact from the hurricane, I don't think we've specifically communicated it, but it would be at a typical margin that you would expect for businesses like bleach and Glad and businesses that benefited from that lift. Although, again, I'll quickly point out, at least in the first quarter, we did take a $0.03 charge associated with the divestiture of the Aplicare business. So, I think you need to look at, when you talk the hurricane in the first quarter, you need to look at the impact of the hurricane on top and bottom line, but you also need to contemplate that we divested a business, which obviously impacted growth, and had a modest impact or a small impact on earnings. And again, how this plays out over the coming quarters is something we're all going to watch very carefully. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: And, Jonathan, your question on advertising sales promotion, if I put it in strategic context, the strategic choice we've made is to be very aggressive about costs on our business that does not matter to the consumer, take that cost out, and then reinvest it into our brands to create a profitable growth, and do so with discipline and with a strong eye on ROI. And the increases in spend that benefit digital fall squarely into that camp of pursuing profitable growth with discipline and on strategy. We are pleased with the returns that we see in digital; the returns generally are better than in other media channels, whether that's TV or others. The returns are also getting better year-on-year every year, which is a tribute to our focus on continuous improvements, the capabilities that we are building, and of course, the partnerships that we have with other companies here in the Bay Area and on the West Coast. So, we like what we do in digital, which is why the spending this year is going to be about half of our total working media budget, which is yet again up from last fiscal year, and also quite substantially higher than what our peer group is doing. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Carey with Bank of America. Christopher M. Carey - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, everyone. So, just a bigger picture perspective on dynamics you've seen at U.S. mass retail, and how these have sort of evolved over the course of the year. Because clearly destocking in the U.S. impacted some at the start of the year, but not as much for you, but growth in those channels have remained somewhat sluggish into this quarter. So, can you talk to your relative outperformance here and maybe comment on dynamics around shelf space, so the total amount of shelf space maybe not expanding, but the mix or amount of SKUs are consolidating? And then, somewhat related, like kind of how have retailers approach to more premium brands evolved this year as maybe they've given a bit more support to private label? So those two. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: So, in general, the big picture is the state of U.S. mass retail isn't dramatically different from what it's been over the last decade. On your first point, Chris, we certainly haven't seen any destocking. We also wouldn't expect any destocking. We manage our stocks with our customers tightly and electronically and routinely. And if you think about the nature of our products, they are products that are bought on a regular basis, routinely. So, there isn't a lot of up and down. The broad big picture that I would point you towards is that we're seeing a bifurcation in the marketplace, limited assortment retailers are winning, retailers that are focused on offering consumers value are winning, and as a result private label is gaining more support from retailers and is gaining share, but also market leaders are doing well. And as you know, more than 80% of our portfolio is in market leaders. So we are doing well too, because what retailers do is, as they consolidate shelf space is, they know they need market leaders for growth and they need private label for margin. That's a recipe that we've seen for a while. That's a recipe that retailers are pursuing that we are seeing perhaps accelerate, but that creates tailwind for our brands, which is why we're doing so well, not just with some, but with practically all of our major retailers in the U.S. Beyond, I would just point to our outperformance on sales growth back to the fact that we invest in our brands versus hunker down. We have innovation, in innovation-starved environment. We invest in digital and in keeping brands relevant and engaging to consumers. So, all the things that create growth the right way, meaning, in a profitable and sustainable fashion is something that we do well, is something that we've done for a while, and is something that, frankly, we're quite good at, and is perhaps somewhat differentiated in today's environment, which is why we are seeing results that we are quite proud of. Christopher M. Carey - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Shirley Serrao - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. This is Shirley Serrao on behalf of Lauren Lieberman. I just wanted to follow-up on an earlier question around Burt's. It sounds like it's your first foray into club with lip care line. First off, did you displace another competitor here or is this sort of a new focus category for the channel? And then secondly, we didn't really see any mix degradation in Lifestyle, the way we saw in Cleaning when you gained distribution in club with wipes last year. So, was that offset by something else this quarter or just not as significant as a dynamic in the category? Thanks. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yes. Thanks, Shirley. This was incremental, so not a displacement, but certainly a recognition of the strength of the brand not just in club but in general. And the reason why it hasn't shown up as a negative in mix is that it's actually a very profitable SKU that we have, first and foremost. We've also just started. We certainly hope that over the next few quarters, this is going to continue to grow, but I wouldn't expect it to be a significant drag on our margins in this segment, because, as I said, this is a very profitable SKU. We, as you know, are very focused on profitable growth. And when we consider expansion opportunities, like this one in club, we want to make sure that we do it based on a position of strength, and this plan certainly doesn't need excessive discounting, which is why we're pleased to see the early success behind this club expansion, but also the profitability. Shirley Serrao - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.: We'll take one more question. Operator : We'll go next to Jason Gere with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Thanks, guys for squeezing me in. Maybe sticking on the topic of mix a little bit, you're talking about, in Brita, rationalizing some lower margin businesses. So, just wondering as you look at the portfolio, in an industry where it seems like it's very over-skewed and retailers are looking to be more nimble, and you guys are driving a lot of innovation, can you talk about the process of maybe cutting out some unprofitable SKUs or the opportunity to do more of this, which obviously would have a sales impact, but also would be margin beneficial. So, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about that process. Thanks. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Thanks, Jason. So, we do this as we do everything on our business, systematically, and with an eye on the long-term, and we built this into our outlook and forecast. The process is pretty simple. Every business unit leader, general manager has an annual SKU reduction target. And then, we have a process in place that essentially looks at how incremental SKU is, how profitable SKU is, and then what you always do is cut the tail. What you always do is make other SKUs that are perhaps less profitable, more profitable through cost savings. It's always a source of creativity, and what you do is work with retailers to shift the mix towards the more profitable SKUs. Bleaches, perhaps another example where, and trash, where over the years, we've been tremendously successful to shift the mix, also enabled by innovation, towards more profitable SKUs. So, something that we routinely do and something that you should expect us to do on an ongoing basis. Certainly believe that, there continues to be an opportunity not just on Brita, but on all businesses to continue to do that. It's good business. Simplification is good. And it's part of our ongoing cost savings and margin improvement program. Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I'll turn it back to you for closing remarks. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yes. Thank you. All I really have to say is that I want to thank everybody who has been on the call, and I look forward to speaking with you again in February when we share our second quarter results. Thank you, and have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to The Clorox Company Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Managing Director of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. Lisah Burhan : Thanks, Evan. Welcome, everyone and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, Clorox\u2019 Chairman and CEO; and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019re broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com. Let me remind you that on today\u2019s call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliations with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today\u2019s press release, this webcast\u2019s prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the financial results of our website, as well as in our filings with SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today\u2019s earnings release. Please recognize that today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management\u2019s expectations and plans. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the impact of tax legislation. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management\u2019s expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. With that, I\u2019ll cover our Q2 business performance, discussing highlights in each of our segments. Steve will then address our financial results, as well as updated financial outlook for the year. Finally, Benno will close with his perspective followed by Q&A. For the total company, Q2 volume and sales each grew 1%, reflecting nearly a point of negative impact from the sale of Aplicare in August 2017. This is on top of very strong growth in the year ago quarter when volume increased 8% and sales grew 5%. In addition, sales were reduced by about 1 point from the combined impact of retailer inventory adjustment and lower shipments due to transportation carrier capacity constraints, both of which happened late in the quarter. Importantly, though, we saw tracked channel consumptions tracking well ahead of shipments late in the quarter and we do not expect a meaningful impact in the year from these events. I will now return to results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q2 volume grew 2% where sales grew 1%. We\u2019re pleased with these results, recognizing that for the segment, it includes about 2 points of negative impact from the sale of Aplicare and that we are lapping double-digit volume growth in the year ago quarter. Cleaning segment topline was led by Home Care, where volume and sales each grew by mid single-digit on top of double-digit volume growth and high-single digits sales growth in the year ago quarter. Growth in Home Care, which is our largest business unit, continues to reflect broad-based strength across The Clorox equity portfolio. This reflects yet another quarterly record for shipments of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes behind double-digit growth in the club channel, as well as from shipments of new Clorox Scentiva products. Consistent with these results, Home Care delivered its 14th consecutive quarter of market share gains. In our Laundry business, volume grew modestly on flat sales, following Q1 when retailers stock up for hurricane-related purchases. Recognizing this, we\u2019re pleased to see continued share gains in Clorox Liquid Bleach behind growth in our premium Clorox Splash-less Bleach, as well as the launch of new Clorox Performance Bleach with Cloromax. Lastly within the Cleaning segment, our Professional Products volume and sales declined driven by the sale of Aplicare. However, the balance of our Professional Products business continues to perform strongly. Turning to Household, Q2 volume was flat and sales decreased 3%, compared with a 12% sales increase in the year ago quarter, with gains in RenewLife more than offset by declines in other businesses. Starting with our Glad Bags and Wraps business, volume and sales declined mainly due to lower volume in the club channel, partially offset by continued strong growth in e-commerce. At the same time, we saw all-time record shipments of our premium OdorShield offerings, reflecting our focus on driving profitable growth in this higher margin segment. On the innovation front, we just started shipping new ForceFlex Plus advanced protection trash bag, our best trash bags yet, which features a reinforced bottom, leak guard technology, superior strength and guaranteed seven-day odor control. In our Charcoal business, volume and sales declined, following a double-digit increase in the year ago quarter. Now as a reminder, Q2 is a relatively small quarter for this business, representing less than 10% of the annual shipment. As we head toward growing season in the second half of this fiscal year, we\u2019re launching a new partnership with Major League Baseball, as well as new advertising. As a result, we continue to feel good about our plans for this business. Cat Litter volume and sales declined, driven partly by lower merchandising in the pet channel and a late in the quarter retailer inventory adjustment. We view these two factors as transitory and do not anticipate them to have meaningful impact on our plan for the full year. The business continues to have strong momentum behind our Fresh Step with Febreze innovation, resulting in a fifth consecutive quarter of market share growth. We\u2019re building on this momentum by launching Fresh Step Clean Paws Low Tracking Litter to address the biggest unmet consumer need in this category behind an exciting new and advanced technology. Finally, turning to RenewLife, volume and sales each grew by double digits and we\u2019re especially excited about the strong progress we\u2019ve made in the e-commerce channel, which is now a significant portion of this business. In our Lifestyle segment, volume and sales each increased 3%. Our Brita business volume and sales each grew by double digits, driven by strong club merchandising, as well as by our Stream pitcher and Long Last filter innovation. We\u2019re pleased with the positive impact our product innovation had in the first half of the fiscal year and remain focused on the long-term health of this business, as we continue to invest in brand building and innovation. Burt\u2019s Bees delivered volume and sales growth in Q2, largely due to all-time record shipments of lip care products, behind strong consumption and distribution gain. While still early, we continue to be excited about the rollout of our new cosmetics line. To conclude Lifestyle segment, food volume and sales declined, partly due to lower shipments of KC Masterpiece barbecue sauce, as well as a late in the quarter retailer inventory adjustment. Positively, overall, Hidden Valley consumptions remained healthy and the franchise continues to deliver share gains for the 12th consecutive quarter. Finally, turning to International, volume was flat, while sales grew 4%, mainly reflecting the benefits of pricing. We continue to focus on our Go Lean strategy to drive margin improvement in our International business, while selectively investing in Burt\u2019s Bees, RenewLife, Laundry and Home Care. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve, who will provide more information on our Q2 performance and discuss our updated outlook for the fiscal year. Steve Robb : Well, thanks, Lisah. And we\u2019re certainly pleased with our first half sales growth of 2%. Importantly, we are on track to deliver our full year sales outlook of 1% to 3%. Our brands are performing well and we feel good about the promising innovation in the second half. As we mentioned in our press release, we are facing elevated cost from commodities, and the tightening logistics market, which certainly impacted the second quarter and will continue through the balance of the fiscal year pressuring earnings. We believe we\u2019re taking the right actions to address these cost headwinds and build margin over the long-term. Importantly, we are very pleased with these significant expected benefits from Tax Reform. I\u2019ll take a moment to comment on what we\u2019re seeing as a result of Tax Reform before taking you through our second quarter results. As you know, Tax Reform brings significant changes, including the reduction of the U.S. corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the adoption of a modified territorial approach to taxation of foreign earnings and the elimination of certain tax benefits such as the domestic manufacturing deduction. The tax law is extensive and quite complex, and we\u2019re still working through all of its impacts, including updates for any changes to congressional, administrative or other policies, guidance or interpretations of the law. Now based on our current understanding of the tax law, we recorded approximately $81 million of tax benefits in the second quarter or an increase of $0.61 to earnings per share, which is the main driver for our second quarter effective tax rate of a minus 3% versus 34% in the year ago period. There are several aspects to Tax Reform that impacted our second quarter tax rate and these include $60 million benefit from the revaluation of our net federal deferred tax liability, $28 million of benefit to our current fiscal year taxable income from the reduction of the U.S. corporate federal income tax rate, these were partially offset by a $7 million one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings net of applicable foreign tax credits. Looking forward, for fiscal year 2018, based on our current understanding and analysis, we estimate our effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24%. Directionally, over the long-term, our tax rate is estimated to be in the mid-20s range. Bottomline, a lower tax rate moving forward is expected to significantly benefit our earnings and cash flows. As a result, we\u2019ll continue discussions with our Board of Directors on how best to deploy the increasing cash to enhance shareholder value, consistent with our cash allocation priorities, including growing our business and returning excess cash to shareholders. For more information, please refer to our 10-Q filing, which will be available later today. Now I\u2019ll take you through our financial results for the second quarter. Second quarter sales grew 1% on top of 5% in the year ago quarter, which includes about 1 point of volume growth and about 0.5 point of pricing, partially offset by over 1 point of unfavorable mix, reflecting strong club channel shipments. As a reminder, second quarter sales were negatively impacted by nearly 1 point from the Aplicare divestiture and about 1 point of combined impact from retail inventory adjustments and carrier supply constraints. Much of this volume is expected to ship in the third quarter. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, we expected gross margin to be under significant pressure in the quarter and it came in at 43%, a decrease of 170 basis points versus a year ago. These included 110 basis points of higher commodity costs, reflecting the hurricane-related pressures we discussed last quarter, as well as 90 basis points of higher logistics costs, driven in part by a further tightening of the transportation market. Importantly, consistent with our strategy, we invested about $8 million or 60 basis points in the future growth and cost savings programs. Second quarter gross margin also includes a benefit of 170 basis points from strong cost savings. Selling and administrative expenses were essentially flat versus year ago, and our advertising and sales promotion expenses increased $12 million versus the year ago quarter to about 10% of sales largely to support product innovation. Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.77, which includes the $0.61 of benefit from Tax Reform, earnings per share also reflects a reduction of $0.07 related to the incremental consumer demand building investments. Turning to fiscal year-to-date cash flow, net cash provided by continuing operations was $322 million versus $271 million in the year ago period, driven by lower employee incentive compensation payments. As we mentioned in our press release, Tax Reform had no impact on cash flows in the second quarter. Turning to our fiscal year 2018 outlook, as I mentioned, we continue to anticipate fiscal year sales growth to be between 1% and 3%. This includes about 3 points of incremental sales growth from our robust innovation programs, partially offset by nearly 1 point of negative impact from the Aplicare sale. Gross margin for the full year is now expected to be down modestly, reflecting even higher cost pressures related to commodities and logistics versus our previous assumptions. As a reminder, our previously communicated fiscal year outlook already reflected elevated costs, including significant pressures from the recent hurricanes. As a result of our updated assumptions, we now anticipate gross margin to be down in the third and fourth quarters, although not to the extent seen in the second quarter. Turning to our fiscal year 2018 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as we mentioned in the press release, we now expect fiscal year diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $6.17 to $6.37, an increase of 15% to 19% versus year ago and above the previous range of $5.47 to $5.67. This updated EPS range reflects an estimated benefit of $0.70 to $0.75 from Tax Reform and our expectations for lower gross margin in the second half. We\u2019ll be taking a close look at reducing selling and administrative expenses, and considering other planned adjustments to help address the pressures on our margins. I\u2019ll close by saying that we believe we have the right strategy in place to work through these challenges, investing strongly in our product and brand differentiation remains our top priority to keep our value proposition sharp. In addition, driving our cost savings and productivity initiatives will also consider additional price increases to support our margins, and we\u2019ll continue to drive our International Go Lean strategy to achieve operational efficiencies. And finally, as I mentioned earlier, as a result of Tax Reform, we are looking forward to partnering with our Board of Directors to review opportunities to deploy cash to further enhance shareholder value. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Benno. Benno Dorer : Thank you, Steve, and hello, everyone. Let me share with you my three key messages for today\u2019s call. First, we feel good about our first half results, execution and business fundamentals. We grew Q2 sales 1% on top of 5% in the year ago quarter, including the full impact of the Aplicare sale and the impacts from late quarter retailer inventory adjustments and transportation constraints. Now importantly with first half sales growth of 2%, we remain on track with a 1% to 3% sales growth target for the fiscal year. We were pleased to see track channel conception tracking ahead of shipments late in the quarter, and more recently, it appears that shipments delayed by carrier constraints have shifted into January. Importantly, execution and business fundamentals remain strong, and we continue to win with consumers and customers as evidenced by the following; year-over-year Household penetration, a critical metric continues to grow. On a 52-week basis at the end of the calendar year, 77% of our brand portfolio is growing or stable Household penetration, up from 46% just four years ago. The majority of our portfolio is also seen by consumers who is providing better value, supported by our strong innovation programs and this is critical in an environment where value is king. And finally, we have strong execution on pricing in the U.S. and international. Second, we\u2019re staying the course in our strategy, as we manage through a tougher cost environment. We remain committed to keep our business fundamentally strong and healthy, which remains job one in the face of higher cost environment in the U.S. We will keep playing offense and we will continue to do that by investing in differentiated products and brands, and with a solid innovation pipeline that aims to deliver 3 points of incremental sales growth in fiscal year \u201818. We will launch several meaningful margin-accretive innovations in the back half of the year, including the extension of our successful Clorox Scentiva platform into the Bathroom and Toilet Cleaning categories, as well as the rollout of Fresh Step Clean Paws Low Track Cat Litter and Glad trash bags (2013) with leak guard to innovations that address the biggest unmet needs in their respective categories with significant new technologies. With strong e-commerce sales and solid returns on investment for marketing, we are investing in demand creation focused on innovation and digital marketing to engage consumers online, and we are stepping up our focus on cost reduction and margin improvements. We\u2019re investing to lower the cost of our infrastructure and enable for us to grow such our new Atlanta West facility, which expands our self-manufactured Home Care capacity. We continue leading into waste reduction across our business to support margin expansion, including with our Go Lean strategy for international. And we\u2019re evaluating additional options to support margin improvement, including price increases, given the commodity cost environment. Third, Tax Reform is a significant and sustained benefit for Clorox shareholders. Our commitment to shareholder value creation is as strong as ever. Our priorities for uses of cash are business growth, including targeted M&A and returning excess cash to shareholders, and consistent with those priorities, we are actively progressing discussions with the Board to put Tax Reform benefits to work for shareholders in an expedient manner. So, in summary, while there are some near-term cost challenges for Clorox and others across our industry, we\u2019re pleased with our first half results and we\u2019re excited by the opportunities Tax Reform benefits bring to our business and to our shareholders. We continue to have confidence in the competitiveness of our 2020 Strategy and we\u2019re optimistic about our ability to deliver growth that\u2019s profitable, sustainable and responsible, as we aim to create shareholder value over the long-term. I\u2019d like to touch on one final and important topic before we go to Q&A, and that\u2019s our CFO transition. As you saw in our press release, Steve Robb has made the decision to retire after 29 years with the company. I know how much of you have enjoyed your interactions with him the past nearly seven years he served as our CFO. He\u2019s led Clorox through strong period of financial performance and during his tenure as CFO, Clorox total shareholder return has climbed 165%, ahead of the S&P 500 and well ahead of the 117% TSR growth for our peer group. We\u2019ve been fortunate to have such a strong leader on The Clorox team these many years. I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019ll personally miss Steve and I am incredibly grateful to have been able to work alongside such an exemplary leader and good friend over so many years. I am equally pleased that Steve in the company\u2019s commitment to leadership development and succession planning has enabled us to appoint such a capable and experienced leader as Kevin Jacobsen as our next CFO. Kevin has been with Clorox for 22 years and has held leadership positions across the company in finance. He\u2019s been actively and deeply involved in the day-to-day finance operations of the company and has worked closely with Steve and the executive team to shape and develop the company\u2019s financial and capital market strategies. He will join us on the call next quarter. We anticipate nothing less than a smooth transition and continuity. And I am pleased to Steve will stay on after March 31st in an advisory capacity through the end of the fiscal year. And with that, here\u2019s Steve to say a few parting words before we go to Q&A. Steve Robb : Thanks, Benno. Well, listen, it has certainly been my greatest privilege to have served as The Clorox Chief Financial Officer since 2011. And importantly, after 29 terrific years at the company, what I appreciate most are the relationships I\u2019ve established with so many people from different areas of our business, and of course, our Board of Directors and exceptional management team. I also very much enjoyed the many discussions I\u2019ve had with you and the rest of the investment community over the years. I\u2019ve always appreciated your insights, questions and certainly your candor. At the end of March, I\u2019ll be pleased to head over the reins to Kevin Jacobsen, a tremendous leader and a friend, who is supported by an outstanding finance organization. Clorox has the right strategy, as well as talented and passionate people who are always committed to doing the right thing for our shareholders and I leave feeling very good about the company\u2019s future. Thank you everyone. Benno Dorer : Thank you, Steve. And we\u2019ll now open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Dorer. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Steve Powers : Great. Thanks and congrats Steve. We\u2019ll miss you. Steve Robb : Thank you. Steve Powers : I am feeling actually lonely. There use to be three Steves on this call and now there\u2019s just me so. But we love working with Lisah, look forward to working with Kevin. Hey, so look, we\u2019ve talked a lot about net realized pricing dynamics on these calls over the course of time and the challenges that everyone in the industry is facing right now, just trying to hold on to pricing in the face of elevated competition, and obviously, lots of retailer pressure. I think we see in the results this quarter just with realized price mix down essentially 3% across the core Cleaning and Household segments and in the face of rising inputs, the obvious result is the challenges on gross margin trends that you cited. I guess, so just, as you look forward, what is the revised outlook on input cost trends that\u2019s in your outlook and how confident are you that pricing will be there, if input and transportation inflation surprises yet again on the upside, because it seems to be like a perpetual tension that we are -- that we grapple with on these calls? Steve Robb : Yeah. Thanks, Steve. Let me lead off on this. So, first, our outlook for commodity costs. Just to ground everyone, as I said in my opening comments, we anticipate that gross margin for the full year will be down modestly, included in that is about 1 point of commodity cost headwinds, that\u2019s our best estimate at this point. Now keep in mind, as I indicated on the previous earnings call that includes about $20 million of hurricane-related costs. Those certainly impacted our second quarter. I fully expect it will impact the third quarter, placing downward pressure on margins. But we do anticipate that over time, as we move through the fiscal year that should begin to dissipate. So some of the commodity costs, I think, are probably real and permanent. I think some of them related to the hurricane will likely dissipate. So what are we doing about it? Well, the first thing is, it\u2019s always about growth, profitable growth throughout renovation and we\u2019re certainly feeling very good about our innovation programs and how that\u2019s delivering for the company. The second has been cost savings. As I indicated, we did make some incremental investments in the second quarter to support our cost savings and growth initiatives, and I think, we feel very good about our three-year pipeline of cost savings initiatives. And then, finally, after doing those things, if we need to we\u2019re not afraid to take pricing. We took it on Disinfecting Wipes, it\u2019s still early days, but I will tell you, I think, it\u2019s going well and we feel like we\u2019ve got the strength and health in our brands, that if we need to take pricing to protect margins and continue investing back in the businesses, we\u2019ll do that. So, I think, we remain confident that over the very long-term that we\u2019ve got opportunities to continue to build margin. Benno Dorer : Yeah. Steve, this is Benno. Perhaps, one additional comment related to the ability to take pricing, which certainly seems to be an underlying part of your question. As Steve said, as cost continues to rise, we\u2019ll continue to assess additional pricing in the U.S. and international. And notably, we think that our innovation and strong marketing investments put us in a good position to do so. I\u2019d love to share with you some information that I have about price sensitivities, perhaps, as a way to build your confidence and make sure that you can share mine, price sensitivities on our brands today are lower than they were three years ago. And just a reminder, lower is better, over the last two years, price sensitivities decreased by 8%, whereas, importantly, on competitive brands they were up 7%. So that\u2019s a 15 point swing. That\u2019s pretty remarkable, and then, of course, as a result of the fact that we have brands that offer better value that we have invested in the business and that we have innovation. Importantly, also our price sensitivities in absolute are about 25% lower than those of competitors in this space. So when we look at major CPG brands in our and related categories, we compare ours against those and we\u2019re seeing significant benefit again, and that\u2019s of course, because the majority of our brands are seen as better value. So we have a strong track record executing price increases, obviously, we need to make sure that price increases should reassess them are cost justified. But we will certainly take a hard look and think that our brand certainly wants us being cautiously optimistic about taking pricing even in this environment than our Q2 pricing actions certainly has furthered that confidence. Steve Powers : Okay. And just to be clear, the price sensitivities that you\u2019re talking, is that just a measure of elasticity that you look at, what is that exactly? Benno Dorer : Yeah. That\u2019s hard data. Those are price elasticities. Steve Powers : Okay. Benno Dorer : And comes right out of our Analytics Department supported by an external supplier to make it extra objective so to speak. Steve Powers : Okay. And I guess just to technical cleanup questions probably for you, Steve. It sounds like the consumption is that -- the fact that consumption exceeded shipments, I think, by about a 1 point this quarter, it sounded like from your comments and from what Lisah upfront that you expect essentially that to come back in reverse in the third quarter as opposed to just the absorb, just want to make sure that\u2019s the right message? And then if you could just on the full year tax, it implies I think a tax rate, it implies a higher tax rate in the back half and is your expected go forward. So can you just help us just what the dynamics driving maybe a higher tax than what we\u2019ll see in fiscal \u201819 in the back half of \u201818, that would be helpful? Thank you. Steve Robb : Yeah. Sure. Let me start off, absolutely, late in the quarter we ran into some carrier constraints like I think everybody across many different industries. As a result, we had orders that just didn\u2019t shipped out, it was difficult in some instances to get drivers, we\u2019re taking actions to make sure that this doesn\u2019t repeat in the future. But it\u2019ll be challenging obviously in a tight transportation market. But in short we expect that most, if not all of that volume will come back in the third quarter and we certainly don\u2019t expect any meaningful impact on the full year based on what we know today, and of course, we will need to get through the third quarter to see that. As it relates to the tax rate? Yes, we do anticipate the full year effective tax rate, again based on our understanding of the Tax Reform Act to be about 23% to 24%, you\u2019re going to see a fair bit of variability across the quarters and even the halves, because remember it took a very large onetime gain or adjustment if you will on a provisional basis in the second quarter and we also had to true-up the first half tax rate in the second quarter. So as we get into the second half of the year, you\u2019re going to see difference there and you can probably just model it out. I would have you focus really on the full year tax rate and I would just one more time echo, that\u2019s based on our current understanding of what remains a very complex piece of legislation, but you\u2019re going to have some variability there. The most important thing and I think the biggest take away here, we have historically had an effective tax rate in the 30 -- low 30s to mid-30s and on a go forward we think it\u2019s in the mid-20s. So it\u2019s a really sizable reduction and theist just because more than 80% of our sales are in the U.S. So I think probably relative to many other companies, we will disproportionately benefit. It\u2019s going to help earnings and significantly step up the cash flow generation for the company in the coming quarters and years. And as Benno indicated, that\u2019s why we\u2019re partnering with the Board on things that we can do to enhance shareholder value around that. Steve Powers : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from John English from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jason English : Hey, folks. Jason here but you can call me John if you so choose. Okay. Good afternoon and thank you for the question. One quick clarifying question, the press release you mentioned sort of modest gross margin compression for the year, but in the prepared remarks talking about compression both the third and fourth quarters. I can\u2019t walk away thinking maybe your definition of modest is a bit different than mine. So can you quantify that, what does modest mean? Steve Robb : Jason, I almost want to ask you what your definition of modest is, but let me try this. When -- here is our perspective on gross margin for the year. Recognizing there is fair bit of volatility I think right now in both transportation and commodity markets. We think for the full year, gross margin will be down modestly. What does that mean, probably something less than a 1 point? When -- in particular, when we look at the third quarter and when we look at the fourth quarter, what we believe is that the hurricane-related costs will absolutely pressure margins significantly in the third quarter consistent with I had previously said. But when you look at the third quarter gross margin, it will be down less than you saw in the second quarter. And most importantly, when we look at the fourth quarter based on what we know, we think gross margin will be down but it will be down slightly to modestly, it\u2019s not going to be a large number and the reason for that is we\u2019ll work through those hurricane-related costs. In addition to that, we\u2019ve been making some fairly significant investments in our supply chain to drive future cost savings and as we get into the second half of the fiscal year, you\u2019ll see less of that. It doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not investing for the three-year pipeline, it\u2019s just how the investments are folding across the year. Jason English : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then I want to zoom in a little bit more on Glad. You mentioned the price increase you took and I think it was Waste business that sounds like it\u2019s going okay. Can you talk about the traction you\u2019re getting where you took some corrective actions on Glad and I believe when you took those corrective actions, you sort of reference setting the portfolio up from pricing architecture perspective for success on the next wave of innovation you are bringing. Maybe I missed it, but I didn\u2019t hear any comments on the next wave of innovation, can you give us any more color on what\u2019s coming down the pipeline there? Thank you. Steve Robb : Yeah. Jason, thanks. First of all, on the pricing action, as you remember correctly, we said that we\u2019re going to take down pricing at about 40% of the Glad trash portfolio, which is the part of our portfolio that is used by consumers to enter innovation, so that was of strategic importance. We look at that price decrease as to-date the successful and if you look at share results, what you can see over the most recent weeks is that the Glad trash business has returned to share growth. So, for what it\u2019s worth, that is something that we wanted to see and is happening, and an indicator of success. We did comment earlier on innovation on Glad trash that\u2019s being launched right now. It\u2019s our best trash bag yet that we call Glad ForceFlex Plus with advanced protection and if you think about Glad ForceFlex, it\u2019s the strongest bag in the category and consumer preferred, because it has a unique combination of strength and odor control. But the biggest unmet consumer need to-date was leakage protection, you pour food remnants, other things, plastic cups into trash bags, there\u2019s still liquid in it and then that liquid can leak. This is the first trash bag of its kind that addresses that consumer need and gives consumers leakage protection, and it\u2019s another example of a significant innovation, what we look at as game changing innovation, margin accretive game changing innovation, mind you coming out of our Glad joint venture. So pricing and innovation on Glad is a one-two punch, as anticipated and we look forward to seeing this rollout in the market right now, and have every indication that this is going to be another successful innovation on this business. Jason English : Thanks a lot guys. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. And I wanted to kind of go narrowing into the commentary about M&A or uses of cash that you added on the prepared remarks, and also in the press release. So I was just wondering what would be the kind of areas that you\u2019re looking for that would make sense in terms of like areas that you want to explore. In the past you have mentioned some of the Lifestyle, which you were successful with RenewLife or could we think about something bigger and more transformational? And Steve, we wish you all the best in the new phase of your life. Thank you. Steve Robb : Well, thank you, Andrea. I appreciate that. Let me provide a perspective. First for all, again, we\u2019re excited by Tax Reform. A couple of things are true from a company investment standpoint. I would say U.S. assets, whether its investments in infrastructure, cost savings projects and even M&A are much more attractive today than they were before this was passed late December. And the reason for that, obviously, is the fact that we\u2019ve got a 14 point reduction of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and it just means you\u2019ve got more cash flows from all of those projects. So what I feel good about is, we\u2019ve always invested behind our brands, our businesses. We\u2019ve invested to keep that cost savings pipeline healthy. We\u2019re going to stay the course on that. We\u2019re also going to stay the course on being discipline. All of that said, we will continue as we always have to really look for good opportunities for investment. Our focus on M&A remains unchanged. We\u2019re open to anything that\u2019s in the best interest of shareholders. What do we like? We like businesses in the U.S. That\u2019s probably even more true today than it was a few months ago. We also like businesses with tailwinds that are margin accretive, asset light and things that are in categories, where we think we have right to win and could drive shareholder value. So, all of this remains completely unchanged. Now what\u2019s also though as we were starting to build up excess cash and we -- and I think we\u2019ve talked to the investment community and to our Board before about that, we need to start the process of returning excess cash to shareholders. I think Tax Reform just adds to that and so we probably have even more cash to think about returning. And if you look at our cash allocation priorities, the first is to support our business. The second is the dividend and for more than 40 years, we\u2019ve increased the dividend, and so the dividend is the number two priority. The third has been debt and I would just say that our targeted debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 2% to 2.5%. We\u2019re sitting at about 1.7%, 1.8%. I think last quarter it was 1.8%. So we feel good about that in share repurchases. So that\u2019s why I think Benno in his comments and my comments, we have really focused on continue investing for growth, both organically and inorganically, and then look for ways to return cash to shareholders and that\u2019s going to continue to be our focus. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. So if I can just ask you something about SG&A savings that you talked about as a way to mitigate this discretion on the -- kind of like more on the cost side. What should we be thinking, because obviously you\u2019re increasing and you reached a certain level of investments in E&P, are you looking more on kind of rationalization of your processes, what is exactly that kind of SG&A saving program? Steve Robb : Yeah. Well, we have taken a very disciplined approach for many years to SG&A management. I think before many companies were doing is zero based budgeting we had been focusing on this. What we do is we apply our cost savings methodologies to SG& A as a way of taking out cost that the consumer doesn\u2019t value or they don\u2019t benefit the company and its shareholders in some way and I think we\u2019ve had a nice track record of really bringing that number down below 14%. I just think in this difficult cost environment, we are going to take a look at discretionary expenditures where you can always make choices and whether to spend or not, where it\u2019s not going to hurt the brands, it\u2019s not going to hurt the company or our people. So it will be a continuation of what we\u2019ve been doing, but we\u2019re probably going to lean in a bit harder to that to see how we can mitigate some of the near-term inflationary pressures certainly from these hurricanes. So it\u2019s what any good discipline company I think we tried to do in situation where you\u2019re facing some near-term cost challenges. Andrea Teixeira : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Bonnie Herzog : All right. Hi, everyone. I am -- I had a question on the $14 million incremental demand driving investments in the quarter that you called out to support your product innovation. I guess I am just trying to better understand how and where this money was spent and was this more one-time investment or do you guys plan to increase your investment levels going forward? And then, historically, when you\u2019ve stepped up demand building investments, how much of a lag has there been between the investment spend and then accelerating topline growth? Steve Robb : Yeah. Thanks, Bonnie. So, first of all, I want to say, so this $14 million are not related to Tax Reform. So this is not an indication of our assessment that we need to step up spending. You will recall that we have stepped up spending already over the last three years systematically and based on strategy, and that\u2019s where it\u2019s very well for us, and we\u2019ve also commented more recently that we\u2019re generally happy with the amount of advertising sales promotion and demand spending in general that we have put in place and that we do not see a need to increase that, based on what we know today that\u2019s still our assessment. So I would look at those $14 million versus year ago as a planned investments that coincides with innovation. This fiscal year we\u2019ve always said that advertising sales promotion spend by quarter will vary, but we\u2019re not taking up our estimate for the total year or for future years at this point, we think we\u2019re pleased with the amount of demand investment that we put in place. So this -- that the bulk of the dollars went after innovation to support speed to shelf and awareness. So there is a time lag behind it. This does not all lead to an increase in sales in the first quarter. We should look at this investment as investment that will benefit the back half, because all of it went into equity building, awareness building, types of things on the various innovations that we\u2019ve launched. Notably Burt\u2019s Bees, and perhaps, Clorox and Scentiva, and the Fresh Step platform being three examples of where we see success and where we feel bullish and where we want to support these innovations with advertising sales promotion. Perhaps, lastly, so I said this earlier, we\u2019ll keep playing offense. We love our strategy, we\u2019re confident in our strategy, we are winning with consumers and customers, and when we see investments just like we saw last quarter, opportunities to invest in advertising sales promotion and in gross margin to support cost savings and projects that will deliver future cost savings. We will do that, because we manage our business for the total year, and for the long-term and not to lend our number for the quarter in a certain place. We will take -- continue to take a strategic approach and these $14 million are part of that. Bonnie Herzog : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And I know you\u2019ve mentioned in the past that your focused on the investments is towards the faster growing categories, and one, that you highlighted this morning again is Burt\u2019s Bees, sounds like it\u2019s doing really well and you highlighted lipsticks. So any more color there and how that\u2019s working? And then could you touch on international opportunities and where you\u2019re at with that for Burt\u2019s Bees? Thank you. Benno Dorer : Yes. So we continue to like Burt\u2019s Bees and cosmetics is early, but we are excited about this. We started to expand that line in the last quarter. That will continue this quarter. We\u2019re not done per end of December. So it\u2019s a phased rollout that will coincide with retailers shelf reset dates, so Q3 will continue. So I am excited about this, but I also say, I am as excited about the growth that we\u2019re seeing on base -- lip care. Lip balm has seen strong double-digit growth last quarter. Its growing market share and one thing we\u2019ve always done well on Burt\u2019s Bees is to expand into new categories, but do so with discipline and by discipline we mean not compromising on the core business, and that\u2019s of course, why we\u2019ll keep the focus on lip balm up. International continues to be a solid opportunity for us. We\u2019re in more than 35 countries now and we continue to see good success innovating and expanding distribution in many International markets, focus more recently has been in Asia and we\u2019ve commented that we have used the e-commerce platform as a way to enter Mainland China through Alibaba\u2019s Tmall platform and that\u2019s going well, and we think that that has continued potential. So feel good about Burt\u2019s Bees both in the U.S., as well as in International. Bonnie Herzog : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kevin Grundy : Thanks. Good afternoon and I want to extend my congratulations also to Stephen and Kevin. So, best wishes to both of you. I wanted to point of clarification on the sales growth guidance. So you\u2019re mentioning the 1% to 3% year-over-year sales growth. That includes 1 point track from Aplicare, but the FX guidance and I apologize if I missed this, it was previously a 1 point headwind but the dollar has weakened now, so that should be seemly probably flat or maybe even a little bit of a help. So I was hoping you could comment broadly on your expectations for the company from a volume and price mix perspective, has that changed at all since you last updated your guidance? And then it doesn\u2019t sound like Benno anything has changed from a category growth perspective. You sound pretty encouraged based on what you\u2019re seeing with the POS data, understanding there\u2019s a little bit of a delta there between shipments and the POS late in the quarter, but maybe you could touch on that and sort of wrapped that into this answer as well? Thanks. Benno Dorer : Yeah. Maybe I\u2019ll start there and then Steve can answer the first part of your question. Yeah, fundamentals are pretty solid and categories are quite healthy. If you look at the tracked channels, category growth is hovering right at above 1%, that\u2019s unchanged and in line with our expectations and actually quite healthy. And I think you all know that non-tracked channel is where the growth really is. So the growth there is stronger than 1%. So we feel good about where we are on categories. It\u2019s too early to say what Tax Reform will bring, certainly the economy is picking up and if you look at the consumer fundamentals whether that\u2019s consumer confidence, whether that\u2019s unemployment, whether that\u2019s overall consumer spend, they all look pretty good. The question now is will it translate into our categories and we\u2019ll have to see about that. But a stable consumer environment and category environment is good for us and that\u2019s certainly what we\u2019re seeing right now. Steve Robb : And just from sales outlook standpoint, we are thinking it remains fairly unchanged, it\u2019s consistent with what we talked about in the last quarter. We still believe we are solidly in this 1% to 3% range, of course, fiscal year-to-date we\u2019ve got 2%, obviously, we were a little disappointed that we had the carrier transportation and other issues late in the quarter, but that volume will come back in the third quarter based on what we can see. And so I would say, generally, we\u2019re on track, innovation at 3 points looks good, Applicare is pretty much a known you can just do the math on that. Fair enough on FX, you\u2019ve always got some puts and takes on that. We have to see how that plays out for the rest of the year. But when I look at FX, price mix and just all that other stuff, it\u2019s pretty been a much a wash, and again, let\u2019s get to the next couple of quarters, but feeling confident in our sales outlook. Kevin Grundy : Okay. Thanks. Just one quick follow up, this is on Steve Powers question earlier. Just really succinctly, is your impression now that retailers are more receptive to pricing here is -- it seemed are we waiting for wages to start to come up and more profound way? I mean, clearly, logistics costs are up and fashion costs are up, but the quarters have been what they\u2019ve been for your peers and for you guys from a margin perspective. Have we reached a sort of tipping point here where you do feel like we\u2019ll start to see pricing take hold, maybe not just in your categories, but more broadly? Thanks for the follow up. Benno Dorer : I can\u2019t really comment on what\u2019s happening more broadly. I don\u2019t think I am -- it would be wise for me to comment. Taking pricing is not easy these days. But I think if you have market leading brands, if you invest in brand equities, if you have solid category growth, if your brands are performing well, if you have innovation, we feel like the data suggests and I quoted price sensitivities should cost justify that we are certainly assessing whether it\u2019s the right thing to do for us to get back. We have certainly shown on Clorox Disinfecting Wipes last quarter that we can do successful -- pricing successfully. We\u2019ve also shown that we can do that in the past and I would say, certainly, if you think about categories, category growth is important for retailers, pricing often has been part of a successful recipe to grow categories and retailers probably know that. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s easier today, to be honest and it certainly not easy for everybody, but thinking about our fundamentals on the business, it certainly looks like we\u2019re in the best possible position relative to others to do that, should we decide that we will. Kevin Grundy : Thanks, Benno. Good luck. Operator : Our next question comes from Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Olivia Tong : Great. Thanks and congrats to Steve and Kevin. In terms of the discussions that you\u2019re having with your Board about reinvesting some of that tax benefit back, where do you think your deficiencies lie, like can you give us some color into what you\u2019re considering more advertising, more in-store, people investments to build out capabilities, things like that? Steve Robb : Well, again, Olivia, I guess, I would just remind everyone that one of the hallmarks of our 2020 Strategy and what we\u2019ve done successfully over the last couple of years is we\u2019ve significantly stepped up consumer demand building investments. You look at our fixed capital investments, that\u2019s been stepped up to support both growth and cost savings. So I actually feel good about the investments we\u2019ve been making. Of course, we\u2019ll take a hard look to make sure in light of Tax Reform if there\u2019s even more that we can be doing, but I don\u2019t want to leave you with the impression that, because of Tax Reform that there\u2019s going to be a significant shift there, but we\u2019ll always take a hard look. I think the biggest opportunity is to take a hard look at excess cash generation and look for ways to get that back to our shareholders and we have plenty of capacity, both in terms of borrowing capacity, while staying disciplined within our range, as well as just cash flow capacity to invest behind the business. So we\u2019re in a very good spot, because of the balance sheet, because of the cash flows and now Tax Reform to be able to invest for growth, as we\u2019ve been doing, but also return cash to shareholders and those are the discussions we\u2019re having with the Board. Olivia Tong : Got it. And I guess, specifically to Cleaning, you mentioned in the -- you mentioned the price actions on Glad, but what about wipes? I mean, because I thought that should have been already started to get reflected in Q2, yet the price mix was -- the price was down in Cleaning. So has that been implemented? What\u2019s the competitive reaction been so far to those actions and do you still expect price to be a contributor in that specific division this year? Lisah Burhan : Olivia, it\u2019s Lisah. So CDW, Clorox Disinfecting Wipes pricing and Cleaning, this quarter is actually only about a month or so, maybe a little over a month, so we did see some lift. But more importantly though as you see the results of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, we\u2019re still growing double digits in some channels. So again to Benno\u2019s point, strength of our brands here. I hope that answers your question. Olivia Tong : Yeah. It does. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Altobello from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Joe Altobello : Thanks. Good morning, guys. So first question I guess for Steve. Just curious if there\u2019s any thought given to sticking out year and calling it an even 30 at Clorox? Steve Robb : Well, keep in mind, it\u2019s been more than 29 years and I am going to stay on as Benno said, as an adviser to this company that I love so much at the end. So I\u2019ll be getting pretty close to that 30-year mark. Joe Altobello : Hopefully you get a watch at 30-year mark. And here is my question, I guess, first, did you actually quantify the impact from delayed shipments and the retailer inventory reductions in the quarter? Steve Robb : Yeah. We certainly did that in our opening comments. Our best estimate, of course, this is a little bit challenging to measure, but we think it\u2019s about 1 point to sales growth and so if you think of where the sales came in for the quarter, if you\u2019re looking at the way the quarter was unfolding, we were very much on track to have about an incremental point versus what we reported, but because of some of the retailer inventory adjustments, as well as the transportation challenges, that point never happened, but we think optimistically is likely to occur in the third quarter, so no impact on the full year. Joe Altobello : So part of that point should come back we the delayed shipments that obviously should have happened around January? Steve Robb : Yeah. Yeah. Joe Altobello : But does the inventory reductions ease, are you seeing that or has that not happened yet? Benno Dorer : Yeah. Joe, first of all, Steve reassured me that his 29 years felt more like 30. So, I think, we\u2019ve got that covered. We think that some of it will come back, but not all of it will come back. But, clearly, our brands turn fast and turn routinely. So, typically when inventories get too low, there is an upward adjustment. We think we\u2019re seeing some of it come back, but perhaps, not all of it, but as Steve said, there is not going to be material for the fiscal year and in the grand scheme of things, it\u2019s end of quarter noise, which is unfortunate but a reality, but for the total fiscal year, will be a no factor. Joe Altobello : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just one last housekeeping item, the $6 million in other income in the quarter, what was that related to? Steve Robb : Yeah. You\u2019re talking about the 6 -- yeah, well, the biggest thing I would say to other income and expense, if you\u2019re talking about our year-over-year change, as a reminder, it was just a $21 million charge that we took in the year ago period, that was a non-cash charge on the Aplicare, that\u2019s the biggest swing, the rest is just small puts and takes. Joe Altobello : Okay. Perfect. Thanks, guys. Congratulations Steve. Take care. Steve Robb : Thank you, Joe. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Ali Dibadj : Hi, guys. So I had a few questions. One was just around EBIT margin, trying to help me -- help us quantify how much it actually would be down. So gross margin clearly not going to be positive. I do wonder, maybe you can help as you answer the question talk about the supplier constraints. I mean, how do you do that? How do you release that constraint unless you pay more, I guess, so I wonder whether the gross margin pressure is even greater, so I don\u2019t know how gross margin, obviously, is going to be negative. And on the SG&A, it\u2019s down modestly, so down 10 basis points roughly, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s modest or another word, but that\u2019s down a little bit, and you\u2019re already below the 14% level, so I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s more room to grow. So, I guess, EBIT margin, couple of quarters ago, you said it\u2019s going to be up, flat and I am just trying to get a sense of how you think about it? How much it should be down given the pressures on gross margin and SG&A, as well as you\u2019re going to advertise a little bit more it sounds like at least in the investment business? Steve Robb : So, Ali, this is Steve. Let me -- you got a couple of questions here. Let me see if I can answer each one in turn. First let me comment about logistics, because you brought up an important point. The logistics market is tightening. In short, there\u2019s just not enough equipment, but more importantly, people to move loads in some routes. So I think our folks very much understand the issue. It\u2019s an industry-wide issue. It\u2019s not just tied to Clorox. I do think that will put upward pressure on logistics costs. We try to reflect that in this outlook. That\u2019s one of the reasons gross margin will now be down modestly. But importantly, we\u2019re also partnering with those companies that we work with to make sure that we\u2019ve got the equipment and the people when we need it at the right time, so that we can obviously get the orders moved out. So not to say that it will be without challenges, but at least in this outlook we think we have properly captured as best we can the incremental cost associated with that and we are making changes in operating plans to ensure good execution as we\u2019ve always had for many, many years. As it relates to SG&A expenses, I would point to two things. One, again, just general belt-tightening, the kinds of things you do when you face near-term cost challenges. I think the other thing is incentive compensation is going to be a bit less, because with these incremental cost pressures, obviously, our margins, gross margin and EBIT margin are going to be less than what we thought and there\u2019s been some impacts, obviously, to earnings. So that will have the effect this year of lowering SG&A a bit as well. As far as EBIT margin, again, I would just circle back to gross margin. I think, again, it\u2019s down modestly or something less than point is probably the right way to think of the year. Long-term, we\u2019re absolutely committed to both gross margin and EBIT margin expansion in the range of 25 bps to 50 bps, but I just think this year with the commodity cost increases, the hurricanes, logistics market is going to be tougher. But, again, that\u2019s why we\u2019re making the long-term investments in innovation, growth and cost savings. Ali Dibadj : So EBIT margin in line with gross margin, modestly down is how you would think about it? Steve Robb : Yeah. I haven\u2019t provided outlook for that, Ali, as you can see, but I\u2019ll let you do the math. But if you just again, take our 1% to 3% sales gross margin\u2026 Ali Dibadj : Yeah. Steve Robb : \u2026 modestly. Ali Dibadj : Okay. Steve Robb : I think you can probably do the math on the range. Ali Dibadj : Okay. So then on the 1% to 3% sales, I want to zero in on the negative 3% in Household this quarter aligned with a zero volume as well. I mean the price reductions in the Bags and Wraps was relatively downplayed, I would say, certainly last quarter in our own questioning, but even at the Analyst Day, start off with just one SKU at the Analyst Day and then it was well maybe something else given competitive pressures. And I just wonder whether there\u2019s relief coming or is it just going to spread in terms of pricing, given some of the commentary from before has shifted to where we are today? So more comfort there and I get the market share point, Benno, you raised a second ago, we are okay, market share finally. But what does mean from pricing and competitive pricing as well in that market for that segments specifically? Steve Robb : Yeah. Ali, first of all, on the Glad price increase I want to confirm that there was no change midway to our plans. So and there was nothing related to increasing competitive pressures? So plan price increase on about 40% of the volume, that\u2019s what we did to enable innovation. We executed that well, shares coming back, so we feel good about that. And now, of course, innovation is going to hit in this quarter and we feel great about that. So we feel good about Glad overall. I\u2019d look at the Household segment and I\u2019d just stare at a 12% growth last year and 3% decline on a 12% growth, even though you never want to see segment sales decline. The net of it over two years is still positive and then if I double click on the business, we just talk Glad and Glad is a very important business for us and we feel good about where we are. Litter was affected by said retailer inventory adjustments, but of course, we feel good about the growing shares in litter and the category growth in litter, and now importantly, also significant innovation that\u2019s going to come out this quarter, which is our best tested innovation that we\u2019ve ever had on this business. So we\u2019ve been on a run in litter and we think we can keep going. Charcoal was down, yes, but again, off of a double-digit increase last year and also in a quarter that\u2019s by far the slowest mover given the winter season in that category and RenewLife is up double digits, doing particularly well in e-commerce, for prospective, a year ago, e-commerce on that business was 4% of sales. This last quarter, it was 20% of sales, which shows you that our continued efforts to invest and be a leader in e-commerce are bearing fruit and in 2018 we will be able to add innovation to that business. We are launching a line of non-GMO and organic probiotics, the first of its kind on RenewLife and we\u2019re also launching a kids line for all kids development stages, which is an important consumer need and something we\u2019re excited about. So if I look at the individual businesses and how I feel in the Household segment, I can\u2019t help but feel good and optimistic. Ali Dibadj : Okay. Last question, do you feel the same about International in terms of the trends there, I mean, clearly, pricing was good, volume was just flat, Asia and Latin America still in a little bit more pain, you had been on this trajectory of improving margins there and a little bit rough for now. How do you feel similarly about International, which does especially Asian and Latin American volumes were less a little bit? Benno Dorer : Yeah. I feel not -- that in international, we\u2019re not yet where we want to be. We\u2019ve had number of really solid quarters. This was an okay quarter. But, clearly, cost continues to be challenged, because we\u2019re seeing continued inflation. FX also is still a headwind. We\u2019re looking at Argentina, and which of course, is the biggest -- a big market for us internationally and that recovery in their economy is progressing but requires a lot more time. So, with International, I would say, we\u2019re doing everything that we can control, which is to Go Lean, which is to invest selectively in profitable growth opportunities, save costs, drive business towards higher margin initiatives well. But we\u2019re doing that in a continued very difficult macroeconomic environment and for that business to do, as well as we want to, we need that macroeconomic environment to ease up and we haven\u2019t seen that in Q2. Steve Robb : And Ali, this is Steve, if I can just build on Benno\u2019s comments, as it relates to at least the earnings when you look at the reported decrease, just a perspective. It represents about $5 million decrease to earnings on a year-over-year basis, well over half of that was actually decisions we made in the quarter to step up consumer demand building investments and then the balance was just some of the cost pressures and investments we\u2019re making around Go Lean. So, you have to put that in context as well. There\u2019s going to be variability across margins and profitability in that business. But I do think we\u2019re taking the right long-term actions to keep that moving in the right direction. Ali Dibadj : Okay. Thanks a lot and congrats again Steve. Steve Robb : Thanks, Ali. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Gere from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jason Gere : Okay. Good afternoon and Steve best of luck. I will make this very brief. I guess the one thing that I wanted to talk a little bit more was on the advertising budget that you\u2019re set for this year. So can you maybe talk -- in the context of the competitive environment, are you seeing anything in any of your categories where you have to shift some of your advertising towards gross to net, is there anything out there that would prohibit that and then just with the rising cost inflation, do you think that you would definitely see the gross to net actually start to come down a little bit, because everyone\u2019s trying to get more price realizations. So I was wondering if maybe you can just talk about where we should be thinking about advertising for the year and relative to gross to net impact that would be in the gross margin? Thank you. Benno Dorer : Yeah. So we have, Jason, in the past commented on advertising sales promotion being about 10% of net sales and we think that that\u2019s the right number. I -- again, taxes don\u2019t make a difference to that and the competitive environment has not changed. So we feel like it\u2019s a solid number to deliver our sales growth that we have in our outlook. In terms of trade spend, we have as you know over the last three years stepped it up in particular to support innovation, so that\u2019s strategic spend, some of it was related to elevated competitive activity in certain categories like Wipes. But most of it to support product innovation, so that\u2019s good spend. That\u2019s maybe one where over time, long-term there may be an opportunity for that to perhaps go the other way and go down, because whenever you step up spending, what you do as a next step and that\u2019s certainly been the hallmark for our company is to look at the effectiveness of every single dollar, you learn and then you learn that perhaps there\u2019s opportunity you to optimize and then you optimize. So I think that for the coming fiscal years there\u2019s got to be opportunities for us to optimize that and then either increase the ROI between the existing spending or perhaps take that down, that remains to be seen. But advertising sales promotion, unless something significant happens in the marketplace, is exactly where we want it to be. It will continue to vary by quarter, but for the total fiscal year it\u2019s about in the right place. Jason Gere : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead. Shirley Serrao : Hi. Good morning. This is actually Shirley Serrao on behalf of Lauren Lieberman. Just wanted to dig a little bit deeper into some of the volume strengths in Lifestyle, I noticed double-digit volume gains in water filters, so just sort of the first positive data point we\u2019ve seen on volumes in that category in a while. So just some details there around initiatives you pursued in the quarter and any early read on some of the innovations that have come through? Thank you. Lisah Burhan : Hey, Shirley. How are you? This is Lisah. So, Brita, as we said in the scripts, my opening remarks today, it\u2019s really club strength that we saw, and importantly, it\u2019s due to innovation that we have, as you know, we launched our new Stream pitcher couple of quarters ago and recently also Long Last filter innovation and both have really made a difference in the category growth, as well as our shares. Shirley Serrao : Great. Thank you and good luck Steve. Steve Robb : Thank you. Shirley. Lisah Burhan : So we will take one more question. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge. Please go ahead. Jonathan Feeney : Thanks so much. Steve, Kevin, congratulations. I wanted to first ask two questions. First, Benno, in historical, I know you know a little bit about history of Glad and how these things tend to go, and historically, I\u2019ve noticed in the data that considering the magnitude and surprising magnitude of resin, raw material price increases generally, the cadence of private label price increase seems to be pretty slow. I am wondering how -- historically, how long does it take for pricing to from higher commodities make its way through the category? Just from your past experience, I know you don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to happen this time, just some perspective on that would be helpful? And secondly, I think, Google Trends has flu searches up 400% year-over-year. I am wondering if historically, flu scares like we have right now have had any major impact on your business. It\u2019s certainly been something you\u2019ve talked about, I think, Steve has talked about at CAGNY several times as a theme for your company and a way of marketing your products. I wonder if you\u2019re having any either interest of retailers or increased takeaway at this point? Thank you. Benno Dorer : Yeah. On resin and pricing, Jonathan, so, first of all, we\u2019re not in a coffee industry where we passed through goodness and we take pricing right away. So there is a time lag and it all depends on what price, resin cost plateau we are expecting. So we\u2019re pricing strategically. We\u2019re pricing with an eye on the mid-term and we price depending on future expectations, as well as the actual cost development. So really depends, I can tell you that, we\u2019re looking at where cost is right now, which is certainly elevated, but importantly, we\u2019re looking at where cost is expected to be mid-term over the next six months to 12 months and we need to believe that both of it is going to be up or stay up significantly as a way to justify pricing. We\u2019re able to execute pricing when we execute pricing and certainly we have done that on this business and other businesses in the past, with some lead time, it does require planning with customers and that takes months time. So I don\u2019t think about this is something that is just done in a snap and with a switch of a button. So there is lead time associated with it, because pricing for us is strategic matter and doing it right means giving it some lead time. On flu season, so we think that may have been a tiny a little bit in Q2 but not much. Certainly, Disinfecting Wipes grew almost double digits, high-single digits, double digits in the club channel. We also saw market shares up on Clorox Bleach, which of course, offers disinfecting properties and Clorox Clean-Up spray, which is also a disinfectant. So there\u2019s certainly strength in that our disinfecting category as consumers still look to us to help them with products that help them get rid of germs. But its -- I don\u2019t think that it was materially on Q2, Q3 it\u2019s a little early to say. Typically February, of course, is another peak season. There are typically two peak months in the flu season, that\u2019s November and February, so we\u2019re entering February remains to be seen. What I can tell you is that we\u2019re planning every season with our customers as if it is flu season and we have enough product in store and enough capacity also to be able to fully supply should there be increased demand, but it\u2019s just a little early. But we see what you see it, certainly an elevated flu season and we\u2019re able to react and supply customers and consumers should we need to. Jonathan Feeney : Thank you. Steve Robb : Thanks. Benno Dorer : So, I think that\u2019s it. Thank you, everyone, and I look forward to speaking with all of you again in May when we share our third quarter results. Have a good weekend. Operator : That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect.",

Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Clorox Company Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Release Conference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Managing Director of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.: Thanks, Stephanie. Welcome, everyone. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, our Chairman and CEO, and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com. On today's call, we'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA, and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliations with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available on our website as well as in our SEC filings. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release. Please also recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the impact of tax legislation. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. With that, let me cover our Q3 performance, discussing highlights in each one of our segments. Kevin will then address our financial results as well as updated outlook for the fiscal year. Finally, Benno will offer his perspective and we'll close with Q&A. For the total company, Q3 volume and sales each grew 3%. We grew sales in all four segments, offsetting nearly a point of negative impact from Aplicare divestiture. These results were on top of very strong growth in the year-ago quarter when volume increased 7% and sales grew 4%. Now, I'll turn to our results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q3 volume grew 4%, where sales grew 3%. Cleaning segment top line growth was led by Home Care, where volume and sales each grew by high-single digits on top of double-digit volume and sales growth in the year-ago quarter. Volume in Home Care was broad based with record quarterly shipments of several Clorox-branded products, including Clorox disinfecting wipes. Following implementation of recent price increase, our disinfecting wipes business still reported double-digit volume growth, emphasizing the strength of the Clorox brand. Contributing to the growth were gains from new product innovation, strong merchandising as well as shipments related to a severe cold and flu season. Consistent with these results, Home Care delivered its 15th consecutive quarter of market share gains. In our Laundry business, volume and sales declined, primarily due to softness in the sodium hypochlorite bleach category. At the same time, as we trade consumers up to higher dollaring items in this category, as well as other bleach-based product in our Home Care business, we're pleased to see continued share gains in Clorox liquid bleach behind our premium Clorox Splash-Less Bleach as well as the launch of new Clorox Performance Bleach with CLOROMAX. Lastly, within the Cleaning segment, our Professional Products sales declined due to the Aplicare divestiture which occurred in August 2017. Excluding the impact of Aplicare, sales grew double digits from new product innovation, strong e-commerce growth and incremental shipments of cleaning products behind the cold and flu season. Turning to Household segment, Q3 volume grew 3% and sales grew 1%, with growth in Cat Litter, largely offset by a decline in cold due to poor weather throughout the quarter. Starting with our Cat Litter business, volume and sales grew double digits, driven by core strength in the business as well as our new Clean Paws innovations, which we're now also supporting with a national marketing campaign. This business continued to have strong momentum behind our Fresh Step with Febreze innovation platform and this was our sixth consecutive quarter of market share growth. In our Glad bags and wraps business, volume and sales grew, primarily driven by strong trash bag volume in the club channel. Consistent with our strategy on this business, we saw all-time record shipments of our premium OdorShield offerings, reflecting our focus on driving profitable growth in this higher margin segment. In February, we turned on advertising for our new ForceFlex Plus Advanced Protection trash bags, which featured a reinforced bottom, leak guard technology, superior strength and guaranteed seven-day odor control. In our Charcoal business, volume and sales decreased, driven by the coldest and snowiest January through March in the last several years. Simply put, it was the snowiest March in 25 years which is certainly not favorable for Charcoal, especially in early spring. This issue negatively impact the entire Charcoal category, driving consumption down double digits for the quarter. For perspective, this resulted in nearly 1 point of negative impact to our total company sales in Q3. Since then, we've seen a challenging start to the Charcoal business in Q4, given retailer inventory carryover from Q3, as well as the continuation of poor weather into April. That said, we're focused on executing our plans for our fourth and largest quarter of the year. We're leaning into new partnership with Major League Baseball, turning on our marketing programs for the grilling season and we're working with our retail partners to add additional in-store events notably around key holidays. Finally turning to RenewLife, volume and sales decreased this quarter due in part to challenges driven by significant orders towards the end of Q2 that depleted our inventories and from a temporary supply challenge resulting from a product pack size conversion. We fully anticipate returning to sales growth in the fourth quarter and we remain excited about the progress we're making in the e-commerce channel as well as bringing innovation to the category, such as our new organics and kits line. In our Lifestyle segment, volume was flat and sales increased 2%, with gains in Food and Burt's Bees, partially offset by declines on Brita. Burt's Bees delivered volume and sales growth in Q3, largely due to record quarterly shipments of lip care products behind strong consumption and innovation, as well as record quarterly shipments of face care products behind innovation and distribution gains. We're continuing the multi-quarter rollout of our new color cosmetics lines and we're encouraged by the power of Burt's Bees equity and the consumer's desire for natural products in makeup. Food volume and sales grew driven by all-time record shipments of Hidden Valley salad dressings. Consumption is healthy and the franchise delivered share gains for the 13th consecutive quarter. To conclude the Lifestyle segment, Brita volume and sales declined following last quarter's double-digit volume and sales growth. The decline was partly due to a merchandising event shift and lapping the launch of Stream Pitcher and Longlast Filter innovations in the year-ago quarter. Finally, turning to International, volume was up 3%, while sales grew 4%, mainly reflecting the benefits of pricing. We continue to focus on our Go Lean strategy to drive margin improvement in our International business. At the same time, we're selectively investing in portions of our Laundry and Home Care businesses as well as RenewLife and Burt's Bees. These are businesses that are margin accretive, have tailwinds and where we believe we have a strong right to win. We're pleased to see the areas we're investing in growing, such as Burt's Bees which reported double-digit volume and sales growth this quarter. Now, I'll turn it over to Kevin who will discuss our Q3 financial performance and updated outlook for the fiscal year. Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Thank you, Lisah. We're pleased to deliver another solid quarter of volume and sales growth with sales increases in all four of our segments. As we mentioned in our press release, we've updated our fiscal year outlook for two main reasons. First, our outlook now reflects the impact of the Nutranext acquisition, which closed last month. Second, as we also noted, our outlook now reflects a more favorable fiscal year tax rate. I'll address the details behind our full year outlook and provide additional context on the Nutranext acquisition in a moment. First, I'll take you through our financial results for the third quarter. Third quarter sales grew 3% consistent with volume growth of 3% and about 1 point of pricing benefit, which was offset by about a point of negative mix. As a reminder, third quarter sales included a reduction of nearly 1 point from the Aplicare divestiture in August 2017. Gross margin was down as expected and came in at 42.8%, a decrease of 120 basis points versus year ago. This included about 160 basis points of higher commodity costs, as well as 130 basis points of higher logistics costs, which were driven, in large part, by ongoing challenges in the transportation market. Both commodities and logistics reflected the hurricane-related pressures we've previously discussed. Third quarter gross margin also included the benefit of about 140 basis points of cost savings, continuing our longstanding program of driving out waste. Selling and admin expenses as a percentage of sales were relatively flat at 13.7%. Advertising and sales promotion spending came in at about 10% of sales with spending behind our U.S. retail business at about 11% to continue supporting the long-term health of our brands. Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.37, which included $0.09 of benefit from a lower tax rate of 26% versus 30% in the year-ago quarter. Turning to cash flow. As we mentioned in our press release, year-to-date net cash provided by continuing operations increased to $574 million versus $483 million in the year-ago period. Now, I'll go over our fiscal year 2018 outlook. We now expect fiscal year sales to grow about 3% versus our previous assumption of 1% to 3% growth, driven by our expectation for 1 point of benefit from the Nutranext acquisition. Our full year sales outlook continues to include about 3 points of incremental sales from product innovation, partially offset by a reduction of nearly 1 point for the sale of the Aplicare business in August 2017. We now expect gross margin for the full year to be down 100 to 150 basis points, reflecting the impact from one-time charges related to the Nutranext acquisition, including typical integration costs such as inventory step-up. Our fiscal year gross margin expectations continue to include ongoing cost pressures related to commodities and logistics which we previously communicated. Additionally, we now expect fourth quarter gross margin to be down by 150 to 250 basis points, reflecting the one-time charges related to the Nutranext acquisition. Turning to selling and admin expenses for the fiscal year, we continue to anticipate selling and admin expenses to come in below 14% of sales. Our outlook also continues to include the benefits of tax reform with an updated assumption of 22% to 23% versus our previous assumption of 23% to 24% for our fiscal year tax rate. Longer term, we continue to anticipate our tax rate to be in the mid-20s range. Based on our updated fiscal year tax rate, we expect free cash flow for the fiscal year to come in at the higher end of our long-term goal of 11% to 13% of sales. As we discussed in our press release, fiscal year diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $6.15 to $6.30 versus $6.17 to $6.37. This update reflects our estimated $0.07 to $0.11 of EPS dilution from the Nutranext acquisition, partially offset by a slightly more favorable tax rate. As we also mentioned, we strongly believe the Nutranext acquisition brings significant breadth to our dietary supplements offerings building on the May 2016 RenewLife acquisition and expanding our portfolio further into health and wellness. Ongoing, we anticipate Nutranext to represent more than 3% of company sales. As previously communicated, on a U.S. GAAP basis, we continue to anticipate Nutranext to dilute earnings per share by $0.08 to $0.12 in fiscal year 2019, primarily driven by typical acquisition-related costs. Importantly, we continue to anticipate Nutranext to be accretive to earnings per share in fiscal year 2020. I'll close by sharing my perspective on the business. First, improving our margins remains a top priority. We're aggressively working to address the significant near-term headwinds from commodity and transportation costs by leaning into our productivity initiatives to drive cost savings and leveraging the pricing power of our brands where justified. Next, I remain confident in our 2020 strategy and we'll continue investing behind it to keep our value proposition sharp. Importantly, I believe strongly in the capabilities of our team to execute our strategy. And finally, we'll continue to put tax reform benefits to work with our ongoing focus to support long-term business growth and return excess cash to shareholders. In addition to our 14% dividend increase in February, we'll work with our board of directors to identify appropriate actions, including potential share repurchases, in addition to our usual program of repurchasing shares to offset dilution. As always, we'll continue to be disciplined in our allocation of capital and maintain our debt leverage with our target ratio of 2 to 2.5 times debt to EBITDA. And, with that, I'll turn it over to Benno. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Thank you, Kevin, and hello, everyone. Let me share with you my three key messages for today's call. First, we had a solid third quarter, delivering top line growth in line with targets and introducing several meaningful innovations to market. We're pleased, we grew third quarter volume and sales 3% on top of strong growth in the year-ago quarter with all segments reporting sales gains in the quarter. I feel good about these results, particularly given the impacts from the Aplicare sale and from our Charcoal business due to weather, which have continued into Q4. With the Nutranext acquisition which closed on April 2, we've updated our sales growth outlook for the fiscal year to about 3%, in an environment where growth continues to be hard to come by. A key factor in our achieving this is our continued ability to deliver strong innovation in innovation starved environment. In Q3, we launched or expanded several innovations, including the second wave of our successful Clorox Scentiva platform, which now offers bathroom and toilet cleaning products and a new scent; Fresh Step Clean Paws low track cat litter which while still early is thus far exceeding expectations; Glad ForceFlex Plus Advanced Protection trash bags with leak guard, our best Glad bag ever; and Burt's Bees cosmetics, which launched in Q2 and continued to expand distribution and grow velocities in Q3. Second, we remain committed to keeping our business fundamentally strong and healthy by taking aggressive, decisive and principled actions to address the headwinds that are affecting Clorox and our industry. Let me highlight three of the actions we're taking. First, we are taking pricing. We're pleased that the increase we took last November on Clorox disinfecting wipes is going well and we delivered double-digit Q3 volume and market share growth even in the face of it. We also took pricing in our Professional Products business consistently throughout the year, including the most recent one in Q3 and we've now taken pricing on about one-third of this business fiscal year-to-date. In addition, in April, we announced a price increase across nearly our entire Cat Litter business and we now are finalizing plans to take additional pricing more broadly across a significant portion of our company portfolio. Importantly, we believe we are in a solid position to take pricing. Why? Because we have a unique portfolio of market-leading brands, because we support these brands with strong marketing investments and innovation and the majority of our brands are seen by consumers as providing better value. Because of this, price sensitivities on our brands are even better today than they were three years ago, especially compared with the industry norm. And as I believe we made clear because these price increases are cost justified. But we won't stop there. We'll also lean into the more profitable parts in our portfolio. As always, we seek to grow our portfolio with margin-accretive innovation, such as with the Q3 new product introductions I just mentioned and also with exciting new items like Burt's Bees liquid lipsticks that started shipping on Monday of this week. And we'll continue our plans to build a more profitable mix in International by selectively investing in our International growth businesses, including portions of Laundry and Home Care as well as Burt's Bees and RenewLife, which in aggregate now account for a quarter of the International portfolio. And the final action I'll highlight is leaning even further into our strong cost savings programs and other margin improvement initiatives, such as with continued transformation of our supply chain, including with our new Atlanta West facility, which expanded our self-manufactured Home Care capacity and our Go Lean cost reduction and productivity improvement strategy for International, which is starting to produce year-on-year profit improvements on this business consistently. My third key message is that we remain confident in our 2020 Strategy and our ability to grow margins over time. We remain focused on good growth; growth that is profitable, sustainable and responsible. And in doing so, we'll focus on the right balance between taking aggressive action to address these near-term headwinds without losing sight of what has worked well for us over the long term; investing in a superior value of our brands behind innovation and technology transformation; evolving our portfolio as we have with Nutranext, which expands our business even further into the health and wellness space; and counting on our highly engaged workforce to execute with excellence and consistent with our core values. As Kevin said, we're pleased to put tax reform to work for our shareholders, while continuing to invest to support our brands and grow our business by investing in our infrastructure and by investing in our people, such as with the new global training program focused on enhancing our culture of inclusion and diversity. So, in summary, we remain focused on a balanced approach of investing for long-term profitable growth, while aggressively and decisively taking action to address near-term headwinds. We continue to have confidence in the competitiveness of our 2020 Strategy as we aim to create shareholder value over the long term. And, with that, I'll open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Dorer. We will take our first question from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Please go ahead. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citi Investment Research : Hi. Good afternoon. Could you talk a little bit about the private-label trends you're seeing in some of your bigger categories? Some of your other competitors in the HPC group have talked about more headwinds and I'm curious because you've historically had more exposure there what you're seeing specifically. And then second thing, can you just address the share repurchase program? I know the comments you just made said that you're willing and open to buy back more shares, but I'm kind of surprised we haven't seen you step up the pace of the repurchase activity yet. Thank you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Thank you, Wendy. I'll let Kevin comment on share repurchases and I'll briefly address your private-label question. As everybody recalls, we compete with private label largely in three out of our nine main categories. Our shares are stable. Our business is healthy in these categories. We're not seeing anything that would cause an increased level of concern as it relates to private label relative to what we've commented on in the last few quarters. We're always mindful of private label, which is why we're investing in our business, which is why we're keeping the value sharp, which is why we have innovation in those categories that we're competing with private label in, and which is why our businesses are generally doing well. So, private label is something that we're always mindful of, but there's no change to a stable status quo. And, with that, Kevin maybe you can comment on share repurchases. Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Sure. Hi, Wendy. In regard to the share repurchase programs, just as a reminder, we have two authorized programs with our board. One is called our evergreen program, which we use to manage stock option dilution and we've consistently been in the market over the last several years repurchasing shares. The other program is our open-market program, which we're authorized up to $750 million and we have not leveraged that program to date. What I would tell you is we have a very disciplined allocation of how we apply our cash and we'll continue to pursue that. And so, for us as we think about our priorities, first and foremost we're using our cash to invest back into our business, including targeted M&A and that's very consistent with our recent Nutranext acquisition. Secondarily, we're going to continue to focus on our dividend. We know that's important to our investor base and we'll continue to look at our dividend payout ratio. And consistent with that priority, as you folks saw, we just recently accelerated our dividend increase from May to February and took an outsized increase of 14%. Our third priority is, we'll continue to manage our debt. Currently, following the Nutranext acquisition, we're sitting nicely within our range of 2 to 2.5 times debt to EBITDA. And then finally, as we've always said, if we have cash pooling up on the balance sheet and we do not have good uses for it, we'll certainly look for ways to return that to shareholders and certainly open-market share repurchases would be the primary way to do that. And so, I would tell you going forward, as you know, Wendy, Clorox generates a significant amount of cash flow, tax reform has certainly increased the cash flow we generate as a company, and we'll continue to pursue these priorities going forward. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citi Investment Research : Okay. Got it. That's very helpful. But can you just clarify specifically on the Charcoal business, Benno, just vis-\u00e0-vis private label, it sounds like they're just weather headwinds and all those sorts of things. But in terms of your share, all of the incremental promotion you're going to be doing at retailers to stimulate some demand there. Is your share in the way you measure it still competitive and no issues there with private label gaining share in Charcoal? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. No concerns on Charcoal and private label. There's always some variation in share, particularly in the short term and in the periods that is less heavily promoted. What matters to us more is what shares look like in the late spring and the summer. The big news for us on Kingsford this quarter is that the weather, obviously, in Q3 has been very bad for this business and we can influence a lot of things, but weather we cannot. And Q4 certainly in April hasn't started much better. So, weather and the overall category declined as a result of it is the topic, which has led to a material impact in Q3 and we expect the softness perhaps also to impact Q4. But in terms of overall share, we feel good about this business. We're working with retailers on catch-up merchandising events to make up for some of the lost sales due to the weather earlier this year. We've just launched several innovations, new flavors and natural lighter fluid. We've kicked off partnership with Major League Baseball which we're very excited about, which includes customized baseball packaging. And we have new advertising in the category where we continue to have 100% share of voice. So, fundamentally this is a good business. It's delivered a lot of value to the company and to shareholders for many years. The basic underlying dynamics as millennials love barbecuing and they love barbecuing with Charcoal because of taste and the experience that Charcoal gives are very favorable. We're dealing with the short-term weather issue, which frankly makes for an easier comp next year, but that's about it. Business is stable and good and we're feeling optimistic about it once we've been through this weather issue. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citi Investment Research : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, thank you for the opportunity. I just want to zoom in more into the pricing commentary. Obviously, we all appreciate a more rational environment for pricing, but I wanted to kind of, if you can \u2013 obviously, when you had the Analyst Day in New York a couple of quarters back you were saying, which is a fair comment that it is tough now to take listing pricing increases. And obviously we never knew commodities would stay elevated as they are right now and then on top of that transportation. So, on your conversations with retailers, like how are you intending and is it embedded in your guidance for the revised guidance for margins? Is it embedded that you're taking these list price increases? And how much of that is already negotiated into the trade? Thank you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, Andrea. So, we can't comment on specific retailer conversations as always. What we have said is that obviously we have taken some price increases already. We have newly announced a few minutes ago that we have started to announce a price increase on Cat Litter. And as I also commented, we will finalize plans shortly to take additional pricing. Now, you will appreciate that there is lead time and that this will not affect this fiscal year anymore and we'll comment on how it will affect next fiscal year when we give our guidance in August. But there's always a 60 to 90 days lead time on when price increases become effective. And like I said, we're finalizing plans right now. You took us back to the Analyst Day in October. I would certainly say that what we've commented then on is that we're always looking at pricing when justified. The cost environment has changed very significantly versus last October. And now we're putting the pricing power that we have on our brands to action. We have leading brands. More than 80% of our brands are number one or strong number two. We believe our advantaged portfolio gives us confidence. Market leaders generally tend to lead pricing and we have many of those market leaders. We remain committed to offering brands that give consumers superior value, but we've always said that the majority of our brands does just that, which is why we're expanding household penetration of the majority of our brands. We're investing in our brands. Our price elasticities have been lower. We have innovation on all of our brands. So, we feel like the fundamental health of our business, the dynamics of our brands as well as the experience and the track record that we have, having executed many price increases over the last decade successfully, take hold here, in particular in an environment as we're seeing it today where these price increases are principled. They're cost justified and they generally do work for our categories. So, pricing is never easy to execute, but we have experience and are justified. And what we've certainly seen of the recent price increases on disinfecting wipes and on our professionals business and in International. We know how to take pricing and we're just putting that back to work. What I will say and I've hinted at that is that we're staying committed to value. So, I don't expect these price increases to negatively impact the superior value perceptions that our brands have among consumers because that's the lifeblood of our business and that's how we've been successful over the last few years. So, we're taking all of these price increases that we're announcing today and that we will continue to announce in the next quarter with an eye on staying committed to value for consumers. So, not easy, but the right thing to do and we have a solid case here which is why we're putting it to work. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And just to follow up, Benno, there is no effect now as you had with the wipes, with the trash bags, right? So, net-net you're still going up and you're not seeing opportunities on the value segment at this point, right? The movement is actually up, a net up. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. I mean you've seen disinfecting wipes had another great quarter. That's a business that's been running from strength to strength. It's been growing double digits and that's because we're not just taking pricing. We have a lot of innovation in the market and we're investing in marketing campaigns that resonate with consumers. So, wipes has done exceptionally well in the face of pricing, but we're also seeing the Glad trash bags as a result of the pricing action that we took, which as you'll recall was a price decline end of last year on about 40% of volume. The business has responded very well. Total Glad business grew volume and sales in Q3. The trash business grew volume high-single digits in Q3. The most strategic business in trash bags, which is our OdorShield business grew double digits. And Glad trash has now returned to share growth in tracked channels which is something that we're pleased to notice. So, those two pricing actions have gone exactly in line with plans, which is again consistent with a message that we've conveyed to you over many years, which is that we are able to model based on strong analytics what are price increases and in the Glad case, the price decreases due to our business very well and very reliably. And we'll certainly update you and the rest of the community on specifics and how it will impact our fiscal year 2019 in August. But what we've commented on is that we're optimistic that in the midterm we're able to grow profitably, meaning growing sales and margins. And we continue to be optimistic about that very thing. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you very much. This is helpful. Operator : Our next question will come from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. I wanted to circle back to private label in your categories, Benno. I was hoping you could give us a sense as to how private-label competitors have been responding to your price increases and the pressures they're also facing from higher commodities and manufacturing costs. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, Bonnie. Again, the only price increase that's been out for a while now is on Clorox disinfecting wipes where we have not seen much pricing from private label where we also didn't count on any pricing from private label. But I think the results on sales, again double-digit growth last quarter speak for themselves. So, I can't comment yet on how private label will respond to other price increases because we haven't announced any other price increases other than Litter just yet, but that's not been effective in the marketplace. So, I can give you certainly a more detailed outlook and report back when we talk again next quarter. But generally, what we do is we make very specific assumptions based on market dynamics. We don't always count on private label to respond. Clearly, to your point that you made in your question, the increases that we see are cost increases that retailers see too, that private-label manufacturers see too. Everybody in our industry is affected by them and historically what we've seen is that many times when we took pricing, private label have followed. In some cases, they haven't. But that doesn't negatively impact the materiality of the positive impact that pricing has on our business and the general success of our price increases. So, more to come on Q4. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And if I may just also ask a little bit of a follow-on question on the pricing, I know we're talking a lot about it, but I think it's important. But I'd like to hear more on elasticity or the impact on your volumes, what you might be seeing from what you've put into the marketplace already. And has that elasticity changed in the last year? And then in terms of volume, is it fair to assume that your volumes should accelerate in Q4 given you've really lapped the tough comps now? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. I can't comment on Q4. We don't typically do that. When I think about the rest of your question as it relates to elasticities, again, I can speak to Clorox disinfecting wipes. No change to elasticities, post the price increase. Even though it's early, it takes a while until we have reliable data on that, but again double-digits gains. So, you can see that that business continues to do well because we match up price increases with innovations and with the right investments and we certainly have every intention to continue to do that, too. I commented on a new price increase on Cat Litter, which comes on the back of a double-digit growth quarter on that business because we are investing behind Clean Paws, which is off to a really fantastic start. So, we know how to take pricing and what we would expect is that price elasticities aren't fundamentally harmed. What we have commented on last quarter, which I want to re-emphasize, is that our price elasticities over the last three years actually have gone down. And you all know that lower price sensitivity is just better and they've gone down significantly, whereas for the rest of the industry the price elasticities have gone up. So, we are perhaps somewhat of a unique case in this industry. I know that other companies have perhaps commented that the pricing environment is more challenging. But again, I would point to the strength of our portfolio, but the strength of our investments, the strength of our innovation program, and the facts and the data behind growing household penetration, having brands that offer superior value, lower price elasticities that all make a very solid case that we have pricing power on Clorox brands. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : We'll move next to Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Hello, everyone. Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Hey, Kevin. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Kevin, question for you on cost savings. Clorox Company has done a tremendous job on this front over a long period of time. But clearly in this environment with higher input costs and pricing difficulty come by, it's even more important. Two questions for you on this front. What are the biggest areas of focus? And then number two, how do you think about the opportunity relative to the 150 basis points per year that you've delivered now over the past several years? How should we think about that contribution now going forward? Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Kevin. What I'd say overall on cost savings is, your first question was where's our focus, our focus consistently has been looking at every area where we spend money and the way I describe Clorox very simplistically is $6 billion in sales. We spend about $5 billion on all aspects of the company and we generate about $1 billion in profit. We are focused on attacking the entire $5 billion spend. So, I have no one area that I focus on. But we have a program that looks at that entire spend. And every year we're trying to deliver 2% productivity across that spend. And as you mentioned, Kevin, we have a very strong track record of doing that. And I have strong confidence that going forward we'll continue to be able to deliver that type of savings. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : And, Kevin, can you help us just frame the potential magnitude in that front just from a modeling perspective? I mean, as we look at the headwind from freight and commodity costs, pricing will hopefully come through and stick. But can you help us at all frame the potential favorability from upside above and beyond what you've historically delivered given that it's sort of takes on greater urgency? Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, I would say, Kevin, you guys should be considering that we'll continue to pursue 150 basis points of EBIT margin expansion through cost savings. We've done that historically very consistently and going forward, again I feel very confident we'll continue to be able to do that. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Can you hear me? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Sorry. Benno, I guess a big-picture question for me. The sector is broadly under a lot of duress and there are a lot of factors at play, but it really seems to me that we're seeing just a shift in the historic balance of power within the CPG value chain away from incumbent big branded CPG companies and towards new niche players, towards retail inclusive of Amazon and private-label brands, and ultimately towards the consumer resulting in this perceived lack of CPG pricing power and perceived risks for long-term market share and margins. So, I guess the question is, what's your perspective on that? Do you agree that such a shift is happening? And if so, why is Clorox in a more sustainable position than others? You're clearly outperforming on the top line, but can you afford to maintain both market share and margins over the longer term against what \u2013 I think it feels to many like a structurally more difficult backdrop going forward? Thanks. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Thanks, Steve. Certainly not an easy environments for all the reasons that you said. We remain confident that we will be able to grow and grow profitably, meaning sales and margin going forward. And we have a lot of things that perhaps aren't very common these days. We have increased our brand investments over time. We are leading our industry when it comes to engaging consumers online. We have innovation in an environment where little innovation exists. And we have built a relatively wide moat around our businesses through innovation, through technology, through manufacturing capabilities. So, we do feel like our business fundamentally is healthy and I think our top line results show that. We're dealing with heavy headwinds, which hopefully will be temporary and which everybody sees, and that's what we're addressing. But we do feel like we're in a relatively unique position because our brands are strong. And if I look at our fundamentals, they're really healthy. You mentioned customers. Last quarter we grew volume with 15 out of our 20 top U.S. customers, which includes the very largest customers. So, while philosophically I can appreciate how retailers are in a position of power, how retailers certainly like the profitability of private labels. At the end of the day, consumers are the ones who decide whether companies are successful or not. And we are serving consumers extremely well and better than we ever have, I might add, which is why fundamentally our business is healthy. We have a short-term margin issue. We're addressing that margin issue aggressively mostly through pricing. And that's why we remain confident in our ability to not just grow profitably, but also on the back of a really strong balance sheet continue to add a lot of value to shareholders. So, it's a dynamic environment. But this environment will have winners and losers. But we at Clorox look at this as a time to lead and as an opportunity. And today we're winners and we have every right to be confident that it will continue to be like that. Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you very much. I'll leave it there. Welcome to the call, Kevin. Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks. My first question is around gross margin. First, for the quarter, that 70 basis point benefit from other, is that primarily revenue mix? And then on the outlook, how much would the outlook have changed on gross margin, excluding Nutranext or said another way, is the $0.07 to $0.11 dilution for the deal, is that all coming in COGS because that's a really wide range on the gross margin given we have only one quarter left in the year? Thanks. Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Thanks, Olivia, for the question. On the 70 basis points, I'd say that's a combination of revenue mix as you described. It includes our divestiture of the Aplicare business which certainly improved margins. And then on your other question as it relates to margin, the change in our outlook is solely driven by the addition of Nutranext to our outlook. And so, as we said previously in February, we'd be down modestly and we described that as less than 1 point. That's still my expectation for the base business as we look forward. But we are now adding in Nutranext to the business. And if you're familiar with the acquisition accounting, we will now have to revalue all the inventory we've acquired to fair market value, which means as we sell through that inventory we'll generate very little margin or profit on that business. And so, I expect that to play out certainly for the fourth quarter and then likely early into fiscal year 2019 as well before we sell through all the acquired inventory. And maybe last comment in regard to the range, what I'd say there is this is obviously new business. We've owned it less than 30 days. And so, we're still working through trying to understand the implications of that business. I think this was an appropriate outlook for the new acquisition. But we'll see how that plays out in the next few months. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Understood. And then just broadly, would love to understand the rationale for the Nutranext deal. You guys have obviously been very clear in your interest in expanding in areas like wellness. It's obviously growth accretive, but it's a very fragmented category with no clear leader. So, I'm wondering, what do you guys think that you guys have that will either, A, give you a platform to consolidate share; B, be able to launch some of \u2013 or potentially bring in some of your existing products into new channels or vice versa bringing that business into channels where you have greater relationships. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Thanks, Olivia. As you know, we like fragmented categories with no clear leader. We feel like this meets all the criteria of a solid acquisition that we've frankly been emphasizing for years. It's bolt-on in nature. It's U.S. centric. It's in the health and wellness space which, of course, we know well and have expanded into more specifically as it relates to vitamins, minerals and supplements well with RenewLife. It's a really solid fit with our capabilities and it's profitable and growing. So, those are the criteria that we talked about for many years and this one checks off all the boxes. So, we're excited about the prospects. This is a fast-growing business, a profitable business, gives us scale and breadth in vitamins, minerals and supplements. And importantly, we have several number one brands in differentiated niches, and we love that. We've built our company on the back of precisely such brands. And what Nutranext does is bring really strong capabilities, for instance, in direct to consumers to Clorox. About a third of this business is in direct to consumer and we love that. But this business will benefit from our capabilities, for instance, in marketing, R&D, sales and product supply. So, near term, right now what we're focused on is bringing the two companies and organizations together and are off to a really nice start. And then, we'll go ahead and expand distribution and brick and mortar and e-commerce. We'll plug in our marketing capability. We love that we're in differentiated segments here, emerging segments, not single letter vitamins, but product benefits that are scientifically grounded and that start to have a really strong following among consumers. We'll create a strong innovation program. We'll choicefully take these brands international and see a lot of opportunities there. And importantly, we'll realize cost synergies as we plug in our operational machines. So, this has all the components of an acquisition that we like. For anyone who's listened to what kind of acquisition we like, this meets all criteria and we're very optimistic about this. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Right. Thanks, Benno. Thanks, Kevin. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Wanted to tackle a few more things. One is back on pricing, totally get the commentary that you've made, but very simply, are you taking pricing in line with inflation? Because it looks domestically always your pricing might have been down, including trade spend and everything else. So, want to pressure test a little bit that topic. And then, the second one is around reinvestment. Clearly, marketing spend look like it was down a couple of hundred \u2013 or 100 basis points this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the plan there? Why that was a good idea for the quarter, and the plan there going forward? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Ali, I'll take reinvestments, and then I'll let Kevin answer your question on pricing. So, as you think about advertising spending, so we have committed and said that about 10% of sales is the right level. We've also said that there's going to be variability by quarter based on timing of initiatives. Q3 was 9.8% of sales. So, that's exactly in line with about 10% long-term guidance. And at the end of the day, look, the proof is in the pudding. We grew 3% in volume and sales on top of 7% volume and 4% year ago despite the headwind in Charcoal and despite a 1-point hit on Aplicare. So, to me this is a non-issue. We remain committed to the 10% and we have no interest in cutting, in particular, because we have and we'll continue to have a very strong innovation program. Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, Ali. And in regard to pricing, as you look at our pricing, we anticipate about 1 point of benefit to both the quarter and the year. Historically, that's been primarily driven by our International segment. I'd say though this year's a bit different with some of the pricing actions that Benno previously talked about. A portion of that is being driven by the U.S. And then as it relates to trade spending, we've actually pulled back a bit on trade spending and so we've taken pricing in the U.S. and reduced our trade spending. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And so just a follow-up on that and a different question on M&A, just a follow-up on pricing. I guess, I stay with the question, are you able to take pricing in line with cost inflation? Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: So, Ali, the way we think about it is, we certainly price what we describe as the long-term inflation rate. So, we won't look at a change in any one quarter, but we price to the long-term view we have of commodities, and so that's certainly the approach we take and we've taken historically. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And then the separate question is just in terms of M&A and I want to pause on that for a moment and try to understand the track record and where you think your skill set is in terms of M&A. You can go back to things like Aplicare, you can go back to \u2013 which you're divesting now clearly. Burt's Bees took a little while obviously to ramp up. RenewLife sounds like a short-term hiccup, would love more color there, but there is a hiccup going on there now. Can you talk a little bit just about your core competencies that you may have developed over the past little while in terms of acquisition capabilities or any places you think you can improve? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: I mean, we feel good about our ability to do M&A. We started as a bleach company and we built our company based on M&A over 105 years. So, I feel good about that. I would clearly call Burt's Bees a successful acquisition for our company. We've divested Aplicare, but you can't win them all. RenewLife has been a real success with a one-time hiccup that will return to normal and back on track in Q4. And now we're going into Nutranext and feel like this is a great fit with our company. So, feel good about our ability to do M&A, feel good about the ability to create value, and feel like we have a solid track record. I don't think any company has a track record of 100%. If that company exists, I would like to know which it is. But I look forward and feel very confident about Nutranext. We've invested a lot in M&A capability and our approach over the last three years, it's nothing I want to comment on publicly, but feel very confident about our capabilities in the area and very bullish about Nutranext. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Next question will come from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please go ahead. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Good afternoon. Thank you. Or it's good morning your time, sorry. A couple things, first of all, ACV on Burt's Bees cosmetics that were launched in Q2 both where we are today and versus target? And how would we or even you looking back a year from now, what would be a success for the size and rollout of that business? And then just secondly, how big did an outsized flu season play? Is there any way of quantifying that within Cleaning? I know it was huge in the scanner data. I want to know how that lines up with shipments maybe some of the unmeasured volumes. Thank you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Thanks, Jonathan. I'll take cold and flu first while it's fresh. Clearly, this was a relatively strong cold and flu season, but actually it wasn't as strong as it was presented in some of the commentary that I've read. Cold and flu incidents was up 6% to 8% versus a year ago. The cold and flu season was below the levels of, for sure of fiscal year 2013 and 2015. So, it was higher, but not severe. And as a result, we've seen some impact perhaps on our wipes business, but not material and that's because that particular business as is our business, in general, is less and less dependent on cold and flu because what really drives consumption is the planning that we do with our customers year-on-year to merchandise this business very aggressively during the winter season. And we have very strong merchandising plans and consumption, regardless of the season, which is why I wouldn't look at cold and flu as a material driver behind our Q3 results in that segment. On Burt's Bees, perhaps more broadly and to put it in perspective, strong quarter again with volume and sales growth in the high-single digits. Feel good about lip care and the consumption. A little tidbit, it's early and before we get overly excited, but the last four weeks was the first time that our lip balm actually reached the number one market share position in tracked channels ever. So, that tells you that we're very focused on continuing to keep the core business very healthy and it is. But also our innovation in face care and in cosmetics continues to do well and has contributed. We don't typically comment on ACV levels on innovations, but it's still building. And that's driven by retailer shelf resets and marketing timing. And I would say that on cosmetics Q2 was the start. Q3 was a significant ramp-up in distribution, but we're not done yet and we're also not done yet in investing in the proposition. Cosmetics continues to expand velocities and we're pleased with where we are. And we have just this week launched a new line of liquid lipsticks which continues the strong stream of meaningful innovations getting into a more cosmetics and lip color type of field. Liquid lipsticks for perspective, those of you who have less experience or like me with \u2013 as consumers with the category, it's a form of lipstick, but has the finish of a lip-gloss. So, it's somewhere in between two categories and it's very on trend. It's a growing category and we launched this as part of the strategic effort to give consumers beautiful and on trend products that are 100% natural. So, we'll continue to have a very solid stream on Burt's Bees, both on the base as well as in our cosmetics. Not in a position to give specific sales targets for our initiatives. We generally don't do that. But as you can see from our efforts over the last year, we view cosmetics as a very interesting, strategic field for the brand to play based on what consumers tell us. And we have a number of initiatives that we feel good about already in the markets that will continue and we're pretty optimistic not just about optimistic, but Burt's Bees as a whole. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Shannon Coyne with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Shannon Coyne - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just really quickly back on the pricing, I'm just wondering if you guys \u2013 are you seeing the same or different dynamic in pricing online versus brick and mortar. Also, I'm wondering if there are regional differences. So, are you finding it harder, or are retailers pushing back and raising prices in the Southeast, for example, where all the (01:00:48) are opening up a large number of stores there? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. So, for us we have one \u2013 we have a pricing policy that we call fair and equitable, so there's no difference between online and brick and mortar. And as far as regional differences are concerned, again, can't comment on specific discussions that we have with retailers, national or regional. And again, keep in mind that there's just one new price increase out there. And what we've commented is that we will finalize plans to certainly take additional price increases over the next few months. Those will take time. In many cases, the discussions, of course, because we haven't finalized plans yet, have not taken place. So, it's a little bit premature, yeah. But what I will say is that again taking pricing is never easy. Taking pricing always has bumps in the road near term. Taking pricing always as consumers adjust to new higher price levels leads to somewhat lower volumes temporarily for about 12 months or so until consumers have gotten used to the new price points. But we have a strong track record of taking pricing. And we know how to execute it successfully and I expect that track record to continue. Shannon Coyne - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Sorry, I was on mute. Wanted to just ask about inventory de-stocking. I mean obviously nothing apparent in your results this quarter in terms of volume growth, but I was curious what you are seeing in terms of inventory levels at retail of any of the de-stocking that you'd mentioned last quarter and then I think some other peer companies have still discussed, it's something you're still seeing or not really? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Thanks, Lauren. As you mentioned, we had inventory adjustments late in Q2 in a few of our categories and we commented on that in our last quarterly call. We also then commented on the fact that we're off to a really strong start in January leading us to believe that some of it came back. We also commented that we didn't see a material impact on the year then. And there's really no news to that. So, certainly in Q3 we don't feel like there was a significant impact from inventories. We also continue to believe that this is not going to impact the fiscal year in any material way. We also think that it always evens out in the long run. So, we don't think that we're sitting on high inventories that are at risk going forward. So, inventories this last quarter was a non-factor. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. And then just one follow-up I still had on Nutranext. So, my understanding anyway of the probiotics is, there's a lot of medical research, all of it. There's a lot of work going on in the probiotics space, in my sense, is it probably maybe a bit of a difference in terms of the clinical studies and things that have gone on in that space versus some of the areas where Nutranext plays? So, if you could just talk a little bit about, I guess, the credentials, the medical backing and so on of this new business that you're acquiring is one. And then, two, just a bigger question on cyclicality in the VMS category, I feel like it's a business where it was on trend for several years and then there's some journal article that tells people it doesn't work or whatever it is and then there's a falloff and then it comes back. So, is there any concern that you're introducing a level of cyclicality to your business that really doesn't exist otherwise? Thanks. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Thanks, Lauren. So, before we become interested in the category, we start with the attractiveness of the category itself and that includes, in this case, the scientific backing. It also includes the sustainability of a category. And we feel like we've done our homework on this. If I mention two of the major brands that we bought, one is around anti-stress and sleep and that has a lot to do with magnesium levels. If you Google that and if you do a research, there's a lot of scientific research out there. One of their brands, NeoCell is a leader in collagens. Again, a lot of research out there. And if you think about perhaps the third bigger brand, which is in food-based vitamins, that is a trend within multivitamins that people like, they're less synthetic, more food-based multivitamins that also contain super foods and other nutrients. And that, of course, is a more general trend not just in vitamins, minerals and supplements. So, we do think that these are based on solid science. We have a good advisory council of scientists that we use to assess the attractiveness and the scientific soundness of the categories that we're in. And we've always commented as a company, we build brands for decades and not just for the short term. And we feel like the businesses that we bought and the categories that we will now be in certainly fall into that category line. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much. Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.: We'll take one more question. Operator : Our last question will come from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thank you for squeezing me in. I appreciate that. I wanted to come back to the pricing question real quick and I apologize if you already gave this, Benno. But can you give us some color in terms of how the Cat Litter price increase has been received so far? And the broader price moves that you're planning right now was the decision to move forward those at all educated with some preliminary conversations with retailers. And if so, how did those preliminary conversations go? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Jason, appreciate the question. Cannot comment on specific conversations that we have with retailers. As you will appreciate, the Litter conversation is still pretty new. As I've commented, we began to announce this last month. So, by no means are we through those conversations. And then as we think about what we do to consider pricing, we always look at the competitive set. We look at the retailer dynamics. We look at the strength of our business. We look at price sensitivities. So, there's multiple factors that go into the decision on taking pricing. But I would perhaps just point back at my comments from earlier that we know how to take pricing because we've taken pricing many times before, including this fiscal year, and we always get through it. We live in categories where consumers do not buy more if pricing is lower. So, we understand and over the years it's been proven that taking pricing when justified as is the case here, it's a key driver to add value to categories for retailers, too. Most of our categories as you think about volume have grown modestly, but in terms of value have grown significantly over the years. And a big part of that is trade up through pricing and through innovation. That's how our categories work. That's what we've built our company on and that's why we're investing in innovation, in marketing and solid value. But that's also why we keep taking pricing when justified. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: No doubt. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: And today's environment is no different than the environment was, for instance, 10 years ago when the economy went south when it was really hard to take pricing, but we did. So, I look at this as a very solid case that's very well considered and that we'll execute with excellence. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you for that. And one follow-up just on productivity within the gross margin line, clearly looking at margin bridges you guys continue to deliver. But you're leaking all of it and then some out through logistics and manufacturing line there. I appreciate there's some logistical cost inflation system right now, but just looking back over the last five years in netting cost saves just first logistics manufacturings netted you to zero, if not a modest deficit. So, as we think about cost saves and that net logistics manufacturing line, so effectively a net cost save line, is there a glide path to getting that, the aggregate to flip positive? If so, what are the drivers? And what could the cadence look like? Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Jason, this is Kevin. What I would say is if you look over long periods of time and as we've said, we are committed to growing EBIT margins 25 to 50 basis points. If you look back over the last nine years, I think we've grown EBIT 35 basis points on average per year. That clearly won't be the case in any given quarter and given year. But over long periods of time, I feel very comfortable with our ability to keep growing margins. As we look forward, we're clearly in an inflationary cycle right now and then obviously you're hearing us talk quite a bit about pricing, because we need to price to recover the cost increases we're incurring. So, as I look forward, I have to set an expectation that we're still committed to growing margins. We feel confident that we can do that because we do have pricing power and we will execute that pricing power to offset the cost increases we're incurring. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would like to turn the program back over to you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Thank you and thank you, everyone. We look forward to speaking with you again in August when we share our fiscal year-end results and outlook for fiscal year 2019. So, have a good day, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Clorox Company Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. And I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Lisah, you may begin your conference. Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Company : Thank you, Vickie, and welcome, everyone. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, our Chairman and CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com. On today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA, and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliations with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available on our website as well as in our SEC filings. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release. Please also recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly, as it relates to the impact of tax legislation. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcome to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn to our top-line commentary. I'll discuss highlights in each of our segments. Kevin will then address our financial results as well as our outlook for FY 2019. Finally, Benno will offer his perspective and we will close with Q&A. For the total company, Q4 sales grew 3% and full year sales also grew 3% with growth in three of our four segments. I will now go through our results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q4 sales grew 3% and full year sales also grew 3% on top of strong 5% growth in prior fiscal year. Cleaning segment growth was driven by the continued strong momentum in our largest business unit, Home Care, which saw high single-digit sales growth in both Q4 and full year as well as share growth for the fourth consecutive year. Within Home Care, Clorox Disinfecting Wipes grew sales double-digits in Q4 following our price increase demonstrating the strength of our equity. Pass-through of our November 2017 price increase and competitive reactions are all generally in line with our expectations. Also contributing to Home Care's growth this quarter was the expansion of our successful Clorox Scentiva line into new bath aerosol and toilet cleaning products. The Scentiva innovation platform continues to be well received by consumers. In our Laundry business, sales were about flat for the quarter and the year. We continue to shift the mix of this business to the premium segment, and are pleased to see Clorox's liquid bleach grew share for the quarter and for the year. In May, we launched new powerful bleach advertising, which inspires consumers to use bleach by focusing on unique moments showcasing bleach as the solution. Lastly, within the Cleaning segment, our Professional Products sales declined for the quarter and for the year due to the Aplicare divestiture, which we will lap during this month of August. Excluding the impact of Aplicare, sales grew strongly for the quarter and for the year following price increases on about a third of the portfolio. Looking ahead to FY 2019, we are in the process of executing additional pricing actions across another significant portion of the portfolio. Before moving off discussion on this business, I want to mention that one of the areas we're especially pleased with and that's the strength and potential of the Total Clorox 360 System innovations which we introduced in late March 2017. This system uses an electrostatic technology, allowing disinfectants to reach even the hardest to reach areas in the facilities. Market response to Total 360 has been very positive with more than 25 professional sports team having adopted it for their athletic facilities as well as hundreds of schools and other commercial facilities. Turning to the Household segment, Q4 sales decreased 3% on top of 4% growth in the year ago quarter. On a full year basis, Household segment sales came in flat on top of strong 5% growth in FY 2017. Sales decline in Household was largely driven by Charcoal. Q4 sales were down, driven in part by cold weather earlier in the quarter as well as lower merchandising levels at several retailers. Full year sales also declined. For perspective, Q4 is our largest quarter in this business and in combination with Q3 makes up more than two-thirds of the year sales. Looking ahead, we're focused on continuing to extend the grilling season in partnership with Major League Baseball as well as partnering with retailers to optimize merchandising strategies to grow the category and attract new users along with expanding our premium tier of products. In our Cat Litter business, Q4 sales grew double-digits on top of double-digit year ago sales growth, driven by core strength and our new Clean Paws innovation. Clean Paws has been one of our biggest litter launch out of the gate, and continues to perform very well. The Cat Litter business continues to have strong momentum as reflected in seven consecutive quarters of market share growth as well as high-single-digit sales growth for the year. As you may remember, during our May earnings call, we announced the price increase on this business effective July 1. We're pleased to report that pass-through is on track and higher prices are already reflected at shelf at several major retailers including the largest retailer. In our Glad bags and wraps business, Q4 sales declined slightly, but were about flat for the year. This is mainly driven by lower sales of food bags and wraps as well as the strategic price pullback we implemented on a portion of our trash bags business earlier this fiscal year. Importantly, we continue to grow sales strongly in our premium trash segment behind a continued stream of innovation on our OdorShield scented trash bag platform, as well as capitalizing on new patented dual layer technology. Our new ForceFlex Plus Advanced Protection trash bags introduced earlier in the year are performing well in market. In FY 2019, we will complete our conversion to this new dual layer form of trash bags which is now part of our overall strategy to deliver patent protected consumer preferred products that use less resin. Finally, turning to RenewLife, sales decreased this quarter partly as we make changes to our supply chain to address the challenges we discussed with you last quarter. We're midway through this changes which we expect to complete this fall and customer service levels are currently tracking back at targeted levels. Q4 sales were also impacted by higher trade spending to support several trial building programs. Sales were about flat for the year, reflecting strong growth in the first half offset by declines in the back half of the fiscal year due to the challenges I just discussed. Looking ahead, we expect to return to sales growth as we continue to build distribution on our new organic line, expand distribution of our core products and further increase our e-commerce presence. In our Lifestyle segment, Q4 sales increased 21%, reflecting gains from the Nutranext acquisition. And on a full year basis, sales increased 8%, largely reflecting the benefit of Nutranext. Brita sales grew for the quarter, reflecting lower trade spending and strong e-commerce growth. Sales for the full year were up slightly, reflecting the continued success of our Stream Pitcher innovation and Brita Stream continues to be the number one selling pitcher on Amazon. Burt's Bees sales grew for the quarter and for the year. We're especially pleased at the health of our core Burt's Bees business with our lip balm assuming the number one market share position for the last quarter in the total lip balm category for the first time, contributing to a record quarter in shipments for lip care. In the meantime, our cosmetics launch continues to perform well in market and the liquid lipsticks are now shipping and available in select stores. This form of lipstick makes up about 20% of lipstick category today and it's growing at a very strong double-digits rate. Wrapping up the Lifestyle segment, food sales declined for the quarter but increased for the year. Q4 results reflect timing of merchandising at a large retailer. At the same time, we're pleased that our total Hidden Valley equity grew share for the 14th consecutive quarter. In particular, our dry dressing business grew behind our focus on extending use as a seasoning and recipe ingredient. Finally, turning to International, Q4 sales decreased 2% mainly reflecting unfavorable FX headwinds primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso which more than offsets the benefit of price increases. On a full year basis, International sales grew 2% despite FX headwinds of about two points. We continue to focus on our Go Lean strategy to drive margin improvement while selectively investing in margin accretive portions of our International portfolio that have tailwinds. We're pleased to see the areas we're investing in growing both in absolute and as a percent of our International business such as Burt's Bees, which reported double-digit growth again this quarter. Now, I'll turn it over to Kevin, who'll discuss our Q4 and fiscal year performance as well as outlook for FY 2019. Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Thank you, Lisah. We're pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal year results. We continue to make solid progress in a challenging environment, delivering strong sales and earnings growth, while continuing to generate healthy cash flow. Turning to our financial results for the fourth quarter, Q4 sales grew 3% driven by three points of benefit from Nutranext acquisition, partially offset by about one point of unfavorable foreign currency, largely driven by the recent devaluation of the Argentine peso and nearly one point of negative impact of the Aplicare sale. Fourth quarter sales also reflect volume growth supported by innovation as well as one point of pricing benefit which was offset by about one point of unfavorable mix. Gross margin for the quarter came in as expected at 44%, a decrease of 170 basis points compared to 46% in the year ago quarter. Fourth quarter gross margin included about 130 basis points of unfavorable commodities and about 100 basis points of logistics costs, partially offset by the benefits of 120 basis points of cost savings and 50 basis points of pricing. As previously communicated, fourth quarter gross margin also included about 60 basis points from charges related to the Nutranext acquisition. Selling, administrative expenses increased about 0.5 to 13.5% of sales, largely driven by cost related to the Nutranext acquisition, partially offset by lower employee incentive compensation costs and progress from our ongoing productivity initiatives. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels for the quarter came in at about 9% of sales. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate came in at 28.7% versus 31.7% in the year ago quarter, largely reflecting the benefits from U.S. tax reform. Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.66, an increase of 8%. Now, I'll turn to our results for the full fiscal year. Sales grew 3%, which included about three points of growth from innovation and about one point of benefit from the Nutranext acquisition, partially offset by about one point of negative impact from the Aplicare divestiture. Gross margin for the fiscal year came in as expected, down 100 basis points at 43.7% compared to 44.7% in fiscal year 2017. Fiscal year gross margin results included 130 basis points of higher commodity costs and 90 basis points of logistics pressure, partially offset by 140 basis points of cost savings and 40 basis points from pricing. We're proud of our strong track record of delivering annual cost savings of more than $100 million, which we achieved for the 11th consecutive year in fiscal year 2018. Selling, administrative expenses for the full fiscal year came in at about 13.7% of sales essentially flat versus year ago. Advertising and sales promotion as a percentage of sales for fiscal year 2018 came in at about 9% of sales with U.S. retail spending at slightly above 10% of sales. For the full fiscal year, our effective tax rate was 21.8% compared to the year ago rate of 31.9%, primarily reflecting the benefit of U.S. tax reform. Net of all these factors, our fiscal year diluted EPS from continuing operations was $6.26 compared with $5.35 in fiscal year 2017, an increase of 17%. Turning to cash flow for the fiscal year, net cash provided by continuing operations in fiscal year 2018 came in at $974 million versus $871 million in the prior year, an increase of 12%. At the end of fiscal year 2018, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.9 times, slightly below our target range of 2 times to 2.5 times. Now, I'll turn to our fiscal year 2019 outlook. We expect fiscal year sales to be in the range of 2% to 4%, reflecting about 3 points of growth from innovation, about 2.5 points of benefit from the net impact of the Nutranext acquisition and the Aplicare divestiture, and about 2 points of negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, primarily driven by the recent devaluation in Argentina. Turning to gross margin, we expect fiscal year gross margin to be about flat to up modestly, reflecting the benefits of pricing and a strong cost savings pipeline partially offset by the continuation of higher costs related to commodities and logistics. In the second quarter, we should start seeing the full benefits from our recently announced price increases and the comparison to the significant cost run-ups that started in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, leading to gross margin expansion in the back half of fiscal year 2019. We expect fiscal year advertising and sales promotion spending to come in at about 10% of sales. As we mentioned in the press release, selling and administrative expenses are expected to come in at about 14% of sales, reflecting acquisition related investments and more normalized levels of performance based incentive compensation. We expect fiscal year EBIT margin to be about flat, reflecting increased investments in our brands and Nutranext related costs. Our outlook also includes the ongoing benefits of U.S. tax reform with the assumption that our fiscal year tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%, slightly higher than our fiscal year 2018 rate as we lap a number of one-time benefits in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 as a result of U.S. tax reform. We expect free cash flow for fiscal year 2019 to come in at about 11% to 13% of sales, consistent with our recently updated long-term goal. Importantly, recognizing our strong track record of generating healthy cash flows and the strength of our balance sheet, we will continue to invest in the long-term health of our business and reward our shareholders. As a reminder, in fiscal year 2018, we acquired the Nutranext business, further expanding our portfolio into health and wellness. We also increased our quarterly dividend by 14%, marking the 42nd consecutive year we have increased our dividend and we initiated a share repurchase program of up to $2 billion. And we currently plan to repurchase about half the full amount in fiscal year 2019. Net of all these factors, fiscal year diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.32 to $6.52 which includes our previously communicated estimate of $0.08 to $0.12 of EPS dilution from the Nutranext acquisition. Fiscal year diluted EPS also includes about $0.05 to $0.07 of negative impact from the recently enacted tariffs which are affecting a couple of our business units. As we start our new fiscal year, I'd like to highlight a few areas we are aggressively managing. First, we remain focused on executing our recently announced price increases in support of our efforts to drive profitable growth. We have a strong track record of taking pricing which is supported by our emphasis on delivering superior consumer value behind strong investments in innovation. To date, our pricing actions are progressing in line with our expectations. Next, we continue to anticipate elevated cost pressures from commodities particularly resin as well as the transportation market. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect these headwinds to be more pronounced in the first half of the fiscal year and to lap these significant cost run-ups that began in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. That said, we're operating in a volatile cost environment, which could impact the timing of our gross margin progress. While it's early, we assume gross margin expansion in the back half of fiscal year 2019. And finally, we continue to face challenging economic conditions in International including the recent currency devaluation in Argentina. Consistent with our 2020 Strategy, we're addressing these challenges head-on with an eye on the long-term health of our business. We are increasing investments in our brands including innovation to support brand differentiation which will help us continue to deliver superior consumer value. We are leaning into our cost savings programs and productivity initiatives to address ongoing cost pressures. And finally continuing to execute our Go Lean strategy in International to partially mitigate the more challenging currency environment we're expecting. In closing, we're pleased with our solid results in fiscal year 2018. We will continue to drive our 2020 Strategy with an emphasis on creating superior consumer value which is enabling us to consistently deliver sales growth in an environment where growth is hard to come by. Importantly, we remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term shareholder value. And with that, I will turn it over to Benno. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Hi, everyone. And thanks, Kevin. I'll now offer my perspective. First, we delivered another solid year advancing our 2020 Strategy while remaining agile and aggressive in our approach to mitigate significant cost headwinds. We grew sales for the year 3% including another strong year of innovation at about 3% of incremental sales, and about a point from the acquisition from Nutranext partially offset by nearly a point of negative impact from the Aplicare divestiture. We feel very good about these results in an environment where growth is very hard to achieve. We are particularly pleased that all major innovations are doing well in markets including Fresh Step Clean Paws, the Clorox Scentiva platform, Burt's Bees cosmetics, Glad trash innovations and our Professional Products Clorox Total 360 System. And while our focus on traditional retailers remains most important, we continue to make strong progress in e-commerce and sales in these channels are estimated to be up more than 40% for the fiscal year. We achieved these results while operating through a volatile cost environment that was significantly worse than anticipated, taken an agile and aggressive approach to mitigate the impact by leaning into cost savings and moving quickly and decisively to announce cost justified price increases. To put this in perspective, we now plan to take price increases on about 50% of our portfolio in fiscal year 2019. We delivered 17% diluted EPS growth for the fiscal year and we put our healthy balance sheet and strong cash flow to work investing in the health of the company, creating a new runway for growth with the Nutranext acquisition and returning cash to shareholders by increasing the dividend by 14% in May 2018 and by entering the market with up to a $2 billion share repurchase program. Second, for fiscal year 2019, we're projecting another year of solid sales growth, as we increase investments to support the business and drive profitable growth in our core and our recent acquisitions. Sales growth will be supported by increased investments in advertising and sales promotion with a focus on digital marketing and innovation. We'll also continue to execute our pricing plans consistent with our focus on driving profitable growth and category growth for our retailers. We continue to have a robust margin accretive innovation plan on many of our brands including Burt's Bees, Fresh Step, Glad trash and Hidden Valley as well as continued investments to support our successful fiscal year 2018 innovations. We remain confident in the long-term outlook for the RenewLife digestive health business and we continue to anticipate about three points of growth from the newest member of our portfolio, the Nutranext vitamins and dietary supplement business where integration is progressing in line with expectations. And from a channel perspective, including Nutranext, e-commerce is now estimated at 6% of company sales and we anticipate growing strongly in this channel again in fiscal year 2019 to an estimated 8% of company sales. Third, as we decisively address near-term pressures, we will not be deterred from our 2020 Strategy and focus on profitable, sustainable and responsible growth to create long-term shareholder value. We continue to take a long-term view and remain confident in our strategy. We are continuing to invest for the future not only through increased brand building investments but also in technology transformation such as with technology enabled consumer engagement and capital investments to enhance our supply chain and support long-term growth through technology. All our major brands are seen as superior by consumers versus their competitive brands. And while we have work to do on some of them, I feel good about the health of our portfolio overall and the plans we have in place to support them and we will maintain our emphasis on driving superior value through a combination of product performance, price and consumer perception. We'll continue to lean into the more profitable parts of our portfolio and focus on expanding the core behind health and wellness with Nutranext and RenewLife as the engines. We'll double down on our focus to restore gross margin growth as we aim to extend our track record of delivering 11 consecutive years of cost savings at $100 million or more. And we will support these efforts by continuing to build a more agile enterprise with highly engaged employees who are keenly focused on growing our business the right way. So, in a difficult cost environment, we continue to have confidence in our 2020 Strategy, as the means to create long-term value for shareholders. Operator, you many now open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Dorer. And we will take our first question today from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hello, everyone. I had a question on your advertising expense. First, it was down a lot in Q4, so hoping you could help us better understand why that was. And then your guidance for organic sales growth in FY 2019 is consistent with what you generated last year despite your expectations for step-up advertising since you're expecting it to go to 10% of sales from 9.3% last year. So I guess I'm wondering if you're finding that you need to spend more to get the same level of growth. Thanks. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Thanks, Bonnie. First on Q4, we'll remind everybody that we have always said that there's going to be quarterly variance. We don't manage the business by quarter. We don't manage the spend by quarter. We're focusing on the long-term, and there is a reason why our guidance is on an annual basis. What I will say on Q4 is that part of it certainly was Charcoal which became clear throughout the quarter was going to be significantly lower in sales, negatively impacting the company by about one point, because of the inventory hangover we had from Q3, which, as you know, was really soft behind the unusually cold weather. And that continued in April which led to lower merchandising throughout the quarter. And we certainly thought that there is no need to spend into that headwind as much as we did last year. What I will tell you though is that for fiscal year 2019, as you noted, we're committed to be about 10% level which is in line with our target. So there's no news here. We're staying the course managing the business for the long-term. And as you related to the sales guidance, what I would ask you is certainly to keep in mind that what we have communicated is that as we take pricing, it typically takes a few quarters for consumers to get used to new price points. We've also commented on the fact that there might be temporarily bumpiness as it relates to merchandising, as we're working through this with retailers. And all of that is reflected in what we think is a really balanced outlook that reflects the upside and the risks that we see in the fiscal year pretty appropriately. So, fiscal year 2019, it's going to be back to 10%. We'll invest in innovation. That is going to contribute another 3% in line with our targets. And we'll also continue to shift our spend towards digital, which as we've noted in the past, accounted for about 50% of our advertising sales promotion spend in fiscal year 2018, and is expected to contribute about 55% to 60% of our total spend in fiscal year 2019, all based on the strong ROIs that we have. So, 10% is the right level now and ongoing. And the 2% to 4% sales guidance that we have given for the fiscal year appropriately reflects what we're seeing in the marketplace, and certainly also reflects the fact that it's early in the year and the environment is somewhat volatile. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Right. Thank you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Thanks, Bonnie. Operator : And the next question will come from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. First question is on Glad pricing, which I know it made a ton of sense on \u2013 whatever I guess nine months ago to roll back that pricing because of the competitive positioning and the competitive activity in the category. But obviously on \u2013 the input environment has changed dramatically. So, how are you thinking about Glad pricing now? Is there a hope for more positive pricing? When do we lap that? Maybe a little bit more discussion about that. Thanks. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Thank you, Wendy. So, what we did, as noted in the past was take a price cut on about 40% of the Glad trash pricing last fall just set the table as we anticipated strong innovation in the back half of last fiscal year and get that value right. As I think is evident in the really strong progress in volume and sales on that business that's achieved its objectives. And we're pleased with the success of the innovation out of the gate. I'm also today announcing that we will take pricing on Glad trash. And I think that should tell you two things : first of all, that we believe in the value of the brand and the products that we offer on Glad as is evidenced by the continued shift towards the more profitable premium end of the business, which now accounts for north of two-third of the entire portfolio in trash. But the second thing that tells you also is that our pricing efforts overall are going in line with plan as is perhaps evidenced by the first business that we announced pricing on in the last quarter, which is Cat Litter which was first out of the gate. And as Lisah mentioned earlier, the higher prices are now visible at shelf at several major retailers, including our largest retailer. So, Glad will take pricing as well bringing the total percentage of our portfolio that we will take pricing on to 50% globally. And that, of course, also includes more of the professional business where we took about a-third pricing on about a-third of the business in the last fiscal year and we're now adding another about 40 percentage points bringing the total amount of the PPD business where we're taking pricing to about 75%. So, strong cost justified case on pricing, our brands continue to offer superior value and we don't expect that to be affected by these price increases. This is a strategic case of allowing us to keep investing in innovation and advertising sales promotion to grow categories. And we'll do a lot of that in fiscal year 2019 and it's all going in line with plan. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's hugely helpful. And can I ask one follow-up kind of just higher level? Clorox is one of the first companies obviously in the group to start raising prices, given the commodity environment. And I'm just wondering, if generally \u2013 I know you said that the response competitively and from retailers is kind of as expected. Did you notice any difference in terms of your price increases going through online versus offline or in traditional channels? This is the first time online benefit factor and you guys have been historically very strong online. So, is there any nuance in terms of hey, given the retail environment has changed, we need to think about pricing or the time it takes effect or the competitive response anything like that in a different light? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: So, no two companies are the same, so I can't speak for the industry. But for our company there's no difference. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Perfect. Thanks so much. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Thanks, Wendy. Operator : And we'll go to Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. So, to build on what you just said \u2013 I agree you've been at the forefront of the industry's effort to drive prices these past several months and you seem pretty determined to carry that forward into 2019. I was just hoping you could maybe step back and provide a few more details on what your experience has been thus far and any color as you look forward on what percentage of list price increases you expect to really show up in the market as an incremental pricing net of kind of promotional offsets and whether you expect that incrementality to differ materially across different product categories as you push for list price. So, I'm just curious. I have no doubt you're going to push the list prices through. I'm just \u2013 my question is really about how much of that will drive true incrementality to the fiscal 2019 P&L? Thanks. Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Yes. Thanks, Steve. So, can't comment on individual percentages because those vary by category and because we're still talking to retailers. But two things perhaps are helpful. First of all, the increases that we're seeing on Cat Litter are precisely in line with our plans. And then perhaps to your broader point, we are not planning to spend any of those price increase dollars back in trade and we also did not do that in fiscal year 2018. So, our expectation is that the pass-through, while pricing certainly is at the discretion of retailers, will be in line with our plans. Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Okay. And then, if I could on guidance. Back of the envelope math, but just given what you said about SG&A and A&P each moving higher, the 2019 outlook really seems dependent on pretty reasonable gross margin improvement, as I look at it, if you think it's a midpoint of your guidance and/or a pretty frontend loaded buyback financed on favorable terms. So maybe, Kevin or Benno, just react to my back of the envelope conclusions? And then in that context, just talk a little bit more about your confidence in seeing true gross margin expansion next year versus gross margins just kind of leveling off? And then, any details you could provide on how you plan to finance and timing the buyback would be great? Thank you. Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Yes, Steve, this is Kevin. I can try to answer some of those questions. So, as it relates to gross margin, clearly, I would say, a couple of things. First, the work we're doing on cost savings I'm very pleased with. We have one of the most robust cost savings pipeline planned for 2019 that I've seen in quite a while. And that's obviously what we attack first to offset the commodity environment we're seeing. Additionally, as Benno talked about with our pricing actions on about half the portfolio, that's the other piece of the model that will allow us to be flat to up modestly. We control those two elements and we feel very comfortable about the work we're doing. What is not directly in our control is the commodity environment and the transportation environment. We certainly expect to see inflation continue in fiscal year 2019. I would say, as it relates to commodities, our expectation is the inflation rate will be fairly similar to what we saw in 2018. And as it relates to transportation, my expectation is while we'll see inflation in 2019, it won't be to the same degree that we saw in 2018, so moderating a bit. And so overall, our belief is that we will be flat to up. I think what's also important though is to think about the phasing, what I really expect in the front half of the year, we really haven't lapped the significant upcharges we saw in fiscal year 2018. So, I would expect the front half of the year to look more in line with what we're seeing in the back half of fiscal year 2018. But by the back half of 2019, we'll see the benefits of cost savings. We'll see the benefits of pricing playing through our P&L. And that's really where I expect to see sequential improvement throughout the year with gross margin expansion in the back half of the year. And then your other question was related to share buybacks. I would tell you, I won't provide a quarterly outlook on the phasing, but we are planning currently to exercise about half of our authorized amount of $1 billion, and we'll do that based on criteria we've set internally over the course of the year. Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Thanks, Steve. Operator : And next is Steve Strycula with UBS. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. Two part question. The first part would be, can you give us some color between the volume and the price mix on an organic basis for, I think you've answered it already, but for the fourth quarter and how we should think about it for the full-year and how it might have broken out by segment. You've done that historically. We just kind of want a little bit of a better feel as to how the underlying businesses are doing on a volume ex acquisition and price basis? Thank you. Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Hi, Steve. This is Kevin. I'll speak to the fourth quarter and full-year for 2019. In the fourth quarter, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we saw about 3% growth from Nutranext. We had volume growth on the base business, and then the headwinds we saw where FX was about 1 point headwind as well as the Aplicare divestiture keep that in mind was about 1 point as well. And then pricing was 1 point benefit, offset by unfavorable mix in assortment. As I look forward to fiscal year 2019, our expectations are as we mentioned innovation will drive about 3 points of growth, the net impact of the Nutranext acquisition and Aplicare divestiture will be about a 2.5 point benefit. And then we are looking at fairly significant devaluation in International, about a 2 point headwind, primarily related to the Argentine peso devaluation we experienced in May and June. As it relates to pricing, expectation right now is pricing will have limited benefit on the sales line. You'll have the benefit of more revenue per case, but that will be offset by the elasticities on volume, as consumers adjust to the new pricing. And so, what I expect to see in fiscal year 2019 is our volume growing more in line with sales. Typically, our volume tends to grow a little bit faster than sales, but I think in 2019 you'll see those growing more in line. Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Company : Is there anything else, Steve? Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. I didn't realize I was getting second question, but I'll take it. So, the second piece would be, Benno, if we went to the midpoint of your organic sales guidance for the full-year and we just thought about the different moving pieces with pricing coming through, what really drives the sensitivity from the low-end versus the high-end? And can things really go your way versus things not going your way? What would be the one or two variables that you would think are most in flux as we think about the balance of the year? Thank you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. I mean look, there's a number of things. So, I'd say, we'd certainly point to FX as one, right, that's a 2 point drag. And obviously, that's very much driven by the Argentine peso, but FX continues to be a headwind. So, I would point to that. And then I would certainly point to the success with the consumer around pricing as the second one, right? So clearly, as I pointed out, so far it's going in line with our expectations. The good news about that is that historically we've been able to model the impact of pricing on volume with the consumer extremely precisely. And what I mean by that is within plus/minus 2% variance. So, our modeling historically has always been good, but pricing on 50% of the portfolio is a significant undertaking. And hence the 2 point range coupled with the FX uncertainty seems very appropriate, but I would point to those two things. Operator : And we'll now go to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. So, I want to follow-up on a couple of questions. One is back to the EBIT being flat, so gross margin is flat to up modestly, which were the words you used. The S&A is going to go to about 14%, which is 40 basis points. The A&P goes up by about 70 basis points to roughly 10%. How do you get to flat EBIT margins? Unless R&D is coming down a lot or modestly means not modestly in terms of gross margin? Or is there something else going on that I don't understand? Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Ali, this is Kevin. What I would say is, obviously, it's still very early in the year, so these are the outlook we provided are ranges around each of those estimates. We'll have to see how the commodity environment plays out. We certainly provided a range around gross margin accretion and we'll have to see where that plays out as well as our admin spending. We said about 14%. Part of that is driven by the Nutranext acquisition and the integration spending we're doing as we're integrating our people, process and systems. And so, I would take those as ranges and we'll have to see how that plays out and we'll clearly update you folks as we move through the year. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So, just to build on that, because clearly gross margin is a little bit of a \u2013 I mean, there wasn't a number given, there's a lot of moving parts obviously, as Benno said, a huge undertaking to take price on 50% of your business. And I think, you said \u2013 I think maybe it was you Kevin just a second ago that you expect volume to be roughly in line with sales for 2019. And if that's right, how does that jive with taking pricing on 50% of your portfolio? Does it go back to the question of \u2013 for now you're going to promote a lot of it back, so we're not actually going to see the pricing, it's going to be a lot of promo spend initially to rash it down? Or is there something else going on? And again, I say that in the context of, I'm trying to put your guidance together here, it's just not working for me. Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. I can speak to the trade spending, as Benno just mentioned, our plans are not to increase trade spending. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: But so how is sales in line with volume? Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Well here's what I'd say, typically when you have high FX like we're projecting for 2019, you'll see volume growing faster than sales and if you look back at our history that's been very true. This year, in spite of the high FX, you have a dampening effect on volume based on elasticity in the near-term and so that's why you'll see volume and sales growing more in line. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. And perhaps, Ali, if I may add, so if you think about Q4, for instance, so at 5% volume growth leading to 3% total sales growth which included 1% negative impact from FX. If you look at the fiscal year 2019 guidance, you see 3% volume growth. And if you take out FX that's \u2013 at the midpoint would be 5% of sales. So, I do think, once you take FX into account you start seeing the difference. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. Okay. And then just on another point, you mentioned, you're taking on the International challenges head on, I think, was the word you used. Can you mention a little bit more kind of leaning out of that business. Are there things more dramatic that you could do to that business? It's clearly been a disappointment, sometimes there's progress, sometimes there's not. Oftentimes it is not the fault of that business unit, given the FX changes et cetera now in Argentina. Do you still think that fits in the portfolio? Are there other things you could do to that business that are more dramatic? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: You know, perhaps I'll give you the broader context and Kevin will add some perspective on Argentina. So, if we think about the International business as a whole, we have as many number one brands in International as we have in the U.S. We have solid plans to offset the cost inflation and we've done that well operationally. We're performing very well as is evidenced by fiscal year 2018 where for the second year in a row we've shown sales and profit growth. So, it's not where we wanted to be, but given the FX headwinds actually performing quite well. So, we're optimistic about that business which is why we're investing into it. But what we've talked about is that we're shifting our investment stance to the more profitable parts of the portfolio. We have four growth vectors in International business and they now account for 30% of our portfolio. And that's up significantly from previous years. So, we're shifting the category country mix quite attractively towards parts of the portfolio that aren't just margin accretive to the International business, but margin accretive to the company. The setback right now and the foot on the brake is Argentina and I'll let perhaps Kevin comment on the specific things we're doing in Argentina. Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Sure. Yeah, Ali as it relates to Argentina, as we've talked about the two point headwind from FX that's primarily driven by Argentina. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, we've seen a 30% devaluation in the Argentine peso in the month of May and June. So you can imagine, we'll have to lap that over the first 10 months of this year. Additionally, our belief is we'll continue to see the peso depreciate versus the dollar marginally over the balance of the year, in addition to what's already occurred in May and June. And so, it's certainly a challenging environment in Argentina. What I would say, though is, we've operated in Argentina for quite a while over 30 years and we have a very experienced team who is very knowledgeable about operating this environment. And so, the team knows exactly what to do in a highly inflationary environment. We're very much focused on protecting profit. There's less you can do about the top-line, but certainly our focus are on protecting profit. And I think the team has developed some nice plans for 2019 to do just that, in spite of the challenging currency environment. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks so much, guys. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Sure. Thanks, Ali. Operator : And we'll go to Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Wanted to talk a little bit about mix. Because obviously, this quarter, the mix was negative in all the division. So trying to understand first what's \u2013 we have embedded in terms of the impact of mix next year? And what are the key things that are driving that down this year? And does that improve over time? Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Hi, Olivia. This is Kevin. I can take that one and speak a little bit about mix. Little bit different drivers for each of our segments. If you think about the Cleaning segment, we continue to have very strong club performance. And as you know, with the larger size there's a little bit of negative mix there when you're growing significantly in club. In Household, as Benno mentioned, we've had a weaker Charcoal business this year. Charcoal is very profitable and high revenue business for us, so that's created some unfavorable mix in Household. And then Lifestyle is a bit interesting. Nutranext has a lower revenue per case for us, but its margin accretive to the company. So while it's a little bit of negative mix of the top-line, we're very happy to have that negative mix in Lifestyle segment, as it relates to Nutranext. And so, we've got a few different drivers. As I look forward, clearly Charcoal is not something we expect to see continuing on, in fiscal year 2019, but I would expect to see some of that in the Nutranext, our Lifestyle segment, given the mix of that business. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. And then on the price increase, it's great to see that 50% of the portfolio is being helped by that. But, I have to ask what's going on in the other 50%? Perhaps a portion of that just doesn't need pricing, but how much of that are areas where you just wouldn't be comfortable pricing, because of the competitive positioning or market dynamics? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Well, keep in mind that the 50% is our new price increases. What's not included there is the PPD portfolio that we took pricing on in fiscal year 2018 and also CDW and that takes you to about 70% of the total portfolio. And I think that, on pricing our glass is more than have full, and I'd love to focus on the 70% that we're taking pricing. I'd also say that pricing continues to be something that we'll review constantly on all the businesses and that's up to the general managers to make the right decisions as far as whether to take pricing or not and when to take pricing. And we certainly, as we contemplate pricing moves keep cost justification in mind very strongly. We want to make sure that we are on solid ground there. And we keep the value proposition that we offer to consumers in mind as well. We have talked for several years now about our deep commitments to offering products and brands that offer superior value to consumers. And in the face of pricing, that's when that commitment to value is being tested. And what I can tell you is that that commitment is as strong after the price increases as it is before the price increases. And with help from strong brand investments, with help from innovation, and marketing plans that engage consumers. We're confident that The Clorox Company's brands will continue to offer better value to consumers, no matter whether we take pricing on 70% of the portfolio or not at this point on 30% of the portfolio. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Fair enough. And if I could just ask one last thing on \u2013 just a quick one on manufacturing logistics, do you think the worst is over because that was a nice sort of lifting of the pressure relative to \u2013 in Q4 relative to Q3? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, Olivia. What I would say is certainly on transportation, we think we saw the high watermark in fiscal 2018. While I do think it's still an inflationary environment, I don't expect to see the type of rate increases we saw in 2018. I would expect transportation in the mid to high-single-digit rate increases. And last year, we're experiencing high-double-digit increases. And so, I think we've done some nice things to get to a lower level of inflation on transportation. And then our manufacturing as well, manufacturers \u2013 manufacturing expense can move around by quarter as we invest in our supply chain, but I'd expect a similar amount on an annual basis what we saw in 2018. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Thanks, Olivia. Operator : Next is Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Good morning. Thanks very much. Two questions. First, where \u2013 both in terms of where you are now and what you're expecting for 2019, can you give us an update on the Burt's Bees cosmetics rollout, where you are in distribution, kind of growth rate? It may be at least characterized how that is relative to your expectations, and how it's contributing, and how that paces over 2019? And secondly, I wanted to follow-up. I'll probably ask this question five ways in my career. Maybe I'll get it right this time. But, a comment that Kevin made about the pacing of cost savings plans caught my ear. I guess I'm just kind of wondering like how \u2013 you have a great pipeline you mentioned. I'm wondering like is that pipeline discretionary at this point, where you feel like you have more like you kind of pace that out to kind of manage any kind of inflationary pressure you might see in the future? Or is it the case that you're pushing as hard as you can and there are some real kind of mechanical business factors that prevent you from getting all that cost savings all at once? Thank you. Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, Jonathan. This is Kevin. I'll take the cost savings. And I'll let Benno talk about the Burt's Bees question. As it relates to cost savings, what I can tell you is I'm very pleased with the program we have in place for fiscal year 2019. In fact, it's one of the strongest cost savings pipeline I've seen over the last several years. And that's really needed, as we're facing a fairly challenging commodity environment. We are leaning into cost savings. That's both a combination of all the good work we do within the supply chain and also part of our admin productivity initiatives. And so, we have a long track record of delivering cost savings. We are absolutely leaning in this year to offset the headwinds and I'm very pleased with the progress we're making for the year. Benno, you want to talk to Burt's Bees? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. For a moment I thought you'll take the Burt's Bees question, it would have been entertaining. The cosmetics launch is performing well. As Lisah has noted earlier, this is a launch that's building over multiple quarters, which is driven by two things. First of all, retailer shelf presets timings, but also our commitments to be disciplined in this, we don't want to get hung up in some of the industry dynamics in cosmetics. We want to make sure that we're disciplined and that we're driving this based on solid SKU velocities and with the right amount of SKUs and complexity, but one way perhaps how you can see that we're confident in this future platform is the launch of liquid lipsticks now, which we're really excited about, because it's a fast growing segment and one where we have a great product. I feel good about the consumer receptivity and the reviews online, which you can see. So, we feel like we have a nice multiyear growth platform in cosmetics. We'll tell you though that as we've always said that the Burt's Bees discussion wouldn't be complete without us mentioning that it's only one growth runway. The biggest and most important thing on Burt's Bees continues to be lip and face and those businesses continue to do extremely well. And as Lisah noted earlier in her remarks, we're particularly proud that for the first time in Q4 our lip balm as of 20-plus years in the market is now number one in the overall lip balm category. And that's a sizeable accomplishment, but it's still a pretty fragmented market. And we think that there is a lot more growth to be had there. And we've also commented on International as profitable and attractive growth platform growing double-digits in Q4. So in Burt's Bees, I would want to make sure that we always keep in mind that we have multiple growth platforms and that we have confidence in all of them. With lip balm still continuing to be the biggest single opportunity we have in this business, which is why a substantial amount of the investments will still go again to lip balm. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thank you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Thanks, Jonathan. Operator : Next is Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thank you for let me ask questions. A few housekeeping items kind of run through quickly. You mentioned expectations for manufacturing logistics for next year. It's stepped down quite a bit, just in terms of magnitude and headwind in the fourth quarter. Anything notable changed there? Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: No, Jason. This is Kevin. I wouldn't identify anything notable. I think as we called out, we did have some investments in the supply chain back in Q2 for our new Home Care facility. So, it's a little bit elevated in Q2. But as I said, it can move from quarter-to-quarter based on timing of our investments. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. The volume growth for next year, the roughly 3%, how much is the M&A component in that? In other words, what's your organic volume expectation? Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: We don't provide that Jason, so I would stick to our overall growth rate that we provided, but we don't break it out that way. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. In terms of Charcoal sales, you're kind of attributing, I get the unfavorable weather early on. I have a harder time wrapping the head around, why category sales would be so weak on weaker merchandising. It doesn't seem to be such an expandable or contractable consumption category or impulse-oriented category to me. Help me understand that dynamic a little bit more. And can you give us little more context as to why retailers may have pulled back on the category, even after weather turned? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, good point, Jason. So, actually it is expandable which is the whole premise of the category so, you see a display in store and makes you want to grill and you buy Charcoal. And while you do that you also buy a whole bunch of other things whether that's your beverage of choice or meat and chips and things that you want for a family afternoon. And that's why retailers have been and are so interested in supporting this category, and that's been the hallmark of our strategy to continue to provide more occasions for grilling and extend the season so that passionate grillers can spend more time grilling and we get more volume from those. So, less merchandising in the category, right? So not just a brand, but in the category has led to category softness. And that's certainly something that's \u2013 if I categorize this for you and if I look at the quarter, the bulk of the volume softness was weather \u2013 yeah and the inventory hangover from Q3, which was also weather-related, so just to put it in perspective. But the less merchandising contributed and that's because of the lower merchandising levels at several retailers. That's not something that's new. We see changes in retail or merchandising strategies every single year and sometimes they work like gangbusters and sometimes they work less well. And this certainly is a year where the changes have been less successful, which is why we're focused on three things. First of all, the basic premise of extending the season and making sure that people have a chance to grill year round with the weather conditions in many parts of the country continues to be the right strategy for business like coal. And since this season we've had a partnership with Major League Baseball in place around games and tailgating and online marketing that connects, if you will, America's favorite Charcoal with America's favorite pastime. And MLB baseball has its peak in October and we'd love for Charcoal grilling \u2013 for that to be true for Charcoal grilling as well. We are working with retailers on the right merchandising strategies. Again that's not something that's new to us and something that we're very comfortable with. We need to get that right and do better for next season. And I think that's something that retailers understand. And obviously, there's a mutual benefit for that. And then we're also focusing on millennials where we see an opportunity to educate them on grilling, because there's somewhat of a barrier. You don't want to look foolish, and you want to look like somebody who is knowledgeable grilling. And when you're just learning how to grill, there's a little bit of a barrier, and we're helping people through education mainly online to cross that barrier. If I put that all in context, certainly coal needs to do better. Feel good about the rest of the portfolio as I mentioned in my earlier remarks. And I'd look at this perhaps as \u2013 while it's something I can't control because of weather, the continuation of what we saw in Litter, which two years ago was a real problem child, and is now, if not the best performing business, one of the best performing businesses for sure. Last year's problem child was Brita and we're pleased to see that return to growth. And it looks like this season it's Charcoal. So feel good about the portfolio, even though it's not perfect. But to be honest, if everything was perfect we'd have nowhere to go. And I'd rather have a few clear action steps that we know how to address and coal is the one this year. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Very good. I've lots other questions but I'll pass it on for the sake of time. Thank you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Thanks, Jason. Operator : And we'll go to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just had a question about kind of retailer dynamics, right? So part of the big conversation across the industry, of course, has been retailer receptiveness to pricing, not just the consumer impact. And you guys have long talked about the idea that for companies that are innovating and driving growth if the retail relationship can be in a good spot as it has been for the last couple of years. Anything that you can share now on how that may have evolved as the ask for pricing across the industry is getting a lot more broader, more companies asking for it even though that may be haven't been quite as innovative or driving as much category growth. Anything you can offer on that broad industry perspective in terms of retailers and the understanding of the price that needs to be showing up on shelf would be great. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Thanks, Lauren. You could speak for Clorox perhaps more so than for the industry. Several things are important in order to do pricing effectively. The first thing is, as I've said earlier, it's got to be cost justified, right? So all our price increases are cost justified. And we're pretty transparent with retailers and truthful, of course, with retailers, because they see what we see in terms of cost. The second thing that matters certainly is to have leading brands that offer better value for consumers. If you have that pricing discussions with retailers, which are never easy, because they want to make sure that you're doing the right thing. But they are going to be more productive than in situations where you perhaps don't offer better value where you don't have leading brands and where your spot in the markets is less clearly defined. More than 80% of our portfolio are number one brands. The majority offer better value, so we're in a pretty good shape there. Lastly though, I think retailers understand that not taking pricing simply isn't an option for a company like Clorox in this cost environment, and that there's a fundamental choice between either not taking pricing and then cutting spending and that leads to a downward spiral that I think is evident to all of us from some of the industries in our space. That's not going to lead to long-term success. The alternative for Clorox and we think the only right alternative is to be able to continue to invest in your brands, to be able to continue to invest in innovation and to take pricing as a means to afford that. And as we talk to retailers about our pricing plans we spend a large amount of time to also talk about our plans to grow their categories, our plans to have innovation in the categories that we take pricing in. And I would certainly look at that as a big part of what makes pricing discussions with retailers productive. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. That's really helpful. And the last bit was just to be clear and I apologize if you feel like you've already answered this. But the pricing you've talked about the 50% of the portfolio in 2019 how much of that has been announced to the trade so just in terms of the absolute visibility with what's built into the outlook? Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Just to make sure, Lauren so your question is how much of the 50% has been announced to the trade? Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Just to make sure like \u2013 I mean I have no doubt that this pricing will show up on shelves as you've planned and intentioned, but I just wasn't sure how much is still like on the comp for you to discuss the specifics of retail partners versus your very good visibility on how that comes to shelf and when and so on vis-\u00e0-vis the outlook. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. So, internally we have very good visibility as to when that will be visible at shelf and we've commented on the fact that Litter was the one out first. But in general, given that many of the discussions are still go on with retailers at this point I'd prefer not to comment on specifics on percentages, but we'll just have to let it play out in market and hope you can understand that, Lauren. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Of course. Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : And next is Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Hey. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Thanks for fitting me in. Question, Benno on the sales growth guidance, so it seems to imply organic sales growth of about 2.5% at the midpoint excluding FX and acquisitions and divestitures relative to the company's 3% to 5% long-term target. So understanding that the composition is going to be start to embed more price than we saw in fiscal 2018, can you talk about underlying category growth implied in the outlook? Any sort of market share and vision that's implied there and how that compares to fiscal 2018? And I guess I asked that in the context that Nielsen category growth weighting based on the \u2013 your product category suggests something sort of flattish at the moment. And I'd make a couple points, number one Charcoal is probably at least 0.5 point drag. And I know the hope is if that's going to get better. And I also understand we're not capturing online and non-track including club. But it would seem to imply perhaps an acceleration relative to what we saw in 2018. So any commentary there on the guide and market share outlook would be helpful. Thank you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. So, I don't know that we reconcile it with that detail, Kevin, but in general, what we are seeing is that category dollars are pretty constant if you look at track channels, so we don't expect any change there. We also continue to see faster growth in non-track channels and I wouldn't expect to see any change there. So in terms of categories they're pretty robust. And we expect that to continue. No change. In terms of market shares \u2013 look it's our ambition to grow market shares right? It's one important metric for us. It's not the only important consumer metric to us. You've also heard us talk about our Consumer Value Measure and about household penetration as a really important metrics that we're doing well on. What typically does happen in a year when you take pricing is that temporarily you will give a little bit on market shares. And that's as consumers are adjusting to price increases, that's also recognition of the fact that as was noted by some of the earlier, we've been out front on pricing. And I think in all of our categories so there's a little bit of a time lag, perhaps if competitors follow until they follow and until that shows up in market, all of that will create some noise on market shares, but we're very committed to growing market shares in the long run. I'd expect us to grow market shares. What that would look like over the next 12 months? We'll have to see. But \u2013 expect our categories to continue to do pretty well. We've historically not seen much change in categories post-price increases and we don't expect that to be the case this time either. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Okay, Benno. So, it sounds like implicitly your 2.5% underlying organic sales growth is relatively close to what you think the industry is going to do. Is that fair? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: I guess, I'd struggle saying yes or no, because I haven't done the math. I mean if you try to pinpoint to a blanket statement, I would say yes. But I would give that a qualifier. Is that okay? Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : That's good enough. Good luck. And thank you for the comments. I appreciate it. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Thanks, Kevin. Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Company : We'll take one more question after this. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you for squeezing me in. Hello, everybody. So just a clarification on the volume and the mix effect for Nutranext. And if you do the math I mean obviously you gave us the components. But just, if you have to assume any mix effect for Nutranext going into next year like for this following fiscal year. And also related to that, in some ways, like I remember like RenewLife had a lot of distribution gains. How far are you from that? And if you kind of also embed Nutranext in that comment? Thank you. Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Hi, Andrea, this is Kevin. I can certainly take your question on Nutranext mix. We don't provide mix at the SBU level. But what I'd tell you is what we saw in Q4 as it relates to Nutranext, I'd expect to see a consistent impact as we go forward. That business is still relatively small in the overall portfolio of Clorox. It won't be that material to the company. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. And on the distribution gains, like should we embed it in the 2% to 4%. And the 2.5% organic that we discussed just now? That is embedding some distribution gains for Lifestyle and for Digestive Health? Or not much? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Obviously, one of the premises that we had when acquiring the Nutranext business was that through our strong sales capabilities we would be able to expand distribution. So that's very much the plan, Andrea. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you, Benno. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would now like to turn the program back to you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Thank you, everyone, and hope you have a good rest of the day. And I look forward to speaking with you in November when we share our first quarter results. Thank you. Operator : And thank you very much. That does conclude our conference for today. I'd like to thanks everyone for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.: Thank you, Todd, and welcome, everyone. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, our Chairman and CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com. On today's call, we'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA, and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliations with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available on our website, as well as in our SEC filings. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release. Please also recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. I would direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the impact of tax legislation. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcome to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn to our top line commentary and I'll start by covering our Q1 top line performance discussing highlights in each of our segments. Kevin will then address our financial results, as well as updated outlook for the fiscal year. Finally, we'll turn to Benno to offer his perspective and then close with Q&A. For the total company, Q1 sales grew 4% on top of 4% growth in the year-ago quarter. First quarter sales results also reflect the impact of 2 points of unfavorable foreign currency and about 3 points of benefit from the Nutranext acquisition, net of Aplicare divestiture. I'll now go through our results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q1 sales grew 2%, behind the continued momentum in our largest business unit, Home Care, partially offset by about a point of negative impact from the divestiture of Aplicare. Home Care delivered solid sales growth in the quarter, behind strong shipments in a number of Clorox-branded products and from ongoing innovation within our Clorox Scentiva platform, which just launched another new fragrance, Fresh Brazilian Blossom. We announced price increases on a portion of the Home Care portfolio last quarter, which took effect in August. While still very early, we're pleased to report that pass-through and competitive reactions are generally in line with our expectations. In our Laundry business, sales declined slightly mainly due to lapping the lift from the impact of the hurricanes in the year-ago quarter. Importantly, as was in the case of Home Care, our price increases in this business are also progressing in line with expectations. Lastly, within our Cleaning segment, our Professional Products sales were flat due to the Aplicare divestiture. Excluding the impact of Aplicare, this business delivered high-single digit sales growth, behind volume gains across all three of its segments : Cleaning, Healthcare and Food. Key products focused on stopping the spread of infection, including Clorox hydrogen peroxide wipes and sprays and Clorox Fuzion sprays, each recorded strong double-digit growth. In addition, Clorox Disinfecting Wipes had double-digit growth even with a price increase. Turning to the Household segment, Q1 sales were flat as gains in Cat Litter were mainly offset by declines in Charcoal and to a lesser extent Glad and RenewLife. Our Cat Litter business delivered double-digit sales growth reflecting the benefit of price increases we took on July 1 and continued strong shipments of Fresh Step Clean Paws innovation. Our Cat Litter business continues to show strong momentum having recorded eight consecutive quarters of market share growth. Charcoal sales decreased double-digits due to lower consumptions. We're putting aggressive plans in place for the 2019 grilling season and stepping up our brand building programs to re-energize existing consumers, as well as bring new consumers into the category. This season, you'll see significant packaging upgrades that include new sizes and stronger claims. We're also launching 100% hardwood briquettes to address some consumer preferences for different grilling methods. Importantly, we're focused on partnering with our retailers to aggressively merchandise Kingsford, including extending the grilling season which has worked so well in driving the category growth for many years. In conjunction with these plans, we're taking a cost-justified price increase in December. This will raise the overall value for the category, allowing us to reinvest in brand building, including innovation, that will maintain the superior value of Kingsford brand. In Glad bags and wraps, Q1 sales decreased due to lower shipments of food containers and wrap. At the same time, the Glad trash business, which accounts for more than 75% of Glad's annual shipments, remain healthy with our premium OdorShield bags growing high-single digits. We're also supporting this business with a new ad campaign, Game Day, which ran on TV, digital and print for the first time in mid-September, touting the durability of our Glad ForceFlex Plus Advanced Protection trash bags. Finally, turning to RenewLife. Sales declined this quarter due to lower consumption in the Natural Channel as we lost market share following out of stocks due to the supply chain challenges we experienced last summer. Our priority now is to reengage consumers and reclaim shelf space. We'll do this by focusing on two things. First, we'll aggressively emphasize the superior value proposition of our brand through both new packaging and new claims, as well as through innovation that is meaningful to the fastest-growing value segment in the category. Second, we'll continue to lean into e-commerce, the fastest-growing channel for the category, where we're growing market share. In our Lifestyle segment, Q1 sales increased 26%, mainly reflecting the benefit of Nutranext acquisition. While still early, we're pleased with the progress on the integration and then the initial start of the business. The increase in sales within this segment also reflects growth in Food, Brita and Burt's Bees business units. In our Food business, sales grew strongly behind higher consumption, as well as distribution gains by the Hidden Valley dry dressing and continued momentum on Hidden Valley bottle dressings. The Hidden Valley equity continued to gain share for the 15th consecutive quarter. We also took a price increase on dry Hidden Valley products in August, which is progressing in line with expectations. Brita grew sales this quarter, mainly behind strong merchandising during the back-to-college post period. Positively, we're seeing improvement in both shares and consumption. We're pleased to see progress behind innovation, as well as ongoing investment in the brand. Burt's Bees sales were up for the quarter. Our lip care and face care businesses performed especially well, with both recording double-digit sales growth and lip care recording its 17th consecutive quarter of share growth. This is a reflection of a healthy core business, fueled by continued stream of innovation. We're also launching our first-ever TV advertising campaign in support of our face care line. Beyond the core, our color cosmetics business, which launched a year ago, continues to be on track with expectations. We're also taking pricing on about 40% of our portfolio, most of which will take effect in February. Finally, turning to International. Q1 sales decreased 5% as the benefit of price increases and volume growth were more than offset by about 12 points of unfavorable foreign currency impact, mainly due to the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso. In the face of these headwinds, we're now taking additional price increases in Argentina to mitigate the country's worsening foreign exchange environment. We continue to execute our Go Lean strategy across International, which is helping us rebuild margins through pricing and cost savings initiatives, while selectively investing in margin-accretive parts of our International portfolio that has tailwinds. In Q1, that focus yielded double-digit volume growth in Burt's Bees International and RenewLife Canada. Now I'll turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss our first quarter financial performance and updated outlook for FY 2019. Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Thank you, Lisah, and good morning, everyone. We're off to a solid start in the fiscal year, delivering strong sales and earnings growth, while continuing to generate healthy cash flow. As you saw in our press release, we have adjusted our fiscal year earnings outlook, largely based on our expectations to repurchase fewer shares in the open market this fiscal year and because of somewhat stronger-than-expected currency and cost pressures. Importantly, our strategic initiatives are helping to offset much of the currency and cost headwinds. We remain on track to deliver gross margin accretion in the second half of the fiscal year, and we are maintaining our sales outlook. I'll provide further perspective on our full-year outlook in a moment. Turning to our financial results for the first quarter. In the first quarter, sales grew 4%, which included 2 points of negative foreign currency impact and about 3 points of net benefit from the Nutranext acquisition and Aplicare divestiture. First quarter volume grew in line with sales. Gross margin for the quarter came in at about 43%, a decrease of 150 basis points compared to about 45% in the year-ago quarter. First quarter gross margin included 280 basis points of unfavorable manufacturing and logistics costs and 130 basis points of unfavorable commodity costs. This is partially offset by 130 basis points of cost savings, as well as 90 basis points of benefit from pricing. Selling, administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were flat versus the year-ago quarter. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales were equal to the year-ago quarter, with spending for our U.S. retail business at about 10% of sales. Our first quarter effective tax rate came in at 22% versus 31% in the year-ago quarter, largely reflecting the benefit of U.S. tax reform. Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.62, an increase of 11%. Turning to cash flow. For the quarter, net cash provided by continuing operations came in at $259 million, about flat versus year-ago quarter. Free cash flow as a percentage of sales came in strongly at 14.3%. Also as previously communicated, we initiated our open market share repurchase program of up to $2 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, we utilized about 4% of the total authorization amount of the repurchase program. And since the inception of our program, we have now returned roughly 9% of our total authorization to shareholders. As a result of our first quarter activity, we will likely repurchase less than our initial plan of about $1 billion in fiscal year 2019. Now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2019 outlook. We continue to expect fiscal year sales [growth] to be in the range of 2% to 4%. While we are maintaining our sales outlook, it does reflect a more pronounced devaluation of the Argentine peso. To help offset this, we are taking more pricing in our Argentina business. Importantly, while still early, our U.S. pricing actions are broadly in line with expectations and, in a few cases, going better than planned. We have also recently announced additional cost-justified pricing actions on our Burt's Bees and Charcoal businesses. Turning to gross margin. We now expect fiscal year gross margin to be about flat, reflecting the benefits of pricing and cost savings, offset by the impacts related to increased currency and cost pressures. As of now, we continue to believe we are on track to deliver gross margin accretion in the back half of fiscal year 2019. We continue to expect fiscal year advertising and sales promotion spending to be about 10% of sales. Additionally, we continue to anticipate selling and administrative expenses to come in at about 14% of sales, buying productivity programs to help address ongoing cost pressures. Selling and administrative expenses also continue to assume acquisition-related investments and more normalized levels for performance-based incentive compensation. We now anticipate fiscal year EBIT margin to be down, reflecting flat gross margin, as well as increased investments in advertising and the Nutranext integration. Our outlook also continues to include the benefits of U.S. tax reform, with the ongoing assumption that our fiscal year tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. We continue to expect free cash flow for fiscal year 2019 to come in at about 11% to 13% of sales. Net of all these factors, fiscal year diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $6.20 to $6.40, versus our previous range of $6.32 to $6.52. Our updated EPS range is primarily driven by a revised expectation for open market share repurchases and, to a lesser extent, more pronounced currency and cost headwinds. Our updated range also continues to include our previously communicated estimate of $0.08 to $0.12 of EPS dilution from the Nutranext acquisition. In addition, the $0.05 to $0.07 of negative impact from tariffs, which are affecting a couple of our business units. In response to the challenging currency and cost environment, I believe we are taking the right actions to begin rebuilding gross margin in the back half of the fiscal year. First, we continue to execute our pricing plans, including a recent announcement on Burt's Bees and coal. Importantly, given the significant currency devaluation in Argentina, we are also planning more price increases in our Argentina business. Second, we are continuing to lean into our agile enterprise initiatives to drive cost savings and enhance productivity. And, finally, we are continuing to execute our Go Lean strategy in International. We are pleased with our progress, which contributed to profit growth in the first quarter. In closing, we are staying the course with our 2020 Strategy. We will continue to lean into key elements of our strategy to address near-term currency and cost pressures, while investing to sustain the health of our core business and deliver long-term shareholder value. And with that, I will turn it over to Benno. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Thanks, Kevin. Hello, everyone, and thanks for being on the call today. I'm pleased to start our fiscal year with strong sales and earnings growth, notwithstanding a constant currency environment that's somewhat tougher than anticipated. That said, I feel good about our execution and progress against the things we can control, including our innovation and pricing plans and cost savings programs. And I feel good about our ability to grow gross margins in the back half of the fiscal year. Importantly, as much as we're focused on addressing these headwinds near-term, I want to emphasize that we won't compromise our investment in our 2020 Strategy and our pursuit of long-term profitable growth. Here are our three themes for the quarter. First, Clorox continues to deliver growth in a tough environment by investing in brands that consumers love. Winning with consumers is why we are growing, and it is certainly the key to sustaining that growth over the long-term. Our relentless focus on delivering superior consumer value through market-leading innovation like Fresh Step Clean Paws litter, Clorox Scentiva products and Glad premium trash bags is differentiating our products and our brands. As expected, Nutranext contributed strongly to our first quarter results, and our integration efforts are on track. Nutranext's leading brands, Rainbow Light, Natural Vitality, Neocell and Stop Aging Now, are off to a strong start in the fiscal year. Leaning into digital also continues to pay off. We're seeing ongoing strong ROI from digital engagements, which is expected to represent more than 50% of our media spend this fiscal year. We're also seeing sustained momentum in e-commerce across a number of brands, and continue to expect e-commerce to be about 8% of company sales this fiscal year. Importantly, in this tough constant currency environment, we're committed to investing strongly in our brands, including innovation, to drive household penetration and superior consumer value. We are investing to sustain successful fiscal-year 2018 innovations and preparing for several major new product introductions in the back half of this fiscal year. Second, our strategic plans are helping to mitigate stronger near-term costs and foreign currency pressures. We are leaving no stone unturned in our efforts to rebuild margin. We'll continue to have robust, margin-accretive innovation plans on many of our brands in the U.S. and in International. And as Kevin mentioned, we'll continue to lean into our agile initiatives to drive cost savings. Year-in and year-out, Clorox has delivered more than $100 million in cost savings, and this year will be no exception. We're also encouraged by our progress in International. While we're seeing more significant currency devaluation in Argentina, our team has been doing a good job executing against our Go Lean strategy to improve the long-term profitability of our International business. Importantly, I am very pleased that early results of our pricing actions are strong. A true measure of a brand's strength is the premium it can command. With number one and number two brands making up for more than 80% of our sales and our track record of strong pricing execution, we were confident to lean into pricing early. We continue to have constructive dialogue with our retailers and initial consumption has been positive. We're also executing pricing plans for Burt's Bees and Kingsford businesses. And in light of the more significant currency devaluation in Argentina, we're planning to take more pricing in our International business as well. Finally, we remain committed to investing in long-term shareholder value. As I look at our global portfolio, I feel great about the continued strength we're seeing across so many of our businesses. We're seeing strong performance in Home Care and litter. Burt's Bees core business is growing nicely and we're seeing ongoing improvements in Brita. In addition, our Professional Products and International businesses are fundamentally healthy. Clearly, we're not happy with persisting soft consumption on Charcoal, even after weather-related headwinds have subsided. If there is one brand, however, we know that's loved by consumers, it's Kingsford. We need to and will put better plans in place to grow household penetration as a way to improve consumption. We did this recently for Cat Litter, which is now one of our star performers. And with the right plans, I believe we can turn the Charcoal business around. Importantly, as I mentioned earlier, in our focus to address constant currency pressures, we will not compromise investments behind our 2020 Strategy. We'll continue to invest in technology, to engage consumers online, and to evolve our supply chain and how we innovate. We'll lean into portfolio momentum and invest disproportionately behind the more profitable brands in our portfolio that benefit from strong headwinds. And, finally, we'll continue to invest in our robust cost savings programs in the U.S. and in International. So before we take your questions, I want to reiterate that I have every confidence in our 2020 Strategy to help us navigate proper currency and cost pressures, while guiding us to achieve long-term shareholder value creation. I have confidence in the strength of our leading brands that are delivering superior consumer value. And, finally, I have confidence in the leadership of Clorox people as we strive to continue to drive strong results the right way. And with that, operator, you may now open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Dorer We'll take our first question from Joe Altobello of Raymond James. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning. So first question \u2013 and it's probably a little bit fairly obvious \u2013 but why was there lesser purchase activity in the quarter? It seems like it's pretty straightforward. And maybe as a follow-on to that, I guess your guide this year was $1 billion in repo. You did $80 million or so in the first quarter. What's the new guide for total repurchase this year? Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Hi, Joe. Yeah, I can address that question. What I'd tell you is maybe just to reconnect where we started with this program. So as I think many of you folks know, we initiated this program back in May. And, at the time, we started pretty significant rerating of the sector. And based on the confidence, both Benno and I and the board have in our 2020 strategy, we felt it was the right time to initiate the program. In Q4, we executed about 5% of our authorization. And then, this quarter, Joe, as you mentioned, we returned about $78 million of cash to our shareholders, about 4% of the authorization. What I would tell you is I commit to be very disciplined in the execution of this program. We have very specific criteria that we execute against that I won't share publicly, and that really drives our activities. And so, if you look at our performance to-date, we've now executed about 9% of the total authorization at about an average price of $129. So, again, I feel very good about our progress, although I'd say it's certainly less than I anticipated back in August. And because of that, our progress in Q1 I think is appropriate to update the investor community that I don't anticipate we'll complete the $1 billion. I think it just means that it'll take a little longer to execute. By design, this was not an ASR, so we'll maintain control over the timing and make smart decisions for investors. And then, I think because of that, as you saw, we reduced our EPS outlook by $0.12. I would tell you about 70% to 75% of the reduction in our EPS outlook was driven by our revised assumption on the share repurchase program. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. That's very helpful, Kevin. Thank you. And then, maybe secondly on Charcoal, how confident are you the decline you're seeing is purely weather and merchandising? And how do we square the commentary, Benno, with respect to those two issues and then the need to increase household penetration to drive growth? Thanks. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Joe. Good afternoon. So clearly consumption continues below expectation, and that's post weather. So our commentary this quarter was that the weather-related softness that we saw earlier this calendar year certainly persisted. So now you know I would say that it's no longer just weather and that what we're seeing is recently lower household penetration. My perspective would be on this business that it continues to be a solid category. People love grilling, millennials love grilling. It's a great brand that people love, that maintains a 75% all out (00:27:15) market share. And, frankly, it's been a solid growth contributor to the company over the last 10 years. And we've had, for a long time, a really strong track record driving consumption through innovation by focusing on extending the grilling season, which used to be sort of between Memorial Day and Labor Day activity. And now, with the help of activities, for instance, centered around the National Football League, we've been able to extend the season to become a year-round activity in many states around the country. So what we're focused on now though is significantly strengthening our plans for the 2019 grilling season with this new focus on bringing new consumers back into the category to drive household penetration back up. And we're doing that with, as Lisah mentioned in her remarks, a significant improvement of our packaging, including new claims and graphics, new advertising, meaningful innovation. And we're working with retailers on, certainly, stronger merchandising plans for calendar year 2019. As you know, 2018 was somewhat hampered by bad weather. So with that, I would say, with the right focus, I'm confident that we can turn this business around. I look at Kingsford at this year's Cat Litter, if you allow me to make that comparison. And we had a similar discussion a while ago on Cat Litter and what we said is that we understand the issues and we're moving swiftly. We will be focused on earning consumers back and not buying consumers back and stay disciplined, and that's exactly what we're doing. And as you know, litter today is one of our star performers. And we need to get Kingsford back on track, but the team is focused and I expect us to do better. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Benno. Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.: Take the next question. Operator, are you still there? Operator : We'll take our next question from Steve Powers [Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.]. Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: You guys there? Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.: Yes. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Hi, Steve. Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Hey, Lisa; hey, Benno, Kevin. Can you just remind size for us, especially with the incremental pricing that you've announced or talked about today? Just what percentage of your domestic portfolio you've now taken price on and what percentage in aggregate you now plan to take price on over the course of the fiscal year? Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Sure, Steve. This is Kevin. What we communicated back in August is that we'd be pricing about 50% of our portfolio. Through Q1, we've now priced approximately 35% of our portfolio. And as both myself and Benno mentioned, we will be executing pricing actions on our Burt's Bees and Charcoal business, which will take effect in our third quarter, which would really complete the full 50% of the portfolio. Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks so much. And then, I know upfront, in Lisa's comments, you talked about that both the pass-through and the competitive reaction to that pricing has generally been in line with expectation so far. But acknowledging it's still early days, just I'd love a little bit more commentary on that. Because from what we're seeing in the Nielsen data at least, it looks like you've been broadly successful in getting that pricing onto shelf, which is good. But if we take a category like Cat Litter, for example, which I think was an early target for you on price or even bleach, the headline data would suggest competitors aren't necessarily following like-for-like, which has been costing you market share at least from volumetric perspective. So just a little bit more color around the reactions to your pricing that you've been seeing across categories. And then, any comments on Cat Litter or bleach specifically would be great as well? Thanks. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yes. So first a clarification. So market share in litter and bleach is up in both businesses, so I think that feels like an important clarification. But on the overall price activity, again, we characterize the progress to be really strong. Our sell-through is largely complete on the businesses that we've announced before, and we've now moved on to Burt's Bees and Kingsford, which is underway. Consumption, as you stated, Steve, going in line with expectation or slightly better. If I look at Cat Litter, we grew volume on Cat Litter and we grew on top, frankly, of a very strong year ago and we grew sales significantly in the double-digits. I would also point to Home Care, where we took pricing on a number of businesses. We grew share last month. The Toilet Bowl Cleaner business is one example where we took pricing and sales \u2013 volume on those two businesses is up double-digits. So this is an activity that plays out across the fiscal year. We certainly went out ahead of competitors, as I think many of you have duly noted. We leaned into pricing and implemented it quickly based on the strength of our brand portfolio. And perhaps greater confidence in our ability to execute and execute quickly, and the strong analytics capability that we have. And we're now starting to see some competitors follow, whether that's in litter or that's in Home Care. And this will play out throughout the fall and throughout the fiscal year. We're playing the long game here. But clearly out of the gate, pricing execution and progress is strong. You can see that from the added pricing on Kingsford and in Burt's Bees, and we feel good about where we are. And it's also key reason why we remain confident that we'll grow gross margins in the back half; reminding everybody that much of the positive impact we'll see from pricing is going to materialize in the second half of the fiscal year. And as others perhaps are working through pricing increase discussions with retailers, as we speak, what we are able to do largely is to move on and talk to retailers about strong branding investments for the back half which will include, as we've mentioned, strong innovation plans. And certainly pricing helps us to continue to invest in the strategy that has yielded terrific returns for shareholders to-date and that we continue to have confidence in. So this will play out through the rest of the fiscal year. And out of the gate, we're strong and that's part of why we've been able to mitigate most of the incremental costs and negative currency impact that we've seen over the last quarter. So, so far so good. Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's great. And if I could just talk on one little follow-on question. Just as that pricing rolls out, I know that the time to order on most of your categories is very quick, relatively fast turns, but is there any lumpiness that we should be cognizant of throughout the fiscal year as you roll in this price? Any increased order in the first quarter, for example, to get ahead of future price increases? Or as we think about the pricing to come, any cadence of sale that maybe impacted by retailers getting ahead of planned pricing? Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, Steve. What I would expect to see, this will just build throughout the year, so I'd say sequentially better. You saw in Q1 we had about 90 basis points of gross margin accretion from pricing. Usually expect to see that continue to build through the year as we continue to roll out the pricing. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: And specifically on Q1, we have not commented on any forward buy playing a role here. If anything, we've seen a little headwind, perhaps 0.5 point or so, because we've been lapping a really strong hurricane-related sales in the last fiscal year. So this was a clean Q1. Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.: We'll take the next question. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. Hi, everyone. I wanted to circle back with a follow-on question on the changes that you're making to your share buybacks. I guess, in general, I'm wondering how you're now thinking about creating value for shareholders? And how this might have changed whether you're now looking for other ways to do this, such as pursuing possible M&A opportunities? If you could touch on your current thoughts on this, I think it would be helpful. Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Sure, Bonnie. I'm happy to answer that question. I'd say a couple things. First, obviously, we won't comment on future M&A. But as it relates to share buybacks, look, my priority is to make smart decisions for how we use the cash of our shareholders. If I was focused on EPS accretion as the primary objective, we would have done an ASR. And that's not what we're doing. And so as I mentioned, we've got clear criteria internally that directs our behaviors, and we'll continue to follow that. And I think as you've seen the progress we've made to-date, we're being very disciplined about this program. But again, EPS accretion is not my primarily objective here. It's making sure we make good, smart decisions of how we return our investors' cash. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then, if I may, just a couple quick questions on your advertising spend. I'm just wondering how quickly you expect it to ramp up, since you're guiding for a pretty decent chunk this fiscal year, the 10% as a percentage of sales, up from I guess 9.3% last year. And then given that your organic sales growth guidance in the year is pretty much in line with your performance last year, I mean could you guys talk a little bit about the lag I guess you're expecting in terms of trying to drive possibly faster top line growth from some of the stepped-up spend? Thanks. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, Bonnie. So as we commented in the past, so we're not making any comments as far as quarterly spend is concerned. We've always said that there's going to be a quarterly variation. What we have said is that our innovation plans this fiscal year are skewed towards the back half. So that should tell you something. But we maintain the guidance of about 10% for fiscal year. I'll also tell you that we don't measure the success of our advertising sales promotion in quarterly volume. These are strategic investments, long-term investments. And frankly, the bulk of the value in strategic advertising and sales promotion investments reach well past a 12 months' timeframe. So I'd be hard-pressed to compare a quarterly advertising sales promotional spend to quarterly sales, because it just doesn't necessarily work that way. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That is really helpful. Thank you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Thank you, Bonnie. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. I have a couple questions. First thing, which is on the Lifestyle business. If I've kind of backed into it correctly, it looks like Nutranext added about 19% to that division, which would suggest that you had volume up 16% and price mix of a negative 9%-ish. I'm just \u2013 those are some really, really big numbers. Lifestyle, I know can be a little bit choppy. There's periods you've had kind of high-single digit volume, but nothing like this. So anything in there with regard that's significant new distribution? Any kind of buy-in ahead of price increases? It's just the numbers are very, very large. I just would appreciate some greater information beyond what Lisah was able to share in the prepared remarks. Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Hi, Lauren. This is Kevin. Let me give you a couple thoughts and certainly welcome Benno to join as well. I'd say, obviously, overall Nutranext was the biggest contributor. And it's interesting when you look at our volume growth versus sales, and it's not necessarily intuitive, Nutranext has a lower revenue per case. So there's a bit of a negative mix on the top line. But it's margin accretive to the company. So that's something you'll see going forward. As Nutranext continues to grow, it'll be a hit to the sales versus volume, but it's certainly margin accretive for the company. So we feel great about the growth of Nutranext. And then maybe more broadly on the segment, I'm pleased to say we had low to mid-single digits growth across the entire portfolio. So every business grew. So good, strong performance in our Lifestyle segment this quarter. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: The low to mid-single digit growth on the rest of portfolio, that's a sales number or a volume number? Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Sales number, Lauren. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. On Nutranext, just thinking about relative to your other acquisition with RenewLife and some of the supply chain issues you've had there, anything you're doing differently with Nutranext to make sure with this very strong growth you don't kind of end up in the same situation you've been in with RenewLife, where you've now got to kind of build back up your shelf space, given the out of stock? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. That's a good question, Lauren, and good afternoon to you. So obviously that's something we're thinking about a lot. And the best thing I can say here is that the issue that we're facing on RenewLife really are not related in any way to Nutranext. So it's a separate business, it's a separate supply chain. But clearly what I would tell you is that the ordering patterns that we've seen on RenewLife and perhaps also the changes that we've made to our supply chain as part of the integration give us good learning. If anything, it's not learning that we necessarily like, but we take it knowing that RenewLife is a solid business with a lot of potential and momentum in the fastest-growing subsegment, which is e-commerce. But really two separate cases. And Nutranext, the integration is fully on track. We're seeing strong performance from the strategic brands that we bought, some growing double-digits and full speed ahead on Nutranext. And again, nothing that happens on RenewLife will have an impact on Nutranext in any way. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And I know it's been asked a few times, but I can't help but revisit Charcoal, right? So in the fourth quarter you cut advertising and merchandising support very, very significantly. One quarter later, a business that's historically strong that you have innovated against, that you have had news flow on is down double-digit. So can we just talk about why those two things aren't related? I mean you're sort of suggesting that there's something else going on. It's not because we cut. I mean, you had merchandising plans and you didn't follow through on them three months ago. So I want to just go back through that thought process and maybe I'm missing something, that the Charcoal category had been weakening for some time. I'd just love \u2013 a little bit more detail there would be great. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Thanks for clarifying. So I guess I'm less sure about your comment on we had merchandising plans, but didn't follow through on them. So as you know, retailers make merchandising decisions. But clearly, what we'd seen in the business initially earlier this year was weather-related. And our expectation was that the business would come back. And now it hasn't. And we're seeing that coincide with lower household penetration. I would be hard-pressed to associate that with one quarter advertising spending in particular, because again advertising spending works mostly in the long term. I would say that household penetration is down perhaps more as a result of the overall brand building execution that has worked for so many years, which was to extend the grilling season and essentially focusing on a set of households and extending their consumption throughout the year. We'll continue to do that because we continue to believe that there is a great value in that. But as an added focus, we will now turn our emphasis on adding households back. And much of our 2019 plans reflect that. What we have said last quarter is that most of the 2018 grilling season is essentially shocked, and that's what we're seeing now. So what we're seeing is not inconsistent with what we've commented on last quarter. But our focus is on the 2019 grilling season and making sure that we bring new consumers into the category. And based on the work that we're seeing to-date, which includes new graphics, new advertising, meaningful innovation and the right merchandising plans with retailers, which we're working on, we should be able to get this business back. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Good morning. Thanks very much. So I guess e-commerce is planned to be about 8% still, and it was 6% last year. So that kind of gives us the rate. But can you tell us if and where there is interaction with the brick-and-mortar business? And maybe comment on any particular areas of strength and weakness. And just one quick one on share repurchase. Just being very bluntly, , how do you think about the level of share price when you make the share repurchase calculation and as part of your plans, not just now, but all the time? Thanks. Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Hi, Jonathan. This is Kevin. I'll answer the share repurchase question and turn it over to Benno. And in all reality, I won't share our internal criteria. We have clear criteria we follow, but it's not something we'll share publicly. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thank you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. And then, I'll take the e-com question, Jonathan. So, obviously, feeling great about our progress in e-commerce. We have a lot of strong brands that work well in this channel. We're building strong capabilities. And importantly, as you know, the profitability also of the business is about in line with brick-and-mortar. So this is good. Clearly, there's interaction between e-com and brick-and-mortar, but the incrementality is significant. We expect it to be north of 50%. Share growth is faster than in brick-and-mortar on practically all of our businesses. So we feel like the primary source of incremental sales is that we're gaining share from other brands. The strength is really broad-based. There are certain businesses like Burt's Bees and Brita that have traditionally always done well because the consumer in those categories love to buy online. So we're seeing continued strength there. More recently, we're seeing strength from businesses like Cat Litter because it's certainly easier to order what are relatively heavy packs online, than to carry those packs home. And there's also a certain rhythm to the purchase of litter and trash bags for that matter, which makes these products really very suitable to subscription-based models. But our strongest business, frankly, is probably our Professional business, where as a percentage of total sales e-com accounts for around 20% because a lot of the purchases that many institutional and professionals buyers make are now done online. So broad-based strength, a lot of room left, which is why we said that we're pretty confident that this business can meet and perhaps even exceed our original stretch target of $500 million in sales by 2020. And we expect significant portion of those incremental sales from north of $300 million last fiscal year to continue to be incremental. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. So I too have a couple questions. One is on working capital. It was up a lot from 1.5% of sales to 3.2% I guess in your supplemental here as a percent of sales. Is that Nutranext? Are you in any way extending terms from payments perspective or inventory loading? Can you just identify why that went up so much? Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Hi, Ali. Sure, I can take that one. And you're right, it's primarily Nutranext. They have a much higher working capital as a percent of sales rate. And certainly that's an opportunity for us as we begin to integrate that business. But that was the primary driver of the increase of working capital for the company. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. I want to go back to repurchase a little bit and the curtailing of it. There are typically two reasons why that happens. One is, your math suggests that it's expensive to buy the stock right now or your idea is that you want to save money from an M&A perspective to go make bigger acquisition. I just want to make sure I'm understanding correctly that's more the former than the latter? Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Ali, as I've said, I obviously won't comment on future M&A. And as I also said we had very clear criteria. If you look back at our history, this is only the fourth open market share repurchase program we'd executed in the last two decades. And I think if you look at our previous results, we've been very disciplined in the way we execute those programs, and that's no exception for this program. We will continue to execute that discipline. As I mentioned, when you look at our results for about 9% of our authorization, I feel very good about the choices we're making for our shareholders. And we'll continue to do that going forward. But I'm not going to (00:51:31) about this. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So what do you mean by discipline? Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Well, what I'd say, Ali, is obviously I'm investing my shareholders' cash and I'll be very thoughtful about how I do that. And I'm hopeful you can appreciate and understand what that means. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: That is clear. Last question is on pricing and a topic we talk about often in terms of the elasticity. Look, it's tough to tease it out and I understand if there's difficult compares here. But it doesn't look great that the volumes decelerate or even went negative in the segments where you took pricing. So looks like the elasticity are getting a little bit worse. If you could kind of dissuade me from that point of view that'd be helpful? And aligned with that, historically, if you just look in terms of how much pricing you've taken relative to the commodity plus manufacturing and logistics costs, it's been about kind of 50% of an offset last year. And this year, it's much lower than that, kind of 18%-20% range. As you plan going forward, what percentage do you think you'll be able to offset in your gross margin through pricing? Is it back up to this 50% level? Thanks a lot. Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Maybe, Ali, I'll start with that question on gross margin impact to pricing and then I can turn over to Benno. If you look at our Q1 results and as you saw, we generate about 90 bps of benefit in the quarter from pricing; and that reflects fairly limited impacts from our initial pricing activity. Only litter is really in place for the entire quarter. And so, as we continue to progress through the year and continue to execute our pricing actions, I would expect you'll start seeing a benefit 2x what you saw in the first quarter flowing through in the back half of the year. And so, when you start looking at that size benefit from pricing, plus the ongoing benefits of cost savings which tend to be 150 bps or so, you really I think can start to see in the back half of the year why we believe we'll be in a position to start rebuilding margins. Maybe to that point, while you saw that we took our outlook down as it relates to gross margin for the year to about flat, I would tell you I'm personally much less concerned about the average for the year and much more focused on are we taking the right actions to put ourselves in a position to start rebuilding margins in the back of the year. And everything I'm seeing in terms of the progress on pricing and cost savings, I feel like we've positioned ourselves well to do that and it's really because we started executing pricing early. So I mean I've provided that perspective. And, Benno, if you want to talk about volume? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Hi, Ali. Maybe just a few things to add. Obviously, we've always commented that temporarily there's going to be a negative volume impact from pricing as people adjust to new price points. That's something that we build in our estimates, that's something that we communicated previously, and that's largely playing out as planned. And then, after about 12 months, in particular once all the competitive reactions are through, that normalizes. What I will tell you though that, again, it is not true that in the businesses that we've taken pricing, volume declines. Litter volume is up. Clorox toilet volume is up double-digits. Our premium trash bag, OdorShield, which as you know we care about a lot, volume is up. So just for the record, we grew volume 5%. International, the volume is up. So I just want to make sure that we have the right data and the right expectations here. Feeling good about pricing, I want to reiterate that. But, importantly, feel good about the top line momentum that we have maintained in the face of pricing, which frankly if I compare it to our own models on those businesses that are out of the gate early, it's frankly slightly better than planned. And that's been very important as it has helped us to mitigate the additional cost increases that we've been seeing. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks. So clarifying, volume perhaps decelerating because there'll be some reaction from a pricing perspective but still tough? Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Ali, maybe I would also add, a lot of times I hear folks talk about price mix, which I really think is only half the equation. When we take pricing, you should expect two impacts. One, we generate more revenue per case. The other one is because of the elasticity, there's a temporary pullback in volume as consumers adjust to the new pricing. We have a long history of taking pricing. And typically when we do that, we expect it to be fairly benign to the top line. And we're really doing it because it's helping offset the cost headwinds we're facing and improving gross profit. That's exactly how this is playing out, very much as we expected; that the offset of those two issues has very little impact on the top line, but it's clearly contributing, helping us offset our cost environment. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Steve Strycula of UBS. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, good afternoon. Benno, quick question as the world moves more online. How do we think about the percentage of your transactions that are done online are single incidence purchases versus building towards more of a subscription or annuity-like model? And then, I have a follow-up. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Steve, good question. I think that varies by business. There are certain businesses where there's less of a cadence, where it's more one-off purchases. And disinfecting wipes may be a good example where the majority of the purchases are single transactions, and then there are other businesses where we're seeing more of a natural rhythm. And I mentioned Cat Litter earlier, but certainly also vitamins and minerals and supplements business and Brita, where subscription-based models are very attractive. At this point, most of our sales are single transactions. But, clearly, we're interested in subscriptions; and in a number of businesses, we're seeing those increase. I cannot tell you where this is going; I don't think anybody can. But what I can tell you is that if and as this becomes a more important part of the e-com business, we're positioning ourselves to be a company that will benefit from it. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then, a follow-up maybe for Lisah, I suppose. What would the volume be on organic basis for the total company and for the Household or the Lifestyle division, excluding M&A? Thanks. Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.: You're asking Lifestyle or total company? So I think, Kevin in his earlier commentary made a comment that excluding Nutranext, Lifestyle would have grown in the high-single digits in volume. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Yeah, in the total company, if you have it. Thank you. Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.: For total company, we report on our sales. So we are not commenting on volume. But if you do the math, organic volume on a total company basis still grew. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good afternoon, folks, and happy Halloween. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Hi, Jason. Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Hey, Jason. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: A quick question for you on just the gross margin walk, the logistics in manufacturing leakage was a lot bigger than we were expecting, certainly bigger than we saw last year. And actually looking back over a decade of history, the biggest we've seen in 10 years. Can you unpack that for us? Let us understand what the drivers are and what your expectations are going forward for that line item? Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Sure, Jason, I can provide a little perspective on margin. I would say, generally gross margin came in about where we expected. If you recall back in August my comments, the expectation was this would be our most difficult comp, we've seen our gross margin under pressure for about six quarters now, with the exception of Q1 last year, which it actually grew about 50 bps. And so, we knew this would be a tough comp. Also keep in mind, last year, we really started to see the run-up in both commodity and transportation costs, really November, December. So we knew first four, five months of the year would be more difficult. There's a couple of areas where I'd say it came in a little higher than anticipated, there are really two. The first is, we are seeing some wage inflation higher than we anticipated. That'll play out through the year, although that's not too material. The other one though was more of a choice we made. We did make some different set of choices around transportation, and that had about a 20 to 30 bp hit in Q1. And if you think about our transportation environment, we move product one of two ways, either by rail, which tends to be a bit slower and cheaper; or we move it by truck, that tends to be faster, but more expensive. And because of some of the strength we saw in Q1, particularly on litter and Home Care, business was a bit stronger than we anticipated. We had to make a different decision to move some of that product from rail to truck to expedite its moves to make sure we could keep up with demand, and that added a little bit of headwinds to the first quarter. I don't worry too much about that. We can adjust inventory levels to ensure that doesn't happen going forward. And so, that was sort of how I think about Q1. And then, my expectation is, as we go forward, we will continue to see sequential improvement in gross margin. And I still believe we're on track to start expanding gross margins in the back half of the year. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's helpful, thanks. And my second and last question, and I'll pass it on, it comes back to penetration. Benno, you've touted your success on penetration for the last couple of years. And clearly it's emerged as a bit of a headwind in Kingsford. But as we're looking at the penetration data from the panel databases at Nielsen, it looks like it's become a bit more widespread. In fact, looking just at your top seven brands, penetration has begun to wane from the 2016 or 2015 peak, with most of that weakness starting to mount this year. Can you give us any \u2013 well, first, is that consistent, inconsistent with what you see in your own databases? And if consistent, can you give us any context to what's driving that? And whether or not we should be alarmed that maybe this is an early indicator of what's to come, like we saw in Kingsford? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: No, you should not be alarmed, Jason. The majority of our brands continues to have either stable or growing household penetration. 15 out of 22 brands are stable or growing. And we're able to measure also what will happen post price increases, and we're pretty confident in our ability to continue to drive household penetration in an effective way. The best way, of course, for us to do that is to continue to invest in our brands. And what we've commented on is our commitment to invest at the about 10% of sales level this fiscal year. And the second key strategy, of course, is innovation. And we have commented on the fact that we have a lot of very meaningful innovation coming out in our brands in the back half of the fiscal year in practically all of our major businesses. So, no, household penetration at Clorox remains strong and alive and we're committed to it. And we're also transparent enough to declare when one business perhaps is falling off a cliff a little bit and what that allows us to do, as you will hopefully have noted is to address it and address it aggressively and address it quickly. And then hold ourselves accountable to making improvements again so that Kingsford can join the large number of brands in our stable that have solid household penetration results back again in the next year. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, thank you, and hello, everyone. So I have a follow-up on pricing and competitive dynamics. Benno, you spoke about pricing by some of your competitors, but I'm assuming that is mostly the branded ones. Can you also talk about private label and how you're seeing the price gaps of your brands against private label, if they haven't widened too much or because you've done selective price packs? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, too early to say, Andrea. I think at the end of next quarter, we'll have a better view on what private label will do. So clearly right now, out of the gate, I'd perhaps mention bleach as one example, liquid bleach, where private label has not followed, but we're growing market share. So that perhaps should tell you that we have modeled pricing the right way. We have not assumed in our fiscal year guidance in our modeling for all competitors, including private label, to follow at all times. And what we're seeing right now in terms of competitive reaction even early out of the gate is about in line with what we had expected. So I think we just need to continue to play this out. The one additional comment I'd make is, have we dealt back? No, we have actually not dealt back at all. And I think we've commented in the past and we'll continue to take the position that it is not our intention to deal back. We'll certainly stay agile and monitor what's happening in the marketplace. But as an piece of evidence on how serious we are about not dealing back is that in Q1 of fiscal year 2019, our trade spend actually was lower than in Q1 of fiscal year 2018, as we've continued to be able to optimize how we spend. So no intention to deal back. And pricing, including price gaps, are performing about in line with our plans. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And on Lifestyle, just a follow-up, we're trying to do the math just discussed by Kevin. So if you do the clarification that you had, is the organic growth there was high-single digits, right? And then, earlier I believe the commentary was the organic business in Lifestyles were up low-single digits to mid-single digit, which implied the pricing was down. So was that primarily on Brita? Or there are some price reductions on Burt's Bees ahead of the list prices? I'm just trying to reconcile that comment. Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.: Hey, Andrea. Linking back to Benno's comment, price mix, to you guys' definition, is positive across all segments. All four segments have some positive price mix. Now in Lifestyle, I hope it's clear, but we said volume excluding Nutranext, or organic volume, is high-single digits, pretty strong. And sales would have been in the mid-single digits without Nutranext. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. Good afternoon, everyone. Benno, I was hoping you can talk about, there's always been this debate on leading brands, private label, tertiary brands. And it just seems like now with availability of big data and AI and the like, retailers are realizing that certain brands should have more space and maybe some of those third, fourth, fifth tier brands should have less space or not be on the shelf at all. And I know that's been an ongoing thing. But it looks like it's starting to accelerate. So I was hoping you can provide a little bit of context, especially in the context of private label and how much rhetoric is coming out of the retail community regarding private label? Thank you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Thanks, Nik. So we look at what's going on at retail and especially who's going at retail as a significant potential tailwind for our company. If you think about who is growing, they're limited assortment channels, right? So whether that's club or smaller stores, that Walmart's drive-in or drug, et cetera, dollar, what these stores are trying to accomplish is offer a wide assortment, meaning all categories. But less and less they will offer number three, four, five brands, right? So they will lean into market leaders, which they need for sales growth and to get people into the store, and they need private label. And then number three, four, five brands are squeezed out. And given that our portfolio is more than 80% in number one and two share brand, we believe that we can significantly benefit from that in the future. And we also believe that we are significantly benefiting from that today. And the evidence of that, of course, is the strength of our business in non-tracked channels. Many of the stores that you talk about, which lean on market leaders and private label are in non-tracked channels. And our growth in those channels continues to significantly outpace that of tracked channels. So tailwind for us. It's happening as we speak. But as consumers vote with their money to spend more and more money in non-tracked channels, we believe that it continues to be a tailwind for us. And it's certainly more efficient for retailers. And typically where retailers consolidate to market leaders and private label, that works well for their top line and for their bottom line. And as you know that we're category captains in most of the categories that we're in and with most retailers that we're in. And as we work with retailers on making assortment recommendations, we're certainly making sure that they have the same understanding of the data and the potential for the sales and profits that this polarization in the marketplace offers to them. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. And if I could just ask a quick question on M&A, you could just remind us all on kind of your focus right now in M&A, your priorities, and what the valuation landscape looks like right now. It seems to be a little bit more favorable today than maybe it was a year or two years ago? Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Thanks Nik for the question. On M&A, nothing's really changed. We continue to have strategic spaces that we've identified that we continue to look for opportunities. As you can imagine, I won't necessarily comment on anything specific, but nothing's really changed in terms of our openness to M&A. But as we've said many times, we feel very good about the portfolio we have, the strength of our base business. And if the right deal comes along at the right price, we're certainly open, but don't feel any pressure to have to deal. And I'd say nothing has changed in that regard. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Olivia Tong of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. Want to talk about price. And when you consider where to price and by how much, obviously raw materials is a big factor in that, but I'd be curious on how you get to a price increase plan. Specifically, I'm thinking about Charcoal because you mentioned about a third of the pricing is now in place, your approach in Charcoal to go. But how do you go about doing this and how do you think about relative success in a category where your business has been down a lot? Thanks. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah Olivia, good afternoon. You were breaking up a little bit, but I think if I understood your question correctly, is sort of our general approach to pricing and criteria that go into this, is that correct? Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That's correct. And then, just in terms of Charcoal, how you went about deciding on your price increase in Charcoal, given the challenges that you've seen in the business? Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, yeah. Thank you for that. So on pricing, clearly costs play a significant role, and this is a good opportunity. As a reminder that it's not the short-term costs, but it is midterm cost plateaus that we priced towards, which means that you can't always price toward short-term peaks. But the considerations while cost is the most important one that go into pricing decisions are the competitive environment, the strength of our innovation plans, is the value that we offer as expressed in the consumer value measure and, as a result, also the price sensitivity analytics that we have for every single brand. And then, we develop various scenarios and we pick the scenario that optimizes long-term business health and our ability to stem these short-term headwinds. Certainly, our intention to understand certain price points is important too as we make pricing decisions, but mostly driven by a solid cost-justified business case. That protects our ability to invest in the business, because as you all know well and Charcoal follows the same rhythm. Obviously, we have a lot of confidence in the Charcoal business long-term and in our 2019 plans and the price increase that we're taking now, which is going to be effective in December of this calendar year, allows us to make the strong investments that we need to turn this business around. And it's also a reflection of the strong value that consumers see in Charcoal. So pretty strategic approach to pricing, knowing that doing nothing at this point is not an option, we price as a way to help us continue to make strategic and long-term investments to create shareholder value, investments in innovation, investments in brand building plans that engage consumers, and investments in the growth in all channels with retailers. And the good news is that on most of our businesses, we're through pricing discussions and we're now back in the business of discussing how we can grow retailer categories and how we can maximize the impact of our innovation in the back half. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. That's helpful. And then, if I can just follow-up on a prior question around trucking logistics. Obviously, that number was a fair bit higher than we had anticipated. And you had mentioned two different things with that, wage inflation which sounds like it's clearly not just a one-quarter phenomenon; and then, the choice to move to truck rather than rail to keep up with demand. I would imagine that that is more of a shorter-term thing. So as we think about modeling for the remainder of the year, how do you think about trucking logistics? I would imagine that it goes down a little bit from that high watermark that you saw in Q1, but still pretty elevated as the year progresses? Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Yeah, Olivia. Thanks for the question. I would say that's the right way to think about it. Obviously, as I mentioned, the most difficult comps are probably the first four or five months of the year where you see outsized increases year-over-year. And then, as we start lapping that comp, you'll start to see a lower increase. If I just step back and think about the transportation market, last year we saw rate increases of roughly 15% to 20%. This year, back in August, I had identified our expectation were rate increases closer to 5% to 10%. I would tell you that's about where it seems to be playing out, still early in the year, but still an inflationary market, but to a lower degree. So as we progress through the year, I would expect to see logistics being a smaller impact year-over-year as we go. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thank you. Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.: Sure. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Thank you, Olivia. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would now like to turn the conference back to you. Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.: Yeah. Thank you all again for joining us today. And I look forward to speaking with you in February when we share our second quarter results. So Happy Halloween, everyone. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to The Clorox Company Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Release Conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. Lisah Burhan : Thanks, Sharon and welcome, everyone. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, our Chairman and CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our Web site, thecloroxcompany.com. On today's call, we'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliations with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available on our Web site, as well as in our SEC filings. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release. Please also recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. I would direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the tax legislation. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcome to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. I'll start by covering our Q2 top line performance discussing highlights in each one of our segments. Kevin will then address our financial results and outlook. Finally, we'll turn over to Benno to offer his perspective and then close with Q&A. For the total company, Q2 sales grew 4%, reflecting about 3 points of unfavorable foreign currency impact due mainly to the devaluation of the Argentine peso and about four points of benefit from the Nutranext acquisition. I will now go through our result by segment. In our cleaning segment, Q2 sales grew 6% behind strong results in all three business units. Cleaning segment sales growth was once again lead by homecare, benefiting from strong innovation across the portfolio, including the new products on Clorox Scentiva platform. We recently launched Clorox Scentiva disinfecting wet muffing cloths marking the entry of the Scentiva platform into this category. That will be the first branded muffing cloth to provide disinfecting benefits along with the Clorox cleaning efficacy and Scentiva sensorial experience consumers have come to love. Homecare is also a business where we have taken pricing across a substantial part of the portfolio. Pricing actions are progressing according to plan with market shares growing in key categories where we had increased prices last quarter. We continue to support this business with meaningful investments in advertising and sales promotion, with strong ROIs that have doubled since 2016, driven by the scale and quality of our digital marketing. Our laundry business also grew sales strongly in the quarter with higher shipments of Clorox liquid bleach. Just as in homecare, implementation of price increases is going well. While competition has not followed our pricing actions as anticipated, total liquid bleach share was up nearly 1 point in the last 13 weeks in tracked channels. This is only possible because we invest strongly in our brands and the benefit of our recent price increase will allow us to continue doing so and drive long-term category health. Lastly, within the cleaning segment, our professional products business grew sales, supported by broad-based double-digit volume growth. We continue to bring Clorox strength and innovation and brand building into this space and recently re-launched our offering as Clorox pro, a new mega brand encompassing both the business industry different healthcare products and commercial cleaning products, positioning it for continued momentum and to drive scale. Turning to the household segment. Q2 sales decreased 4%, reflecting the clients in glad, Charcoal and RenewLife, partially offset by gains in Cat Litter. Charcoal sales decreased in the second quarter, primarily due to a shift in the timing of shipments from Q2 to Q3 in support of an early season customer program, as well as continued lower consumption. As a remainder, Q2 is a relatively small quarter for this business, representing less than 10% of annual shipments. Our focus now is on implementing the aggressive plans we introduced in last quarter for the 2019 grilling season. Those plans, which are well underway into stepping up our brand building programs to reenergize existing consumers, as well as bring new consumers into the category. We\u2019re also making significant packaging upgrades that include new sizes and strong claims. On the innovation front, we will be launching 100% hardwood briquettes to address some consumers' preferences for different grilling methods. And will be focused on partnering with our retailers to aggressively merchandize Kingsford, including extending the grilling seasons, which has worked so well in driving of the growth for so many years. In conjunction with these plans, we begin rolling out a cost justified price increase in December. We remain confident that these steps will help raise the overall value for the category, allowing us to reinvest in brand building, including innovation that will maintain the superior value of the Kingsford brand. In Glad bags and wraps, sales declined mainly as a result of lower shipments of food storage products, as well as lower shipments of trash bags due to an increased price gap compared to our competitors who did not follow our recent price increase. As you know, we're deeply committed to deliver in superior consumer value. Our back half plans include promotional activities aimed at defending our share position. Longer-term, we're confident that we can drive profitable growth in this business, as we have a successful track record of trading consumers up to our premium patent and trademark protected innovations, which remain our strongest competitive advantage. Our latest initiatives include leveraging our intellectual property, such as lip guard and ForceFlex Plus to support stronger claims and developing more effective advertising. In RenewLife, sales were down driven mainly by an overall category decline. That said, we continue to make progress in this business as we saw share growth in Q2 with largest national retailer in the Natural Channel for this first time in two years, any e-commerce the fastest growing channel where we had double-digit volume growth in Q2. We're also encouraged by early results of our initiatives to at scale by co-merchandizing Nutranext with RenewLife brands, which has already began to yield a significant lift in sales during merchandizing events. With our plans to continue leaning into e-commerce and innovation, as well as re-launch packaging featuring stronger claims, we'll keep driving this business and rebuilding momentum. A continued bright spot within household segment, our Cat Litter business had another strong quarter of double-digit sales growth supported by Fresh Step Clean Paws innovation, strong e-commerce growth and the benefit of price increases, which are now also reflected in all major competitive products. With additional Clean Paws innovation being introduced in the back half of the fiscal year, including unscented and a Mediterranean lavender scent, we're confident about the growth trajectory of this business. In our Lifestyle segment, we grew sales in every single business. Segment sales grew 25% in Q2, mainly reflecting the Nutranext acquisition, which added about 21 points of benefit. Integration is going well with our flagship brands recently gaining national distribution at several major retailers, reflecting the difference that our customer capabilities are starting to make. We're also turning on the innovation machine, fee wheeling growth with this business with a steady stream of new products in the back half. The Burt's Bees business saw strong sales growth with another quarter of double-digit shipments in lip care behind strong consumption, as well as innovation such as Burt's Bees conditioning lip scrub and Burt's Bees over night lip mask and continued strength in face care. This is in line with our strategy to drive profitable growth through a focus on our core segments. We told you last quarter. We're taking a cost specified price increase in the portion of the Burt's Bees portfolio effective this month. Selling is generally on track with our expectation with new pricing expected to be in effect at major retailers starting today. Food sales grew strongly in Q2, mainly behind shipments of hidden valley ranch dry dressings despite price increases implemented last quarter. We are continuing to build on the Hidden Valley ranch equity, which grew share for a 16th consecutive quarter. One of the ways we are doing that is through innovation that is on trend, capitalizing on consumer interest in Hidden Valley for uses other than salad dressing. In fact, over two thirds of bottle occasions are for these alternative uses, as tipping sauce, topping or spread. Now based on this insight, we will be introducing a ready to eat dip in the back half, supported by strong brand building investments. With this product, we are looking to play in the new segment with stronger tailwinds compared to the dressing category. Finally, within the lifestyle segment, Brita had its third consecutive quarter of solid sales growth with the stream pitcher and filter innovations continuing to perform well and our market share is starting to improve. We are optimistic about building on that success in the back of the fiscal year. We've recently introduced our new Brita premium filtering water bottles, which are now available in e-commerce channels. While it's early, we are excited to see that they are already generating great reviews. Finally, turning to our international segment. Sales decreased 8% as the benefit of price increases was more than offset by about 16 points of unfavorable foreign currency impact. Strong Go Lean strategy executions, including pricing and cost savings initiatives, provided a significant offset to the considerable FX headwinds. In particular, our Burt's Bees international business had a strong quarter with double digits volume growth and strong performance generally across the board. Now, I'll turn it over to Kevin who will discuss our second quarter financial performance and outlook for FY'19. Kevin Jacobsen : Thank you, Lisah and thank you everyone for joining us today. We are pleased to deliver another quarter of strong sales growth and return to gross margin expansion. Importantly, we remain on track to deliver our fiscal year 2019 outlook. I will address that in a moment. Turning to our financial results for the second quarter. Sales grew 4%, which included 4 points of benefit from Nutranext acquisition, partially offset by 3 point of negative impact from foreign currencies. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 43.7%, an increase of 70 basis point compared to 43% in year ago quarter. Second quarter gross margin included the benefits of 220 basis points from pricing and 140 basis points from cost savings, partially offset by 190 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs and 120 basis points of unfavorable commodity costs. I would like to note that a little more than half of the expansion in our second quarter gross margin was driven by a shift in spending in our supply chain, which we expect to reverse out in the second half of the fiscal year. Selling, administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 14.3% versus 13.9% in the year ago quarter, reflecting Nutranext integration expenses. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at about 10%. We are spending for U.S. retail business at a healthy 11%. Our second quarter effective tax rate came in at about 19% versus about minus 3% in the year ago quarter when we benefited from a significant one-time reduction in our tax rate as a result of U.S. tax reform. Net of all these factors in our second quarter, we delivered diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.40 versus a $1.77 in the year ago quarter, a 21% decrease due to lapping a one-time $0.40 benefit from U.S. tax reform in the year ago quarter. Turning to year-to-date cash flow. As we noted in our press release, net cash provided by continuing operations increased 39% to $449 million, primarily from lower tax payments as a result of U.S. tax reform. Turning to our full fiscal year, we are pleased to confirm our sales and earnings outlook. Our fiscal year sales outlook continues to be in the range of 2% to 4%, now reflecting about 3 points of negative impact from unfavorable currencies. As I mentioned last quarter, we anticipated more pronounced currency headwinds, primarily from the devaluation of the Argentine peso. Our sales outlook also now includes about three points of net benefit from the Nutranext acquisition, which is running slightly ahead of plan and the Aplicare divestiture. And as we mentioned in our press release, our fiscal sales outlook continues to assume about 3 points of incremental sales from our innovation program. We have a robust pipeline of new products in the second half of the fiscal year, which we plan to support with strong demand building investments to drive awareness and trial. Turning to fiscal year gross margin, we continue to expect fiscal year gross margin to be about flat as the benefits of pricing and cost savings are expected to be offset by increased cost and currency pressures. We remain on track to deliver gross margin expansion in the second half of the fiscal year, although at a more muted rate given the shift in supply-chain spending to the back half. Other assumptions that are unchanged in our fiscal year 2019 outlook, include fiscal year advertising and sales promotion spending at about 10% of sales, selling and administrative expenses at about 14% of sales and EBIT margin to be down, reflecting our expectations for flat gross margin, as well as our plans to complete the Nutranext integration and invest strongly in advertising to support our strong back half innovation plans. And finally, free cash flow of about 11 to 13% of sales. As we mentioned in our press release, our assumptions for our fiscal year tax rate did change and is now expected to be in the range of 22% to 23%. Net of all these factors, we continue to expect fiscal year diluted EPS to be in the range of 6.20 to 6.40, reflecting our estimate of $0.08 to $0.12 of EPS dilution from the Nutranext acquisition in addition to $0.05 to $0.07 of negative impact from tariffs, which are affecting a couple of our business units. In closing, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance and our overall first half results. Strong execution of our strategic plans from pricing to agile initiatives is helping us address continued cost and foreign exchange pressures. With our pricing actions largely behind us consistent with our 2020 strategy we can now shift our focus to investing in demand creation, including our strong innovation programs to sustain our core business and deliver long-term shareholder value. And with that, I'll turn over Benno. Benno Dorer : Thanks Kevin, and thanks everyone for being on the call. Let me share my three key messages for you today. First, I\u2019m pleased with our first half results with the second quarter delivering strong sales growth and a return to gross margin expansion. Our sales increase to 4% is especially strong considering we absorbed about 3 points of unfavorable foreign currencies, primarily from the devaluation of the Argentine peso in the last fiscal year. Clorox continues to sustain top line momentum, demonstrating our ongoing ability to win with consumers. We are differentiating our products and brands through innovation, investing strongly in ROI based marketing communications and leveraging our strength in e-commerce, which we continue to expect to grow strongly and be about 8% of company sales for fiscal year. The Nutranex acquisition also contributed strongly to total company sales and continues to be accretive to the company's gross margin. Integration remains on track and we're pleased about expanded national distribution at several major retailers. I\u2019m also very pleased that we expanded gross margin in the second quarter as rebuilding our margins is an ongoing priority and our focus on good growth, growth that is profitable, sustainable and responsible. My second point is that Clorox continues to execute strongly against our strategic priorities. As you know, Clorox leaned into pricing early to address increased cost pressures. As Kevin noted, we have now completed most of our pricing actions, which have been executed with excellence and with our pricing actions mostly behind us, we can focus on growing our categories and brands that are long-term. We will invest strongly in marketing communications to maximize innovation platforms and drive awareness and trial of new products across our portfolio in the second half of the fiscal year. Importantly, last quarter I said we would leave no stone unturned in our focus to rebuild margin and we did deliver. Clorox people stepped up to drive margin accretive innovation, execute our pricing plans and lean into our agile initiatives for cost savings. Finally, my last point is that we remain confident in having the right strategy to drive long-term shareholder value. Our 2020 strategy has been the bedrock of our focus on long-term profitable growth. Clorox has continued to deliver strong growth and shareholder returns in an environment where growth is hard to come by because of our relentless emphasis on strategic clarity supported by agile decision-making and strong execution. And while we are still closing out the current strategy, we also have our sight set on the future. As we finalize the successor to our 2020 strategy, I can tell you we will continue to lean into critical areas. First, serving our consumers and delivering superior value will continue to underpin everything we do. Innovation continues to be our lifeblood and sets us apart. We will continue to lean more deeply into our proven innovation capabilities to win in the marketplace, particularly in a dynamic omni-channel retail environments. Second, transforming how we work to be an even more agile, decisive organization that executes with excellence and leverages technology to drive competitive advantage will be critical to supporting a culture focus on growth. And finally, as a mission driven business, we will continue to focus on good growth, creating long-term value for all our stakeholders by living our values and ensuring corporate responsibility is embedded in our business. We look forward to introducing our updated strategy to you in early October. to you in early October.  Thank you. Operator you may now open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : So I guess just to start. Obviously, you had a strong quarter and there's the lower tax rate in the full year guide. And I get that there's were seeing effects, but you've also got strong pricing and incremental contributions from Nutranext. So, I guess just within the outlook. What's the negative offset in the back half that's not allowing a full-year guidance raise at least at the low-end? And I guess within that, is it the increased promotion that you've called out today in household care that's disallowing that upside from flown through? Kevin Jacobsen : What I would say, as you mentioned, tax rates a little bit better. I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that. I'd view that more as a minor tune-up. At the end of last quarter, I anticipated we'd be slightly above 23%. I think we'll now be below 23%. So I've tightened up that range. And then I'll say that as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we do think the FX environment is a little bit worse, particularly in Argentina. And so I think within our range, those are both fairly offsetting and it allows us to maintain our outlook for the year. Steve Powers : And I guess just given the -- I mean, I think the topic that's on a lot of folks' minds, just given the oil prices as a benchmark, for example, are back to where they were in the fall of '17 when the inflation headwinds that are just defining current price increases started. Is there a concern that what you're seeing in household care is specifically in bags and wraps with competitors not following. But we're seeing it a little bit in charcoal and other places as well. Is that a bellwether for other categories that you may have to promote back some of this recent price increases going forward more broadly? How does that factor into your thinking? Kevin Jacobsen : As it relates to commodities and specifically oil, I would say for us because we primarily source resin from the U.S., it's much more driven by supply and demand and driven by nat gas than oil. And so I would say as we talk maybe broadly about pricing, as both Ben and I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we feel very good in aggregate about our ability to execute pricing and how it's playing out in the marketplace. The one exception that I would say is on our bags and wraps business. And what I'd tell you is when we start our planning back in May, June, we had a certain expectation for the resin market. Sitting here today I would tell you, while resin is still going to be inflationary, we are seeing softening-up in international demand. And my expectation now is we will not see the same level of resin increase that we anticipated when we took the pricing. And so specific to the Glad business, I think we will spend some money back to defend share in the near-term on the Glad business specifically. But what I'd tell you is that's something we know how to do. We've done it quite often specifically on Glad. We used trade spending managed resin prices. I would say broadly everything else in commodity is playing out as we expected. And then I would say that's true for pricing, as well with the exception of Glad I think we will do some work there. Important to note though, because we will spend a little bit more money back on Glad, we're also seeing a slightly less commodity headwinds that will fund that. So we're no worse off as it relate to margin and profit, but something we will do in the back of the year. Steve Powers : I just wanted, maybe one quick clean up, just the inventory level exiting December, it is more elevated than we've seen in a while just measured in days. How much of that is you building inventory ahead of new product launches in the second half given the strong innovation pipeline versus maybe being less with excess inventory in some of those household categories. It didn\u2019t see as much sell through in December. Just trying to get underneath that inventory spike for lack of a better word? Benno Dorer : So if you look at our attachment, you can see our inventory levels, they were 53 days at the end of Q2 they are 59 days now. We're up a little bit. I would say the bulk of that is Nutranext. Keep in mind Q2 last year Nutranext not one of our portfolio. So that\u2019s the bulk of the increase in inventory. And then because we have such a strong innovation pipeline in the back half of this year, we did pre-build in preparation for launching in innovation, so that explains a bulk of the rest of it. Operator : Your next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : I just had a couple of questions on your Charcoal business. First, could you guys quantify the amount of the shift you saw in Charcoal, maybe from Q2 that you are expecting to move into Q3? And then did the change in timing of this shipments impact your gross margin in Q2? Or do you guys expect it to maybe impact gross margins in Q3? Kevin Jacobsen : Bonnie, what I would say is the bulk of the movement in Charcoal is based on just the timing of the shipment. Keep in mind shipping between December and January that moves all the time. We're shipping and preparation for early-season merchandising. So we anticipated going December, it actually is going to in January, but for the year that creates no impact to the results. And then the second question was beyond timing of shipments? Bonnie Herzog : Just trying to get a sense of how much of an impact that could be on gross margins just some of this timing in your shipments for that business? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, it won't have much impact on margin. Charcoal is pretty close to the company average. So I wouldn\u2019t expect to see much change in margin as it shifts between quarters. Bonnie Herzog : And then could you guys talk a little bit further about some of the innovation that you bring into the market place. Just in terms of what we're seeing with the slowdown in trends and how you expect some of this innovation to resonate better than maybe some of your existing product? Benno Dorer : Keep in mind that what you're seeing in tracked channels less and less reflects what we are seeing on a total business right. So I would take what you categorize as a slowdown with a grain of salt. But we are very excited about very strong innovation plan in the back half across all or most of our portfolio with notable innovations across the major brands. Lisah has mentioned a few of them, Scentiva as a platform in homecare. Our largest SBU continues to do extremely well. And we're launching a very differentiated product in the wet mopping cloth category that\u2019s a big category. And we will launch the first available product that combines the Clorox cleaning performance that people love with disinfecting, which is not available in this category today, but also the sensorial experience that Scentiva delivers and that\u2019s an innovation into a new space for our oldest brand that we are excited about. So we are excited about Glad where we are expanding the latest technologies platform, which is backed up by about 40 patents across the portfolio and that of course is very timely on Glad. We're launching 100% hardwood briquettes on charcoal. We're starting to launch innovation across Nutranext brands. And we will continue to expand the clean paws platform on litter. And then last but not least super excited about food where we're launching into ready to eat dips, that's a category that's almost $2 billion in size and about the same size as salad dressing, so we're essentially doubling the access of the Hidden Valley brand, which continues to do extremely well, 16 quarters of share growth. And you three quarters of all the uses that we see on the Hidden Valley today are outside salad dressings. People use it on pizza, use it on chicken wings, or with healthy snacks and veggies. And the ready to eat dips are great premium products that's going to make that easy and that we're very excited about, both in terms of customer reaction as well as early consumption in market. So we have long said that in the back half, we will return to investing strongly behind innovations, and that's why it was very important for us also to do pricing early. Because as Kevin noted, in particular it's now largely behind us and we have an organization that will now focus on growing our brands and growing categories for retailers and doing that behind a really strong set of innovations and aggressive spending. So feel good about where we are and that's a big part of why we're sitting here today and able to confirm our outlook both in terms of sales and earnings. Bonnie Herzog : And then just one clarification on timing. It seems like what you just discussed, a lot of it will be back half weighted. But I get the sense that Q3, there'll be a fair amount of stepped up advertising and certainly promo support, just in terms of trying to drive trials. So maybe a little bit more of a drag on Q3 than what you're expecting in Q4? Maybe first question and then second, I think you mentioned this but a huge opportunity for you guys could be with this innovation, is also for you to privatize or drive trade-up within some of your different categories? Benno Dorer : Maybe the last one first, Bonnie. Trade-ups hallmark of our company and we believe that consumers continue to be willing to reward us and pay for innovation that they see as value and the bulk of this innovation is in the premium segment, the bulk of this innovation also is margin accretive to us as a company, which is part of why we feel bullish about gross margin in the back half. So we continue to do a nice job to stay value focused, but capture value at the premium and through innovation. So that observation is certainly true. And then in terms of you know quarterly spend, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily conclude that. The reality is that because of retail of shelf set timings and also because of our increasing focus to drive these innovation platforms with an eye on the long-term and not just in one quarter. You will see a strong spend for us across the back half, across both quarters. And I'm not in a position right now to predict whether one quarter is stronger than the other, but you'll see healthy spend for Q3 and Q4. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jason English : A couple questions, first I'm trying to get a better understanding of the price contribution this quarter versus the last quarter. We can clearly do some math on back half volume to try to get to organic price mix. On that math it suggests that price mix was about 200 basis points in the first quarter and again in the second. But clearly, the flow through to gross margin stepped materially in the second quarter. Is it fair to assume that the reason for is that absolute price grew substantially from 1Q to 2Q, and that there was a healthy mix benefit in the first quarter that stayed in the second. So is that thought process reasonable? And second if so, what drove the spike in the mix benefit in the first quarter that fed in the second? Kevin Jacobsen : As it relates to price mix, here's what I'd tell you. We actually don\u2019t spend a lot of time talking by price mix, because I think that really only represents about half of the impact we take pricing. And so you take pricing, there is really two implications. One, you generate more revenue per case. But with elasticities in the near term as consumers adjust to the price, you expect to see some volume pull back. Our history has been and what we expect for this round of pricing is when you look at both of those issues together, there's very little impact to the top line from pricing. One essentially offset the other in the year you take pricing. And I would tell you us, that's pretty much how it's playing out through the first six months and frankly how I'd expect it to play out for the balance of the year. But as you know that's not why we're taking pricing. We're taking it because we\u2019re trying to address the cost and currency headwind that we have to face and allow us to continue investment in the brands. And so that's really the primary reason we\u2019re taking it. As it relates to the impact you\u2019re seeing, what I would say is you look at Q1, we got about 90 bps of gross margin accretion from pricing. And then this quarter, we got about 220. The reason why that improved is if you recall in Q1, really only Cat Litter was the only brand that had pricing in place for the entire quarter. We started taking additional pricing in August and September across the bulk of the portfolio, and that's really why you see the greater impact to margin in Q2. And then what I'd expect going forward keep in mind, we've taken a price increase in charcoal and a portion of Burt's Bees are not in these results. So I would expect some continued strength in the back half of the year from pricing as it relates to gross margin as you fully reflect the benefits of those two additional pricing actions. Jason English : So mix contribution to sales didn\u2019t change between the first and second quarter? Kevin Jacobsen : No, Jason. What I'd tell you is as it relates to pricing. Pricing is generating very little benefit to revenue. And we're really getting the benefits. If you look as an example in Q2, 4 points from Nutranext and 3 points of revenue growth from our base business primarily focused on innovation, that\u2019s really what's driving the top line, it's not pricing. Jason English : I will another question then. On the U.S. business in aggregate, organic sales decelerated from the first quarter despite a substantially easier comparison. I you we walked through a few puts and takes at the individual segment level. But high-level, can you give us some of the key drivers of what drove the deceleration, particularly to your stack basis? Kevin Jacobsen : I don\u2019t see that same data, Jason. Our base business grew about 3%, both Q1 and Q2. So I\u2019m not sure what you are looking at, but that\u2019s not the perspective we have on the performance of the business. Jason English : Okay, it was just -- it's from your part of results. But I will follow up with these offline. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Strycula of UBS. Steven Strycula : I was curious for the renewal life in charcoal business, sounds like you have some initiatives underway for the back half of the year. Do you think that those businesses can grow, particularly charcoal as you put through some pricing, get the shipment benefit and then you lap easy weather? That will be my first question, and then I have a follow up. Benno Dorer : First of all, today, no major news versus the November update that we gave, because our improvements are really focused on the 2019 calendar year grilling season. So Q2 is clearly is somewhat soft, Kevin explained it primarily due a shift in timing as is related to an early-season customer program. Keep in mind that Q2 is really small with less than 10% of fiscal year shipments. I would say that we would expect the rest of this fiscal year to be better clearly than Q2, albeit it's probably not all of the way to where we wanted to be. Pricing will help. Significant packaging upgrade will help. The 100% hardwood briquettes launch in the back half will help. Better retailer merchandising will help. And then there is the weather components, which I find hard to predict. But last year, clearly, wasn't a great year. But I would say that's plus pricing should enable us to do better for the rest of the fiscal year. And then my hope would be that as we think about the total 2019 calendar year relative to 2018 that we should see a market improvement on that business as a result of all of this activity that I was just describing. Steven Strycula : And then a follow-up question for Kevin to Steve Powers' question on inventories. On a year-over-year basis, you were up $85 million and the RenewLife business, my understanding is it's about $200 million business. So I'm just trying to understand that seems like a big contribution the year-over-year build of inventory. Is there anything else from an inventory shipment perspective that we should think about or finished goods that are ready to come into market in the third and fourth quarter for to support and innovation? Kevin Jacobsen : Steve, I'd say a few things. One, it is primarily Nutranext, as I've mentioned. And as you could imagine, it's a fairly new business that we've owned less than a year. There's some real opportunities for us to rationalize inventory, so that we see that as an opportunity going forward. And then also we do have some innovation coming on Nutranext. So there is some pre-build as well as we're preparing to launch some new products on that business. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Andrea Teixeira : So do you expect the household sales staying flat positively in the Q3? And I'm saying that because you called out some shelf space losses. So I'm wondering if you can reverse within this fiscal year with innovation and new displays. Or that's something that you're still going to be looking to use promotional dollars to reignite? Thank you. Kevin Jacobsen : I mean without providing specific outlook for quarters and segments, which as you know Andrea, we would not want to do. Kingsford, we certainly would hope that the quarter relative to year ago is going to be better and what we talked about for Glad, and those are really the two big businesses that impacted Q2 sales negatively and household in frankly an environment where now we're talking those two businesses. But I would note that the rest of the businesses of course did very, very well. But I'm Glad we're starting to spend back some of the pricing goodness and promotions, and we should see that at minimum stabilize and ideally start to improve the trends that we're seeing. Again, not unusual to see these trends in a year where you take pricing in particular when resin costs now go the other way, and we're not seeing competition follow. So that's noise in the market that we've seen before and that's noise that we've also managed before. But I would expect Q3 to see improvements on both businesses, yes. Operator : Next question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : I would like to come back to medical, gross margin commentary. So last quarter, the comment was you didn\u2019t expect to see improvement to the back half of the year and your comment was also some of this was timing and supply chain spending, which I think the comment was it drove half of it. The gross margins were still up in the quarter. So a little bit better seemingly than what you had planned. So if you could drill down a little bit on that? What was driving some of that? Is this just lower commodities? And then with respect to how this informs the view for year. It seems like maybe pricing trade spending a bit worse given the dynamic in Glad, commodities are bit better and then perhaps no change to manufacturing and logistics. Is that the right way to think about? I'm just trying to gauge the level of conservativism in the outlook, because it seems like the quarter certainly came in better than planned but yet, you are maintaining outlook. Kevin Jacobsen : I would not say it's conservative. I think this is a balanced view of where we see the year landing. What I would say and you heard in my prepared remarks, little more than half of our gross margin expansion in Q2 was timing. We had some investments planned for some very long lead cost savings projects that are probably 12 to 18 months out in the future. And is not atypical to see some of that spending ship between quarters, and so that money will get spend in the back half of the year. And because of that, I just think the shape of our gross margin expansion will be a bit more consistent Q2 through Q4 as some of that money ships to the back half of the year. But for the most part I would tell you the items that we are monitoring within margin are playing out about as we expected, transportation, manufacturing cost savings, et cetera. There is probably going to be a little bit more FX headwinds as we mentioned as we have talked about the pressure on the top line from FX being closer to 3 point and 2, that will have a little bit of a margin impact. I also mentioned I think the commodity environment will be a little bit more favorable than we anticipated, still a headwind but I do expect resin to lighten up a little bit in the back half. And so those are some of the items we are watching. But I guess bigger picture I would say the items that we can control, cost savings, pricing, admin, productivity, I would say all going very well and on track. But I do want be balance here. There is a lot of volatile items that are outside of our control, FX, commodities and currencies. So I think it\u2019s a prudent and balanced outlook at this point. Kevin Grundy : And then one follow-up just with respect to capital deployment, share repurchases in the commentary there and the impact on guidance received a lot of attention last quarter. Any update there? And then in terms of what's included in your guidance. And then Benno maybe you could tie in M&A. And you've been pretty clear about areas of interest, personal care, food enhancers and health and wellness in the past. What are you seeing in terms of pipeline at this point? And are you prepared to transact there, should the right deal come along? Kevin Jacobsen : I'll start with your question around cash return to shareholders. And maybe the perspective to be most helpful, I'll talk about our activities fiscal year-to-date. So halfway through the year, we've now returned about $500 million to shareholders, and that's been split almost equally between dividends and share repurchases. That's up about 75% versus the first six months of last year. And it's really driven by both the combination of, as you may recall, we took a 14% increase in the dividend last May that's certainly helping. And then we initiated our open market share repurchase program starting in May. Specific to Q2, I repurchased about $38 million for the shares in the second quarter and assigned that all to the dilution management program. And so as it relates to the open market share repurchase program, no new activity in the second quarter. I'm still at about 9% of my total authorization. And I would tell you plans for the balance of the year hasn't changed from when we talked last quarter and those are certainly included in the outlook. Benno Dorer : And then Kevin, your question on M&A. Obviously, we continue to generate a lot of cash. This was a very strong quarter in terms of cash flow, up 39%. And our business priorities overall continue to be the same. We continue to build our business from a core out, so maintaining and driving the strong core business continues to be our most important job. The second priority also continues to be to keep driving shareholder return with our vitamins, minerals and supplements business. We've got some work to do on RenewLife, but we certainly like the green shoots that Lisah was describing earlier. We also like that we're now able to drive scale, in particular with retailers around Nutranext, which is showing some very significant initial lift as we think about merchandising events. And Nutranext obviously is doing really well, so we're pleased with that. But we continue to look at a lot of things M&A wise with our board. We can continue to pursue the same priorities. And should the right opportunity come along, and that means good business at the right price, we're absolutely willing to pull the trigger. But in the meantime, I think we're seeing that we could do quite well for our shareholders with the businesses that we have. Operator : Next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : So, I'm a little confused about a few things that I'm hearing, would just love maybe to point through them for some clarification. So one is, I still have a tough time pinpointing why H2 is getting worse. I get the FX, I get Argentina. But it does seem like there's something that you're going to have to be investing in more. And I don't know if it\u2019s the supply chain investments, maybe that's what the answer, maybe magnitude of that. But it just feels like there's something else that's going on in terms of H2 that you're seeing perhaps you want to have some flex to invest in. I don't really understand 20%, 17%, 18%, inventory growth coming from business that's about 1% of your sale. I don't really get when you said earlier, Kevin, I think it was that top line isn't really being helped by pricing to Jason's question, which means elasticity is a negative one and you're doing it for gross margin. I am not sure how your retailers would feel about that. And then we still have the laundry business, 9% of sales and the Glad business 14% of sales, so about a quarter of your business not seeing the pricing come through like you thought. So I guess, I am sorry for the long lip, but I am just trying to figure out what's going on. And I'm just having trouble. Can you help on any of that? Kevin Jacobsen : It's a long list, let me take a shot at a few and see if we can answer some of your questions. So as it relates to inventory, as you see in our attachments, it's up about I think $84 million quarter-over-quarter. And as I said, a good portion of that is the Nutranext acquisition. And if you've been around small business when you acquired them, there's lots of opportunity to drive improvements and I'd say this is just one opportunity to significantly rationalize that business. And that include skew rationalization, which would certainly lead to improved inventory levels. So I view that as certainly an opportunity for us. And that was the bulk of the change in inventory. So that's the business we acquired. It gives me plenty of opportunity to go after improvements. And I think we can drive that over time. Another question you had us on the top line. Look, what I'd tell you, I'll step back and talk in aggregate versus anyone business. When we take pricing and as you know, Ali, we've taken a lot of pricing over the years. I don't expect much impact to the top line. When you net out price mix and volume at least in the near term that\u2019s first six to 12 months that has very little impact to the top line, but why we do that is because we have to recover the cost and currency headwind, because we want to keep investing in our business and to help grow categories. And so I think the retailers appreciate strong innovation that helps them grow their categories, that's the partnership we can offer. But to do that we have to cover the cost environment, and that's really why we're executing pricing. We are not executing pricing to drive the top line. Benno Dorer : And maybe two additions, Ali, so helpful to be able to clarify these for the inventories; so I think it\u2019s clear to everybody that most of our orders; and most of our inventories are managed electronically with our retailers; so this all flows through so there is nothing strange going on. I want to be very clear here on the inventories are than the things that Kevin expected. And as a company, we pride ourselves in being efficient. And obviously the economic profit matters to us a great deal as everybody knows. So we manage inventories tightly and we certainly expect to continue to do that on our entire business, including Nutranext And then perhaps just to close the loop on pricing. I want to be sure that we all understand that, Glad, our pricing was executed exactly in line with our expectations. So we see it full pass-through. But due to a change in the resin environments, we are now not seeing competition to follow. So we're temporarily spending back on promotions. And I also want to confirm that on laundry pricing in fact has gone through in line with expectations. And while competition has not followed, which we didn't expect in this one, I think we've also noted the top line growth in laundry and the strong performance also in terms of market share from Clorox liquid bleach. So I would want to make sure that we all understand that the laundry price increase along with all the other price increases are executed very well and are now going in line with plan. Ali Dibadj : And then just on that point in particular around portfolio in general. And maybe this is not how you guys thinking about it. But how I think about your portfolio there is the core legacy business, laundry, bags and wraps. You guys were saying competition is not following, is not a big issue we\u2019re planning for that. To be fair, that worried me a little bit, but I get it. Then you have the international businesses, which is clearly doing better but still pretty volatile here even if you don't include the FX issue. And just on the recent acquisitions, particularly RenewLife, I was surprised to hear already declining. I understand you have some plans behind that. But that makes me a little concerned about your new acquisition declining. And Burt's another lifestyle is doing really well. How do you feel -- it feels like half of business is doing well, half of business is not doing well. How do you characterize the portfolio right now? And Ben for you the level of this much is right on planning doing well. This much isn\u2019t doing that well. I got to work on this and this. How would you characterize the portfolio in those terms? Benno Dorer : So first of all, if you know of a company that does well 100% of the time with the 100% of their businesses. I would love to know who that is. So again set context, I would say that as we've noted, you think about this quarter. We have very strong performance on all businesses in clearing. We have very strong performance on all businesses in lifestyle. Household's litter continues to do very well. And then you have one business that's done super well for us in its first year, and we\u2019ve had some executional issues that are duly noted, but we're getting behind those and they are green shoots and that's RenewLife and we talked about Glad that Kingsford. Clearly, Kingsford is one where we've got a good handle on the issue and we're fixing that. And on Glad, we are seeing temporary issues related to pricing that we've seen before, and then international. So at the end of the day, we're dealing with an FX issue that everybody is dealing, and that's mostly Argentina. We're growing 8% in U.S. dollars across the international business. We're growing profit in U.S. dollars in a very difficult environment. So I would look at the international business actually as doing really well, if you exclude the Argentine peso. So you called 50%, 50%, that's not how we're looking at it. We like our portfolio and we like all our portfolio. We have expectations of every business unit to add to shareholder value. And if you look at it over the long run that's exactly what's happened. And you know, while it's not the case that 100% of the business is doing well, I also say that that gives us an opportunity to do better. I like it if there is businesses that we can fix and there is some of them that we can fix, because that gives us upside. But then again it's hard to feel bashful about how the company is doing when we're sitting at 4% sales growth and gross margin expansion and we're doing exactly what we said we were going to do. So I feel good about the portfolio. And we have a firm handle on the few issues that exist, but the vast majority of the portfolio has done exceptionally well in Q2. And we expect continued strong performance, in particular behind all the innovation that we're focused on launching now in the back half. Operator : Your next question comes from Olivia Tong of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong : I wanted to follow-up on advertising spend. I think you had always planned for advertising to pick-up in the second half, because of the innovation tick-up. But now that we're one quarter closer first is that still the plan, because you've been flattish as the percentage of sales, good first half and driving 3 points of organic sales growth getting price. Do you think increased advertising can drive an acceleration in sales off of the current pace? Or could there be other places to allocate funds, which you think may generate even greater returns? Kevin Jacobsen : What I would say is your right. We've always planned for a heavier back half as it relates to advertising investments. We've got a pretty exciting innovation pipeline that we all have a lot of confidence in, and so we're going to support that driving awareness and trial. But I think it's really in the context of the outlook we provided that we think we've got the right investment level to support the innovation to deliver the outlook we've been talking about today. Olivia Tong : And then if I could follow-up just in terms of the pricing, particularly on charcoal, and bags and wraps where competition didn\u2019t follow. Obviously, the commodities have turned now. But what else do you think allows them not to price? And do you think that puts them in a pretty tough position, because I just think like. Is it to say they are okay with lower margins in you? And if you have any insight into what allows if not to follow through and follow your pricing? Benno Dorer : Yes, Olivia, good clarification on Kingsford. Kingsford pricing is still underway right. So you had remarked that competition is not following, so that's not the case. We are executing Kingsford now and that will be in place this spring. So we are really talking Glad where we are seeing our price increase executed excellence, but we are not seeing competition follow. And that's because we were out early and resin, as we all know, is very volatile and resin costs has softened since we came out with the price increase. So I want to be clear it's still a cost justified price increase. But the resin cost increase is less severe than we had anticipated. And because we were out first, we were out there with pricing and everybody else then didn't follow, because they probably saw that resin is softening. That's happened before and that's where we are addressing with promotional spend. We like our strategy to continue to be focused in this category on trading consumers up, because consumers will not use more trash bags in the future, that's very unlikely. And what we've been on for a period of 15 years now is to effectively trade up consumers with innovation. So we like the mix of taking pricing on one end and rewarding consumers with great innovation backed by strong investments on the other ends. Which is why you saw that even in the quarter where Glad grew margins nicely and grew profits nicely, but where sales were down the core focus, which is our indoor differentiated OdorShield business actually grew volume and sales quite nicely. So that's straight up strategy. It's still working. And I mentioned earlier, we have innovation coming out, it's backed up by solid patents that we are driving now. It is much easier to take pricing and also sustain pricing certainly in the long term. If you have innovation and if you support your brands and we are the only player in that category in trash that does that and that may be explaining the difference in spends that our competitors take as far as pricing is concerned, even though it would be hard for me to speculate. But we think that this combination of innovation backed by pricing continues to be the right strategy for our company even though temporarily we will now spend back on promotions. Operator : Next question comes from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney : I wanted to ask about Burt's Bees natural personal care products overall. Where would you say you are in terms of total distribution versus where you'd like to be for the last 12 months of innovations, first off? Within that what have been the strongest channels for those innovations for the growth you are seeing? Is it more succeeding side by side and beauty displays? Or is it other places that as maybe the heritage of Burt's Bees has that in a little bit? And I noticed you laid out in your deck the pipeline of innovations, I didn\u2019t see any for Burt's Bees second half in '19. Are there plans for more natural personal care products for Burt's Bees that you didn\u2019t mention in there for '19 or for that matter beyond that? Benno Dorer : So strong quarter for Burt's Bees, volume up, sales up high single digits, so feel good about that. The single most important driver continues to be lip care. Just the core lip business grew double digits, and that grew behind innovation and base. Face care also up high single digits, cosmetic up high single-digits, behind innovation and also a strong holiday business. Burt's Bees is a great business that's used for gifting by consumers. And we're always driving that with special gift packs and we did that well in the last quarter. So I'd say in terms of where we are on the business, we certainly continue to have opportunity to drive distribution around new products. We also have opportunity to drive the core business into wide spaces and we have a dedicated team driving that, whether that's convenience stores or other stores where we can drive what we call it lip ubiquity, getting lip balm in the vicinity of where the consumer might be interested in buying that everywhere she goes. So going forward, we feel good about this business and we do have innovation. The fact that we haven't mentioned it maybe more of a factor of having so much innovation across the portfolio, and we have certainly called out Burt's Bees in the past quite a bit. But we have innovation mostly focused on lip, but also in skin care and face care, where we have a variety of masks coming out. Mask is a hot category and we have a detoxifying sheet mask, as well as a clay mask coming out. We have new a facial mist come out. And importantly, we will do TV on face care for the first time this back half, because we can now make the claim that our natural skincare products perform, as well as the synthetic creams out there. And that's a claim that we haven't been able to do before. And that's a claim that we can make based on independent dermatological testing and that we're excited about, because it resonates with consumers in a big way. So that along with pricing, which is effective today, will make for really strong backup on Burt's Bees. And international, we have noted as well that the business is up double digits. And we feel good about the progress that we're making in international, particular in Asia. So we're staying the course on Burt's Bees and this continues to be a business with a lot of potential here domestically, as well as internationally. And of course we like the business, in particular, because its margin profile is accretive to the company and it's the poster child of what we mean when we say we're interested in good growth that's profitable and responsible and sustainable. Operator : Next question comes from Joe Altobello of Raymond James. Joe Altobello : So first on Nutranext and the upside you saw this quarter. It sounds like a lot of that was distribution gains. Was there any greater same store sales as well? Benno Dorer : It's hard to break it down, right now. So I would -- obviously we feel good about Nutranext, Joe, and integration continues to be on track, we are seeing slightly improved trends. But somewhere it also is rounding right, so we\u2019re rounding up now, because the trends are slightly stronger, whereas previously we had to round down. I would call it on track for the fiscal year and perhaps slightly ahead versus where we were in our November call, and that is driven by really robust performance of several of the strategic brands in Nutranext. But we are seeing as we've noted and you've certainly picked up distribution wins with key retailers in Food Drug Mass, also international. And now in the back half, we're beginning to innovate on this business on various brands. So we feel good about where this business is. And think that we are in many really great emerging categories here where our company capabilities can make a difference and where consumers feel like the product are making a difference in their lives. And we stay focused on driving that. So I would call it on track to perhaps slightly ahead, but it's too early to call this a discontinuity in trend just yet. Joe Altobello : And then secondly on charcoal, it's clear you guys are excited about charcoal. But I\u2019m curious how retailers think about the upcoming growing season in your merchandizing program. Are they as excited about your plans to increase alpha penetration? And so could we see a trade load, which seems like what you\u2019re expecting in Q3? Or are they relative there to last year or is it something in between? Thanks. Benno Dorer : Again, we manage inventories pretty tightly. So clearly, retailers have an interest in a strong charcoal business. Why is that? First of all, it's a significant and meaningful business in itself. But also the baskets that the charcoal product is in for the shopper is usually a basket that is North of $100, because consumers by a lot of other things with charcoal that retailers are excited about, whether that\u2019s meat or whether that drinks or potato chips, you name it, so barbecues is a pretty nice shopping occasion. So retailers have interests and we're meeting with a lot of retailers to discuss the 2019 season now. We are getting a lot of support for our plans. So I expect weather permitting 2019 to be a robust grilling season for Kingsford. Operator : Your last question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about litter, because numbers you discussed and some of this business is doing really, really well its quite different in track channels. So I was curious if you could just share with us, one, what you are seeing in terms of competitive pricing activity if you've been -- I think you're a leader there as well. So if you've been followed, how rational the category. Is it a total category look? And then also where some of this stronger performance, is it in club, is it e-commerce? So just curious the channels that are driving this performance? Benno Dorer : So obviously another good quarter by Litter, and pricing certainly executed with excellent, that was the first business that went out with pricing in last summer. We have started to see competition follow, not all competition. But again, I don't think we're done playing this out just yet. This usually takes six to 12 months, so we'll have to see what happens. But in general, we're pleased to see competition follow in that everybody else is seeing the same cost increases too, key drivers behind the performance continues to be innovation. Clean Paws continues to do very well for us. And it's really broad-based, I would say and clearly non-track channels are doing better than track channels, but within that it is broad-based. It\u2019s a business that starts to really well. In e-com also it's one of our faster growing e-commerce businesses that really across the board just signaling the strength of the brand and the strong support that we have by retailers behind Fresh Step, in particular. Lauren Lieberman : Is there a major margin differential for e-commerce versus brick and mortar for litter, because the shipping cost would be probably a bit onerous? Benno Dorer : No, it's about the same, Lauren, as is true for the rest of our portfolio as well. There is no significant margin difference. Again, emphasizing our focus on good growth and profitable growth, so growing e-commerce is a terrific opportunity. Also, because litter is one of the product categories that is really conducive to being purchased on autopilots, because you use it the same way every single day, so this is one where overtime we think that there's an opportunity to build a really efficient business once you hopefully able to lock more and more consumers into automatic repurchases and reordering that can be particularly effective down the road. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would now like to turn the program back over to you. Benno Dorer : Yes. Thank you all for joining us today. And I look forward to speaking with you in May when we share our third quarter results. Have a good day all. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Clorox Company Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. Lisah Burhan : Thanks, Sharon, and welcome, everyone. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, our Chairman and CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for 7 days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com. On today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt-to-EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available on our website as well as in our SEC filings. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release. Please also recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcome could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. I'd also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the tax legislation impact. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The Company undertakes no obligations to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. I'll start by covering our Q3 topline, discussing highlights in each one of our segments. Kevin will then address our financial results and outlook. And finally, we'll turn it over to Benno to provide his perspective, and then close with Q&A. For the total company, Q3 sales grew 2%, reflecting about 3 points of benefit from the Nutranext acquisition, offset by about 3 points of unfavorable foreign currency impact due mainly to the devaluation of the Argentine peso. Sales growth also reflects the benefit of price increases across nearly 50% of our global portfolio. Overall, our pricing plans have played out in line with our expectations with the exception of Glad which I will address shortly. Like we\u2019ve always said, cost justified pricing provides the fuel necessary to reinvest in the brands, which helps drive category growth. Not only are we seeing share growth in majority of the brands that we took pricing in FY 2019, we\u2019re also seeing category improvement in those areas. I'll now go through our results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q3 sales decreased by 1% with growth in Home Care, offset by declines in Laundry and Professional P roducts. Segment sales reflect more than 2 points of headwinds from the substantial difference in the degree of severity of the cold and flu season between this year and last year. This drove lower sales in our disinfecting products, most notably in the wipes and professional products businesses. Home Care grew sales benefiting from double-digit increases for a number of Clorox-branded products and continued success with innovation. Sales of our Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, however, were down this quarter, driven mainly by the significantly milder cold and flu season. For perspective, Wipes category volume declined mid-single digits during the peak cold and flu months this year when it grew strong-double digits during the same period last year, a period classified by the CDC as high severity across all age groups. The Wipes sales decline was also driven by heightened promotional spending by our competitors. This business has enjoyed growth rates in the high-single digits to double digits in the past 10 years with market shares well over 50% for multiple years. With this level of growth, we expect competition to be intense, leading to short-term variability in topline from time-to-time. Over the last decade, we've had periods where we've lost or regained distributions, seen aggressive and dial back promotional spending, and we've seen competitors enter and exit the category. The bottom line is that we believe in the superior value proposition of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and our strong innovation platform, and we're confident that we have the right plans to both address short-term competitive headwinds and drive profitable growth for our brand and the category in the long run. The rest of the Home Care portfolio remains strong with recent pricing actions on track. Sales decreased in our Professional Products business, which was also affected significantly by the milder cold and flu season this year. With illness rates down 27%, hospitalization rates were down 48% as well according to the CDC creating lower demand for products used to clean and disinfect a room after a patient\u2019s day. We believe this is a temporary phenomenon isolated to this quarter. Lastly, within the Cleaning segment, our Laundry business sales declined behind lower volume, partially offset by pricing. Importantly, Clorox Liquid Bleach continued to grow share reaching a five-year high at the end of this quarter, driven mainly by consumers\u2019 continue trade up to our premium Splash-less bleach. Turning to Household segment. Q3 sales decreased by 1%, primarily from declines in Bags and Wraps, which were partially offset by gains in Cat Litter and Charcoal. In Bags and Wraps, sales and shares declined due to lower shipments driven mainly by widened price gaps in the business as well as distribution losses in select portions of the portfolio. Since we took a price increase about eight months ago, the resin environment has changed, not only did our competitors not follow, we\u2019ve also seen a higher promotional spending in the category. As a result, we're doing the following things. First, we are increasing our trade investments to narrow the price gap, and the benefit of those initial investments are expected to be reflected on shelf by Q4. Consistent with what we've seen historically, competitive spending tends to increase when input costs fall. We fully expect this competitive environment to continue at least in the near term. Therefore, we're also assessing other ways to further address the price gaps. Finally, providing superior value remains a focus for us, and our long-term plans will continue to be centered around growing profitably and expanding the category through a robust innovation plan behind proprietary technology and capabilities. Charcoal grew sales in Q3 by pricing and favorable mix. While it's still early, retailer support behind our plans have been strong out of the gate, and the reception of our Kingsford 100% Natural Hardwood Briquettes innovation has been positive. Now, we need to keep executing against our plan for the grilling season, which includes new advertising, packaging upgrades, and innovation. We will also continue to partner with our retailers to aggressively put merchandising programs in place and extend the grilling season. Our focus ultimately is on retaining our loyal consumers and engaging new ones, including millennials to drive household penetration for the Kingsford brand and grow the category. Our Cat Litter business grew sales on top of strong double-digit growth in the year-ago quarter with very strong performance in non-tracked channel. Our Fresh Step brand improved sales broadly across multiple channels, driven by the continued success of our Clean Paws innovation platform, including newly launched scents. The brand also recorded its twelfth consecutive quarter of share growth. With this momentum, we continue to feel confident about the growth trajectory of the business. In RenewLife, sales were down slightly behind an overall category decline. We remain excited about the long-term potential of Digestive Health and RenewLife products, which were rated the number one probiotic brand and consumer satisfaction in 2018 by consumerlab.com. Our focus continues to be on restoring growth in this business. In our Lifestyle segment, sales grew 23% reflecting about 21 points of benefit from the Nutranext acquisition. The one-year anniversary of the acquisition was April 2 and our integration is on track. Our focus in this business is on our strategic brands, which represent about 80% of sales and have higher margins and strong tailwinds while thoughtfully managing our non-core brands in order to drive scale and maximize profitable growth for the company. Burt's Bees recorded another quarter of very strong sales growth despite price increases on a portion of the portfolio. Lip Care had another quarter of double-digit sales growth, which has accomplished in the five of the past six quarters and at least 17th consecutive quarter of sales growth. This growth was driven by ongoing strength of the brand's flagship products. Burt's Bees Beeswax Lip Balm, which was number one in the overall Lip Balm category for the last five weeks in tracked channel. Consumption in Face Care was also up strongly behind it's new newly relaunched sensitive skincare line as well as face mask and towelette innovation, supported by continued strong brand investments and merchandising activities. Brita gross sales for the first consecutive quarter we had successful innovation as well as continued momentum in the fastest growing channel e-commerce. We're also encouraged to see share trends continue to improve in all channels. While it's still early we've seen positive retailer and consumer response to the new Brita premium filtering water bottle the brand's latest product innovation. Food sales decreased slightly in Q3, behind lower category consumption driven mainly by the shift in merchandising timing for the Easter Holiday, which fell in Q4 this year instead of in Q3. The fundamentals of this business remain strong with the hidden value brand, continuing to grow market share and our ready-to-eat dips innovation off to a great start. Finally, turning to our International segment. Sales decreased 5% as the benefit of price increases and volume growth were more than offset by about 18 points of unfavorable foreign currency impact. We feel good about the progress of our Go Lean strategy, which has allowed us not only to substantially offset considerable FX headwinds, but also to improve the profitability of this segment. Importantly, it has allowed us to invest in selected parts of the portfolio that have strong tailwinds and high margins. And we're starting to see the strategy bear fruit, such as in Asia where we've had double-digit sales growth for two consecutive quarters. Now, I will turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss our third quarter financial performance and outlook for fiscal year 2019. Kevin Jacobsen : Thank you, Lisah. And thank you everyone for joining us today. We delivered another quarter of sales and earnings growth and as expected gross margin expansion. As you saw in our press release, we've updated our fiscal outlook, which I'll discuss in a moment. Turning to our financial results for the third quarter. Sales grew 2%, which included about three points of contribution from the Nutranext acquisition, partially offset by about three points of negative impact from the unfavorable foreign currencies, primarily from the devaluation of the Argentine peso. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 43.4%, an increase of 60 basis points compared to 42.8% in the year-ago quarter. Third quarter gross margin included the benefit of 240 basis points from pricing and 170 basis points from cost savings. These factors were partially offset by a 190 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs 70 basis points from unfavorable foreign currency and 50 basis points of higher commodity costs. More perspective, our International business contributed more than half the pricing benefit to gross margin. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 13.9% versus 13.7% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting Nutranext integration expenses. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at about 10%. We're spending for our U.S. retail business coming in over a 11% for the quarter. Our third quarter effective tax rate came in at about 22% versus about 26% in the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by the benefit of U.S. tax reform. Net of these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.44 versus $1.37 in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 5%. Turning to year-to-date cash flow as we noted in our press release, net cash provided by continuing operations was $603 million versus $576 million in the year-ago period. Turning to our outlook. We have updated our fiscal year outlook to reflect two changes, our assumption for sales and our tax rate. Our fiscal year sales outlook is now expected to be in the range of 2% to 3% primarily driven by a significantly milder cold and flu season versus year-ago and heightened competitive activity impacting the Disinfecting Wipes category. In addition, our updated sales outlook reflects lower sales in our Bags and Wraps business related to competitor reaction to the price increase we implemented when we had anticipated a continuation of elevated resin costs. As Lisah mentioned, as resin prices subsided competition did not follow Glad\u2019s price increases. They stepped up their promotional spending resulting in the widening price gaps we are now seeing on shelf. Our sales outlook also continues to anticipate about three points of negative impact from unfavorable foreign currencies, primarily from the devaluation of the Argentine peso. As well as about three points of net benefit from the Nutranext acquisition and the AppleCare divestiture. And as we mentioned in our press release, our fiscal year sales outlook continues to assume about three points of incremental sales from innovation program. Other assumptions for our fiscal outlook remain the same include fiscal year gross margins at about flat, advertising and sales motion spending at about 10% of sales, which continues to reflect higher investment levels in the back half of the fiscal year. Selling and administrative expenses at about 14% of sales, EBIT margin to be down and free cash flow at 11% to 13% of sales. As I mentioned, we've updated our assumption for the fiscal year tax rate, which is now in the range of 20% to 21%. Net of all these factors, we now expect fiscal year diluted EPS to be in the range of $625 to $635, primarily reflecting the benefit of lower fiscal year tax rate, offset by a bit assumption for fiscal year sales. Our fiscal year diluted EPS continues to reflect our estimate of $0.08 to $0.12 of EPS dilution from the Nutranext acquisition in addition to $0.05 to $0.07 of negative impact from tariffs affecting a couple of our business units. In closing, I believe we are largely executing well against our key strategic priorities, including pricing with the exception of Glad. We're actively working to address this. At the same time, we feel good, then the last two quarters, many of the brands that pricing continue to grow share. In addition, as Lisah mentioned, we are also seeing improvement in those categories. We are also pleased that pricing contributed to another quarter of gross margin expansion, giving us fuel needed to continue supporting our brands and categories. Moving forward, we are addressing the following immediate priorities and have stepped up our investments accordingly. First, we're addressing the widened price gaps and heightened competitive promotional spending in the Bags and Wraps category. Second, we're addressing heightened competitive promotional spending and the Disinfecting Wipes category. Additionally, we do anticipate competitive promotional spending in these categories to continue. While our experience demonstrated the promotional spending does not result in sustained category growth, we are prepared to increase own spending in the near-term. We remain committed to investing strongly to support the long-term health of our brands. And with that, I will turn it over to Benno. Benno Dorer : Thanks, Kevin, and thanks everybody for being on the call. I'll start by emphasizing the Clorox remains dedicated to good growth. Growth that's profitable, sustainable and responsible for our company shareholders and retail partners. Our approach to good growth is to invest strongly in our purpose driven brands to deliver superior value beyond industry-leading innovation and strong consumer engagement online, execute pricing and cost savings plans to offset cost pressures and pursue mergers and acquisitions thoughtfully to evolve our portfolio over time. With this in mind, here are the three important takeaways from today's call. First, Clorox's executing well overall against the strategic priorities we set at the start of the fiscal year. We continue to invest strongly in our brands, our multi-year innovation platforms including Clorox Scentiva and Fresh Step Clean Paws continue to perform well. Burt's Bees strong third quarter sales were supported by innovation in Face Care and while early. We are encouraged by the initial results of our latest innovations, including new Kingsford a 100% Natural Hardwood Briquettes, Hidden Valley Ready-to-Eat Dips, and the Brita Filtering Water Bottle. And we are seeing sustained momentum in ecommerce across a number of brands. We continue to expect this channel to be about 8% of company sales this fiscal year. As we had planned for the second half of fiscal 2019, we invested strongly in advertising and sales promotion in our third quarter with investment levels at more than 11% of sales for our U.S. retail business to continue driving awareness and trial behind innovation and to support the long-term health of our brands. We continue to be pleased about our acquisition of Nutranext, which recently reached the one-year mark of joining the Clorox family. We're certainly pleased about the businesses contribution to total company sales and our integration work remains on track. We delivered another quarter of gross margin expansion. Good growth means we're focused on profitable growth versus growth at all cost. We\u2019re pleased that our pricing actions in the U.S. and international as well as our agile enterprise and cost savings programs contributed to gross margin results. Apart from Glad, we're seeing pricing resilience in many parts of our portfolio with continued market share growth in six of nine brands that took pricing, including Clorox bleach, sprays and toilet cleaning products, Fresh Step cat litter, Hidden Valley dressings, and Burt's Bees products. Lastly, we feel very good about the strong progress we are seeing in our international business with continued strong topline momentum in several categories and countries, including two consecutive quarters of double-digit sales growth in Asia. What's more, in the face of significant FX headwinds, our Go Lean Strategy focusing on pricing and cost savings has delivered five consecutive quarters of profit growth. My second message for today is we are aggressively addressing the challenges in the Bags and Wraps and Disinfecting Wipes categories. As Lisa and Kevin mentioned, we're charging ahead with increased investments to address the challenges in these two categories. We have been through this before, and we have a strong track record of getting businesses back to growth. We demonstrated this on the Litter and Brita businesses recently and while early, we are encouraged by the initial progress on Charcoal in the third quarter. Finally, my last point is this, we manage our business for the long-term. As we address the challenges we're facing, our priority remains investing in the long-term health of our brands. Longer term, we anticipate continuing to face elevated competitive spending in select categories make it our pursuit of good growth, more challenging, at least in the near-term. We will be prepared to increase our demand building investments to create superior value and support the long-term health of our brands behind the successor to our 2020 strategy. It's a strategy we're excited to share with you in the fall. What I can tell you now is that our updated strategy will include the key elements we believe are critical for continuing to deliver good growth, investing strongly to innovate how we build our brands with proven and new capabilities, which will help us win in the marketplace, transforming the way we work, including leveraging technology to drive competitive advantage, so that we evolve into an even leaner and faster enterprise. And continuing our commitments to be a mission-driven business as a means to support long-term value creation for all our stakeholders. Operator, you may now open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Dorer. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. I just had some questions on the Nutranext business. So margins in Lifestyle were really weak this quarter. The press release mentioned a couple things like manufacturing and logistics and tariffs, but the ongoing investments to support Nutranext is kind of what stood out to me, so if you could share a little bit of context on what that may or may not have been related to. And then on top of that, I think last quarter, your inventory was up significantly and it was again the case this quarter. So, I was wondering if there was anything related to the margin performance, and Nutranext tied up in that inventory conversation as well. Thanks. Kevin Jacobsen : Good morning, Lauren. This is Kevin, and let me start talking about margin in Lifestyle. What I'd say overall is we continue to feel very good about Nutranext. I think as I've mentioned in the past, we fully expect it to be margin accretive to the company. If you look at our specific results in Q3, I'd highlight a few items in the Lifestyle segment. The first is, and I think you're aware of this, we have the ongoing headwinds from tariffs that are impacting our Brita business unit and that's having a drag on overall profitability. In addition to that I would say two other items, we are leaning into Burt\u2019s advertising, our commitment was as we're taking pricing to recover costs, we would invest that back into the business, and we've done that. And one of the areas we focused on in the third quarter was Burt\u2019s behind our relaunch that Lisa mentioned. So we feel really good about the money we're putting behind the Burt's equity. And then lastly, we've got some integration expenses for Nutranext that continue, and that\u2019s been going on for about 12 months now, and so we continue to integrate that business. But overall, regarding Nutranext, I feel very good about the ongoing profitability of that business. Lauren Lieberman : And on the days inventory piece, Kevin. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, no real change there. It's pretty consistent to what I mentioned last quarter, we were up about $48 million year-over-year at the end of Q3, $46 million was Nutranext, so the base business was essentially flat year-over-year and that was my commitment. Last quarter, we\u2019d worked down the higher inventory as we launched our innovation. We had pre-built some innovation. And as I also mentioned, if you think about Nutranext, it's a relatively small business we've acquired, it was not particularly efficient when we bought it. Their days on hand probably operate in the 120 to 130 days. Clorox generally operates in the 50 to 60 days inventory on hand. So, there are some good work and some good opportunity for us to go through there and make that business more efficient. It will not be our first priority. We're focused on innovation. We're focused on extending distribution, but we will improve the overall turns of that business, but the other comment I'd say is I never expected to be consistent with other parts of our portfolio. They tend to be very high turn items. I think the VMS space in general will be a little bit higher in inventory levels and days on hand because of the complexity, but certainly expect it to be lower than where it is right now. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Great. And then just separately, if I may, the conversation on Wipes, of course appreciate you guys being so forthright about that dynamics have changed for the moment in that category, but I was actually surprised by let's say how sharply you're talking about this even in the prepared remarks, it's sort of, from what we can see in scanning your report, it doesn't look nearly as severe as what you're starting to describe where you're kind of talking with the long-term track record. And so, if you could offer a little bit more detail perhaps on what it is that you're seeing, I would have thought perhaps it was just things got a little more promotional because there was inventory out there, people didn't get that sick. Okay. More promotion to kind of move the category, but this sounds like something more sustained that you're worried about in kind of gearing up the site, so a little bit more context there would probably be pretty helpful. Benno Dorer : I'll be happy to Lauren. I think we want to separate Q3 and then what we were expecting going forward. If you think about Q3, as Lisa mentioned, Wipes was down. To give a perspective, that was 1 point in headwind to the Company and 2 points of headwind for the Cleaning segment. And the majority of that was cold and flu, pretty mild cold and flu season this year compared to a very severe cold and flu season last year. Last year, according to several metrics and the CDC, it was the most severe cold and flu season since 2009 for perspective. So the delta this year versus last year, pretty extreme, and that accounts for the majority of the weakness. Said that to a lesser extent in Q3, we did see an increase in competitive promotional spending certainly towards the end of the quarter, and we expect that to be continuing. So the cold and flu impact is certainly one-time, and hopefully will help next year if there is more average cold and flu season. But the competitive promotional spending, we do expect that to be sticky and we will defend against it and spend against it mostly to strengthen our own merchandising planning in Q4 and beyond. So this is something that we've seen in the past. If you look at the past 10 years, we've been here before. Generally, we've had most years with very strong growth in Wipes, but we have had years in particular following particularly strong sales and share growth and we've certainly seen that on this business over the last few years, where we have seen a little bit of a correction, where competitors branded and private label, spend back in trade promotion to defend their own share. So if you look at the last 10 years of share in Disinfecting Wipes, we've been as high as mid 50s, we've dropped back down to 47 in 2014, then back up to the mid 50s in 2018, and what you're seeing now it's dropped back in tracked channels below 50%. So, very consistent with what we are seeing every few years. It's a hotly contested category. We're the innovation leader. We\u2019re the spending leader. We have the superior equity. Our brand has seen as better in value. So what that means is as competitors are under pressure they sometimes react with increased promotional spending, and that's what we're seeing now. We're applying the recipe that we've always applied, which is to defend short-term to make sure that competitors understand that this is not the way to grow this category, but then also to continue to drive our strengths long term the strengths certainly, our innovation and our brand equity building, advertising, and sales promotion. To be clear, trading down in this category does not work for the category long term. So as you think about what retailers will see as this promotional support happens right now in the marketplace is that the category growth is easing up, and over time, what we've seen in the past is that the market gets back to rational behavior and driving the category the right way, which is through innovation and advertising and trading in consumers in ways that are sustainable. So nutshell, not a new situation, something that happens periodically, something that certainly happens right now is resin costs has eased up a little bit, but it's something that we know how to deal with. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS. Steven Strycula : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for the candid remarks. So with the updated guidance wanted some clarification on how we think about Q4. If I'm backing into it correctly, I think domestic sales were down almost about a half-point this quarter. So within your implied guidance, what kind of gets better in Q4 and does domestic business get back to call it a 1% or better growth rate? Thank you. Kevin Jacobsen : Hi Steve. This is Kevin. And I'll take the question. As I'm sure, you\u2019re going to appreciate, we don't provide quarterly outlook. I\u2019ll speak to the full-year, but with nine months in the books, I assume you can back into this. We've updated our topline outlook. I would say there is no change in Nutranext and no change in the impact of FX, they're essentially equal and offsetting, and that leaves our base business growth rate about 2% to 3%. I think what that really highlight is as Benno mentioned, we did see the slowdown in Q3 specifically associated with cold and flu, that's transitory. I don't worry too much about that issue going forward. But the challenge we have particularly in our Bags and Wraps business with the widened price gaps that's something we'll see not only in Q3, but will continue into Q4 as we work to address the price gap. So I would expect a portion of what we're seeing this quarter to carry forward next quarter, but I don't expect the impact of cold and flu to carry forward into the quarter, but will certainly impact the full-year. Steven Strycula : And then a quick follow-up for Benno. On the Charcoal business, I was pleased to see that it sounds like the volumes grew. What's really driving that just given that the category was a little bit weaker last year from a market share perspective? Thanks. I'll pass it on. Benno Dorer : Thanks, Steve. So feeling good about Q3, growth in sales came behind pricing and mix. We've certainly seen a strong retailer acceptance to our selling plans for the new grilling season which really kicks off this quarter. Pricing is also underway and on track and we expect the sell through to be complete during Q4. So a lot of the things that we talked about in the last quarter are working so far pricing in particular of course has given us the fuel to invest in this business, which has credibly important in particular, as it comes to driving household penetration by engaging millennials and by continuing to drive frequency of use through strong merchandising to create impulse purchases. So encouraged by the return to strength in Q3 mainly behind retail engagement. Now what we need to see is that strong retail engagement and the expected strong merchandising plans flow through to the consumer hopefully also aided by a more normal weather compared to last fiscal year. So feel good where they stand. One quarter out of the gates. But the main grilling season is ahead of us and we're focused on engaging our consumer to keep growing the business in line with what we've come to expect over a number of years on Charcoal. Lisah Burhan : Steve, for the record, solid sales growth for coal, but volume is down consistent with pricing. Operator : Your next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo Securities. Joseph Lachky : Hi. It\u2019s actually Joe Lachky calling in for Bonnie. So I wanted to ask about gross margins. So your fiscal 2019 guidance was flat implies Q4 gross margin will be up, but not as much as it was in Q3 and Q2, so I was kind of curious about the puts and takes there. And the reason for the slowdown in momentum and I know you have increased promos coming in and that's probably part of it. And then longer term on gross margin, I know you won't give fiscal 2020 guidance until next quarter, but maybe if you could talk about your confidence in maintaining margin expansion into fiscal year 2020. For example, do you expect the pricing impact to continue to accelerate and how should we think about commodities and manufacturing and logistics going forward? Thanks. Kevin Jacobsen : Thanks, Joe. Let me start with this fiscal year. I know you got a few questions here. As it relates to this fiscal year, if I think about flat for the year, we were down about 50 bps in the first half of the year, which would require us to be up about 50 bps in the back half of the year. In Q3, we saw we\u2019re up about 60, so pretty much in line with what I expected. As I think about Q4, I think it's mostly playing out as we expected, although the one changes and you mentioned it, I do expect to see heightened trade spending would have a little bit of a negative effect on gross margin. So I still feel comfortable about flat is right, but importantly it will reflect three quarters in a row of margin expansion. And as we've talked about, that's incredibly important to us as we've taken pricing to get back to growing gross margins, it's allowing us to increase investments in the brands, which is how we create long-term value. So that model is working well for us and we are very much on track this year to do that. In regard to fiscal year 2020. As you may know, we do not have a gross margin goal, we have EBIT margin goals of 25 to 50 bps and while I won't provide an outlook yet for 2020, we're in the process right now of finalizing our plans next year, but we remain committed to expanding EBIT margin 25 to 50 bps over time, but we'll get back to you in August and give you more details about fiscal year 2020. Joseph Lachky : And then just one follow-up on pricing, and then I'll pass it along. I guess, are you planning on, I know you've taken pricing across the vast majority of our portfolio, already, but are you planning on taking any incremental pricing in the near-term, and specifically thinking international where your price mix hasn't been able to offset that severe FX headwinds the last few quarters. Thanks. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, I would say we've executed a tremendous amount of price internationally and in fact we haven't talked about it a lot, but if you look at our total pricing benefit of about 240 bps this quarter about two thirds of the pricing benefit we're generating from our international division, and they have done an excellent job executing pricing and it's resulting in improving profitability. If you've seen our results, I believe over the first three quarters of the year, we've grown profit about 12% internationally. And importantly, we've returned to international gross margin expansion as well. So the pricing work internationally has been excellent and is delivering increased value very similar to the U.S. Every year, we will look at the markets and decide it was to appropriate take pricing based on inflation. We price towards the medium-term cost environment and so while we've executed quite a bit of pricing this year not prepared to discuss our pricing plans for fiscal year 2020 at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara, your line is open. Dara Mohsenian : Hey guys, sorry about that. So I just wanted to parse through the Charcoal side of the business. It sounded like you performed pretty well in the quarter which surprised me because the track channel data looks off. So was that just stronger growth on the untracked side of the business were shipments ahead of retail sales, perhaps aided by the pipeline fill for the natural innovation, any clarity there would be helpful. And then also just from a longer-term perspective, I was hoping for more of sort of a broader state of the union on Charcoal, A, the category itself, it looks like household penetration maybe decelerating a bit with the shift to pellet grilling, et cetera. Is that the case from the data you see are really not a big issue? And secondly, your market share performance in the track channels, it looks like it's weekend with the shift to some of the all-natural competitors. So any commentary there would be helpful again on household penetration and your market share performance. Thanks. Benno Dorer : Yes. Dara, first of all, tractors is non-tracked as is the case across most of the businesses, non-tracked channel performance is stronger perspective. We grew volume across the total company last quarter at non-tracked channels and that's certainly also two for charcoal and remember that non-tracked channels account for 30% to 40% many of our businesses total sales. So it's pretty significant. So pretty different performance there did not built any inventory beyond what we\u2019re seeing normally heading into the acrylic season. Certainly what we've talked about before. So, really what I have to say on charcoal is nothing new relative to what commented on in the last quarter. Last quarter, what we said is that we're focused on driving household penetration by reengaging millennials. We're doing that by spending incremental dollars, the dollars that we're earning through price increases in target media for new advertising, through new graphics, through 100% hardwood innovation, which is off to a good start and we're also doing that by continuing to engage retailers to drive frequency of use, strong merchandising plans are critical to create impulse purchases because the charcoal purchase is often, an impulse purchase in store and displays work and we are engaging retailers to make sure we have strong plans in place as the grilling season kicks into high gear. So nothing new other than that one quarter in against the plan that we talked about last quarter, we're feeling good about the progress that we're making in particular with retailers and we are focused on the same priorities one quarter at a time. And that's, that's the story in short on Charcoal. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. And then Benno on the pricing front, just for a broader perspective, I guess the tone in the call and the comments around Wipes in trash bags stands out to bid in contrast to a very confident home, we heard from you guys, a couple of quarters back when you put the pricing plans into place. So I'd just love the get sort of a post modem on any lessons learned around how you implement price increases with the competitive issues that have emerged in Wipes in trash bags. It's more just a couple of categories were competitive issues ramped up and it is what it is or is there sort of better ways to manage it going forward? Thanks. Benno Dorer : Yes. So upfront, I would like to separate Wipes and trash bags and I want to reemphasize as did Kevin and Lisah before that the issue that we're dealing with in the short-term on Wipes is one of competitive promotional spend, but not related to pricing. Okay. So let me unpack this a little bit. First of all, did we execute our plan on pricing? Yes, we did. About 50% of the portfolio mix of U.S. and international pass-through in line with expectations on all of the businesses. So, that's all good news and consistent with what we said in the past. Second, is it working? Yes, it is working with one exception. That is not inconsistent with what we said in the past, we have talked about Glad and the emerging concerned the competitors did not follow in the last quarter and what we certainly see now is that they still haven't followed, but they also now started to spend back. So that's one issue that we're dealing with, but other than that it's working. First of all, because of the gross margin expansion that you've seen them that have given us the fuel to invest in growth for the company, it's working because two-third of the categories where we took pricing up in share, it's working because the categories where we took pricing, post pricing are tending higher. So, we are seeing stronger category growth, which means more money in the pockets for retailers and it's also working because price elasticities even though early post, the price increases, but the data that we have the vast majority of brands are stable or in some cases, even better than pre-pricing. So that checks off all the boxes that we've talked about in the past and it tells you that the Clorox Company knows how to take pricing. Are we experiencing the bumpiness that with anticipated to you in the last few quarters where we've talked about pricing? Yes, we're seeing that. We're seeing that in particular on Glad and as Lisah and Kevin have said, we are addressing the wide price gaps there aggressively. But other than that it's working, pricing still cost justified our analytics are showing that we can predict what's happening in the marketplace and beyond Glad, we're very confident at the success behind pricing and also confident that these price increases will be sustained in the marketplace. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good afternoon, folks. Thanks for spot me in. Two questions, first, a really quick one, the tax rate for the year, should we expect to sustain or should we be modeling the step-up into next year. Benno Dorer : Hi Jason. Yes, thanks for the question on tax rate. As you saw our expectations this year 20% - 21%, I would say, driven by two items beyond the obvious benefit of tax reform. We've seen a much higher level of stock option exercise activity and you might recall, a number of years ago there is accounting change that provides excess tax benefits associated with stock option activity. So, that is certainly impacting our results this year. We've also had a couple of settlements with some state and federal authorities and these tend to take years to resolve in the hard to predict, but we've had a couple of settlements that impacted our rate this year. So while we're enjoying a lower rate this year. As you think about next year, I would encourage you think about a more normalized tax rate for us, if you think about a statutory federal rate of 21%, state rate of about 3%. I expect mid 20s ongoing. And so I've enjoyed the benefit this year. I don't expect to see either level of stock option exercise activity or the tax settlements that we had this year. And I think that will generate about 300 basis point increase in the rate next year, year-over-year. Jason English : Thank you for that. My next questions on innovation, you certainly had some great success in the past couple of years and you've touted many initiatives on the call today. But when we grind through some of the data, it looks like maybe net innovations beginning to slow. We're looking at Scentiva branded, and it's across all categories, it's slowed quite a bit with prior launches and things like bathroom cleaners, declining and kind of offsetting the gains in your new mop cloths, your new sulfur-type products and toilet ones and when we look across your aggregate portfolio, your total distribution points are declining solid mid-single digit clip suggest sort of SKU is sort of shrinking. Can you give us some color and context on what's happening in driving some of these metrics in that direction? Benno Dorer : Yes, Jason, a lot to unpack. First of all, innovation on track overall feeling good about innovation both to longer-term platforms, you've mentioned one of them Scentiva \u2013 also clean pause and the PPT platforms, really good Scentiva the particular comment I would make is that what's great about \u2013 Scentiva is that it brings in new consumers into the franchise 70% of the purchases from new consumers. So that tells you that we're continuing to feel good about the ability to attract new users with innovation. The more recent innovation from this back half, while early all feeling really encouraged whether that's Glad with its LeakGuard technology, which builds of the technology platform, with more than 40 patents and is off to a nice start Hidden Valley Ranch dips with three flavors essentially doubles. The access that we have on this brand to usage this occasions and feeling good about how that's doing out of the gates. We talked about Kingsport the premium filtering bottle is doing great. Consumers are spending $15 billion on bottled water every year and the majority in home. So we feel good about the ability to attract consumers in home, but also out of home with this bottle especially because single use plastic continues to be under attack. We talked about Burt's Bees lot of innovation in lip and face, including new Lip Balm flavors new face masks, towelettes and sensitive skin care relaunch which we've supported with TV and has led to really strong growth in the Face Care arena. And then Scentiva wet mopping costs of course as an entrance in the sizable convenient screen platforms. So across-the-board feeling good overall certainly early but indications are all positive. I would perhaps separate that from the distribution comment that you made. First of all, I would remind everybody that again tracked channels only account for a portion of the business and that the business performance is much stronger non-tracked channels. But as you unpack distribution, we're seeing some very some gains in some businesses like Brita and Cleaning and Cat Litter and we did see some losses in other businesses. And I would however perhaps tie those two the things that we're working with. First of all bumpiness post pricing, if you listen to our comments in the last few quarters, we have said that bumpiness post pricing can mean that retailers could react with lower distribution temporarily, that's something that we used to and something we've anticipated to you and something we know how to work through over time. And we're also in the speed of driving growth, that's profitable, sustainable and responsible and we call this good growth. We're not afraid to accept distribution losses unless strategic parts of the portfolio, give you a few examples. And in Glad we've lost some distribution on trash behind the discontinuation of our quick tie business, which is lower tier trash, lower margin in order to continue to facilitate the trade up into the more profitable premium skews. In food, what you have seen as a temporary discontinuation of skews, which will be replaced with innovation and make space for future growth. So this is not uncommon. We're remaining comfortable with where we are and if I look at our track record of building distribution overtime, I feel good. We do it the right way behind innovation. We do it because we are the leading investors in our category. We do it behind customer capabilities, we are confident and we do it with SKUs, which overall tend to have a higher productivity on shelf than those of our competitors and retailers know this. So feeling good about where we are in-store and again would perhaps not high what you're seeing on distribution through innovation. We feel good about innovation portfolio. Jason English : Got it. Thank you. Very helpful. I'll pass it on. Operator : Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi. I don't mean to beat a dead horse, but I guess my one question on the Glad Bags specifically is just one of the things we've heard today. As oh gosh, this is the death knell in the business. This means that private label has finally taken over and everybody's buying Solimo and not Glad. So I guess obviously dramatic over reaction, but just what gives you confidence that I'll maybe that is not the case and maybe in terms of what you see in terms of non-track channel market shares, I mean, what gives you confidence that some pricing adjustments and trying to bring some new innovation to the category really is going to bring back growth in this isn't some sort of structural change in the category. And to that point, I guess one of the things you had said a couple quarters ago or two quarters ago I think was that the stock what kind of rich in your view and you wouldn't be buying back much more stock at the current price, but what's your sentiment now where you're thinking now about share repurchases and not just looking at the stock today, but also reflecting your confidence in your outlook for the fourth quarter and thinking about 2020 is now a place where you think about stepping in and supporting the stock? Thanks. Benno Dorer : Yes. Let\u2019s Kevin comment on stock repurchase would want to make it clear that we did not comment on that. We never do. We also certainly didn't comment or make comments that you talked about Wendy and your ingoing remarks on Glad Bags. What gives me confidence and I want to be clear, there is absolutely nothing in here that points to a structural change. The thing that gives me confidence is that we've been here before and we know how to manage this. If you look back at the Glad business and I personally been involved in it Glad business for 16 years, what you're seeing is when resin falls and it's certainly come in lighter, over the last few months promotional dollars flow into the category. So that's what's happened. And what we've always done successfully is to defend against that and we have commented that that's what we're doing now. What we've also seen is that competition has not followed through a price increase. Again, that's something that we have seen before and we know how to manage that. So this is tactical. This is a phenomenon like one that we have seen in the past and one that we know how to manage. And that's all there is. And then Kevin can perhaps comment on repurchases. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure Wendy. In regard to repurchases and maybe just to reconnect to our program. I think many you folks know we have authorization for up to $2 billion share repurchase program, the Board approved back in May. To date, I've execute about 9% that program returned about $178 million to shareholders. And then specifically this year, if I think about total cash returns through the first nine months, we've returned about $675 million to shareholders. That\u2019s split pretty equally between dividends and share repurchases. And that's up about 75% versus the prior year, over the first nine months, really driven by both a significant dividend increase, we took last May of 14% plus we've stepped up share repurchases, both for open market and dilution management. And then specific to Q3, we've returned about $200 million to shareholders about two-thirds of that is the dividend about a third share repurchases. We repurchased about $73 million and I sign that all dilution management. As I look forward, I won't comment on our actions going forward, but I will reaffirm that we have a very disciplined approach to how we'll execute the program. There is no time limit on it and by design, it is not an ASR that gives us plenty of flexibility, but I am certainly committed to updating folks every quarter on our progress. But certainly won't share going forward in terms of the express criteria. Wendy Nicholson : Both of those are very helpful. Thank you. Benno Dorer : Thanks Wendy. Operator : Next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Hi, thank you for squeezing me. So I have a follow-up on Nutranext from a topline perspective, I know you discussed a little bit on the margin side? What is the other line performance of the brand now that you've owned for about a year. In all math, it looks like your sales are growing only like low single-digits, I don\u2019t say to mid single-digit range. So wanted to double check on a like-for-like basis. And was that in line with your expectations going in and if you can talk about opportunities on potentially accelerating that growth going forward. And if you can layer that with the category challenges that your face with RenewLife is that also hurting Nutranext? Thank you. Benno Dorer : Andrea, if you are good about Nutranext integration remains on track, which certainly has been our year one focus. Now we are in year two and integration, I would say is that a good part behind us feeling good about where the businesses, which includes topline growth. Our focus is, first of all on expanding distribution and we're seeing that across Food, Drug, Mass and Club making really good progress. Our focus also is on starting to bring in innovation, we're launching on NeoCell one of our strategic brands, collagen protein peptides that is a fast growing category that combines two trends collagen and protein and innovation that we feel bullish about. And then third, as you'd expect from us, we're also managing the portfolio differentially we've acquired seven brands, about 80% of those brands, we consider to be strategic. And we're investing heavily into the growth of this business and then about 20% is non-strategic and we manage that as a fuel business just like we do with other parts of our portfolio, outside Nutranext and that in turn generates profit for the strategic businesses. So, Nutranext had a strong Q3. We like the business, we like where it's going. And we like how our team managed it and we're certainly committed to invest in the business and also not afraid to increase investments in the business. Should we feel like that's necessary. And we can certainly update you on our 20 plans in the next quarter. As we have commented in the past you know Nutranext and RenewLife are separate businesses as far as some of the issues that hold RenewLife back temporarily now. So, we feel good about Nutranext and remain bullish on the growth that we're seeing on that business. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, Benno. Benno Dorer : Thanks, Andrea. Operator : Your next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney : Good morning. Thanks very much. When I look across all your categories, I guess the flipside of Jason\u2019s question. Your dollar sales per total points of distribution are growing mid single-digit for the company as a whole with that loss for distribution. And it's really pretty consistent across categories, each of which seem to have their own dynamics, it seems pretty unlikely that every single bottoms up analytic would be pointing to that being the strategy. So, I mean, is there some aspect of this. That's a thoughtful transfer of less hardworking measured retail points that might be losing traffic towards alternate channels that are generally gaining traffic like e-commerce, et cetera. And as part of that do you have, you mentioned analytics earlier Benno. Do you have when you lose distribution in somebody's places, particularly your larger categories. Do you have household usage data, loyalty data that gives you the confidence that these are maybe the right moves, particularly on the pricing side? Thank you. Benno Dorer : Yes, again, first of all, just to have a differentiated point of view on distribution were growing distribution in some categories and we're not growing in some other categories. I like where you were going on dollar sales as a point of distribution that of course has a lot to do with two things. First of all, pricing is working as we have commented. Second, simplification in the category, which sometimes means less distribution and our SKUs too, is a good strategy because in many categories shelves are over skewed in there too many brands that shelf and you know that doesn't necessarily help the consumer find what they want. As they spend a limited time in front of the shelves. What we do find is that thoughtfully managing distribution unless strategic SKUs enough comment on that before on this call, is a good idea and I use Glad Trash as an example. We're eliminating very low margin, lower priced SKUs that don't add value to the category and don't add value to our brand is smart if it helps consumers trade into the right SKUs, which tend to be more profitable, which tend to be a higher price and which tend to grow the category for retailers. So that's something that we do. That's something that we'd backup analytics both pre and post and something that we worked with our retailers on an ongoing basis. So at the end of the day, while I'd always in an ideal world like to gain distribution on all of our businesses, all the time, sometimes as it relates to bumpiness post pricing and as it relates to managing distribution thoughtfully and non-strategic businesses, it does lead to lower distribution on some of the businesses. But again, in the long run, I feel good about where we stand, but feel good about the growth plans that we have with retailers and I feel good about our ability to continue our strong track record to grow distribution on businesses over time. Jonathan Feeney : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein Research. Ali Dibadj : Hey guys. So, I guess I still want to get to, if we can the root cause of some of the \u201cbumpiness\u201d as you call it Benno. You just contextualize that I'm sure you guys have seen a lot of the other peer reports and none of them have really had bumpiness this quarter in terms of taking pricing and pricing up for a while. And so I'm trying to figure out why you guys, yes, and then no so much. What are the characteristics I guess another way to ask it about the Bags and Wraps and Wipes categories maybe historically the Cat Litter category, a little while ago is a private label versus brand mix, have you guys analyze things that commodities as percentage of COGS? Is it brand strength? Is a price gap? And I guess on the last one, if it is price gap, there are many categories of yours that we see the price gaps have expand the lot, nothing happened to the share we agree yet. But, the price gap spend a lot. So I guess really trying to understand how you think, why you think characteristics of the category exist that you think, this price bumpiness is only a bump and only isolated to these two categories? Benno Dorer : Yes, Ali. So thank you for the question. First of all, I don't want to compare our company to others. I feel like that's perhaps something that you guys can do better. I'd certainly ask if you see as much pricing from your competitors and as much positive gross margin impact from your competitors, so that as we compare Clorox's performance to other companies, we take everything into consideration, but just to reiterate that we feel good about where we are on pricing. We talked about bumpiness. And we're seeing that in particular on Glad. As I also said before on Wipes, heightened competitive promotional activity is not tied to pricing. So we feel like pricing does exactly what we said it would do, it helps build gross margin, it helps us build market share in the majority of the categories where we took it. It helps grow the categories in the vast majority of categories where we took it. And there is one issue that we're dealing with on Glad and that's an issue that we've dealt with in the past because clearly, resin costs today are different than where they were at the time when we took pricing and that's what usually happens that you see widen price gaps and you'll see more promotional activity. And then what you'll see us do is react and then you will see those activities subside and you see sales and market share performance stabilized and grow over time because our equity building efforts take hold again. I want to make sure I remind everybody that on Glad the increased trade spend that we put in place starts to take effect in Q4, not in Q3 and that we're certainly also looking at ways to continue that in further quarters. So again there is really, no news here on pricing. The bumpiness in Glad is one that we had expected, one that has accelerated as resin costs have subsided and one that we know how to manage. Ali Dibadj : And so just to push further on Glad. As you think about spending an extra $1 in that business to deal with the bumpiness, let's just call it and the short-term bumpiness here, would you rather spend $1 there given that you know this might happen again as commodities roll-up and then back down and to your point, all of us you have lived it for 16 years. Would you rather spend the money there \u2013 the dollar there or in another category, and I ask that in the context of M&A and divestitures in particular of the value it continues to bring or not to your portfolio. And I know in the past you said, we love our portfolio, we love our portfolio. But again, I'm not trying to make a big deal about this one instance, but it is a repeated instance whenever commodities go up or down. Benno Dorer : Yes. So we still have our portfolio. Ali thanks for the questions. There is nothing changed there and we still have the Glad business, it's driven a lot of value for our shareholders over the last 16 years for sure and we are confident that we'll continue to drive a lot of value in that we have a strategy that continues to work behind a lot of patent and intellectual property protected innovations that are yet to come on this business. So I would say to your question, would I rather spend the dollars here or elsewhere. There's not an either or question, we're spending the dollars on Nutranext, on Burt's Bees. As Kevin has commented earlier, we are increasing our investments in Burt's Bees, certainly willing to lean into Nutranext, also willing more than we perhaps have two, three years ago to lean into profitable growth areas in international where we're seeing nice success not only through pricing, but also on our brand building efforts whether that's in Burt's Bees Asia, or whether that's on Cat Litter, other parts of the portfolio or international where we have seen really nice volume growth in China. We've seen a nice volume growth in Europe in Q3, Mexico, Canada all solid and robust markets and we have commented that we are interested in investing more in that part of the business. Our priority certainly continues to be to invest in profitable growth and the long-term brand health of our businesses, our priority continues to be to spend in activities that are driving brand equities behind innovation and the superior value of our brands. But we also not afraid to defend the businesses where we have to and certainly, big businesses like Glad Trash and Clorox Disinfecting Wipes out two businesses where we're not going to let our competitors steal share from us in ways that are not productive for categories and brands in the long-term. So this is not a question of either or spending on Glad or elsewhere, but the answer here is always and. Ali Dibadj : Okay. And then just my last question if I may, in that context of spending back, is it 10% of advertising of the trends of sales still applicable for this year, that's a couple 100 basis points up in Q4 to get there? Benno Dorer : Yes, it's still the same number for this fiscal year and higher in the U.S. remember, and also higher in the back half. So it's still the right number for this fiscal year, early. Ali Dibadj : Okay, thanks very much. Benno Dorer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Like you talked a lot about the competitive headwinds in Glad and Wipes already, but I guess just to round it out. I'd love to get a better sense of how long you expect to last as a base case Wipes seems like a, it's a relatively new competitive front of opened up, but any thoughts on duration there just given your past experience will be great. And then, I'm glad we're the issues have been known for while discussed for a while, I guess you could point to your actions that are coming in the fourth quarter as well as higher oil as perhaps the reason for some relief. But on the other hand, natural gas conditions seem to favor lower resin prices for longer. And it sounds like maybe Lisah and I don\u2019t want \u2013 maybe Lisah may have alluded to some actual list price rollbacks or other initiatives in her opening remarks in Glad. So just if you can comment on that as well and whether I miss misread or comments that'd be great. Benno Dorer : Yes. Thanks, Steve. So, first of all, impossible. How long this is going to last, because it certainly will depend on input costs to a certain extent, which is the reason why we're sitting here in the first. So it's like looking into a crystal ball, but I would say as a base case, typically what we have seen in the past on Glad, but also Wipes, this is not a new phenomenon Wipes, this is something that we have seen in the past before. It takes a few quarters. And I would assume that that's a good assumption. In this case two and I would also assume if I were you that we are planning for that always remaining agile should the situation changed. But our assumption is that this is going to take a few quarters. On Glad what we have commented on is that we will we have put trade dollars in place for Q4. But that we're looking at further actions beyond Q4 and we'll update you in August on our thinking for fiscal year 2020. Steve Powers : Okay, fair enough. And I guess just a real quick one, another thing that I just want to clarify from the opening. Just going back to Lifestyle for a moment, it sounded a little bit like a stark or distinction in the discussion that segment between core and non-core brands and just trying to get a sense of if that's a change or not is the message now that you're going to manage more for profits versus growth or is there a more nuanced takeaway there that you want to walk away with. Benno Dorer : Thanks for allowing us to clarify their thesis that was not clear, so the distinction we may between strategic and non-strategic was within Nutranext, 80% of the business strategic 20% non-strategic. We have commented on only part of the portfolio being strategic in the past. Now we're giving you more of a quantification 80%, 20% and, as you'd expect over time portfolio management and also more aggressive portfolio management is part of what we do across all of our company and we'll be a stronger part of our year-to-management of this business, where we largely moving on from integration, but it's no change. And it certainly doesn't affect lifestyle more broadly, obviously lifestyle is a business where if you just look at Burt's Bees as examples several of the businesses are located that we view as strategic growth businesses for the company. Steve Powers : Right, okay. That makes sense. I obviously miss that. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to pull together yes, a number of the topics that have been asked on this call. Really forward looking appropriateness of investment levels relative to what you're seeing now with respect to market share. We spent a lot of time on Bags and Wraps that sort of characterize as more tactical fine as you look at the Nielsen data companies also losing some share in charcoal litter cleaners, et cetera, and of course this is within the context, we've seen a number of CPG companies take up advertising marketing levels among other levers pretty significantly this year. I just want to make sure I'm clear here on this call. So, without guiding the fiscal 2020, Kevin mentioned some comfort with the 25 to 50 basis points of margin improvement. Longer term, but a couple of things, number one, can you confirm you generally comfortable with investment levels. And then the second piece to that are you prepared to take any sort of major step-up in investment levels for fiscal 2020 off the table without providing guidance for next year. Thanks for that. Benno Dorer : Yes, Kevin \u201cwithout providing guidance for next year\u201d, if I just maybe just take a step back. So we'll continue to invest in the strategy that we have confidence in with emphasis on innovation engaging consumers digitally and drive a superior value on our brands. For the fiscal year to 10% as I've commented before 10% of sales higher in the U.S. higher in the back half that's still a right assumption and of course like, like we said we'll update you on August, we're always evaluating the right spending levels we certainly think that the competitive activity and trash and Wipes, as I said, we'll stay elevated and will continue to rise require our attention. But as we look at our number for fiscal year 2020 would perhaps say that the most important thing here is that we will continue to have a principal approach to spending in advertising and sales promotion. We're not afraid to defend our businesses if this costs money where needed, especially if you feel like it's necessary to keep the brands healthy long-term. We are also staying focused on investing behind the strategy and we're certainly prioritizing investments in the long-term brand health where we see the opportunity and where we feel like we've got particularly strong ROI is an we commented that during this call on a few businesses like Burt's Bees where we certainly that feel like that's the case. Food behind innovation Nutranext International, so, are we seeing more spend in some of our categories, yes. We taken the long-term approach, yes. Are we willing to consider an increase in spending levels for fiscal year 2020? Yes, if we feel like that's the right thing to do short-term and long-term, and that's about as much as I think I can say at this point, and the details behind that statement will then come in August. Is that okay? Kevin Grundy : I appreciate the color. Thanks Benno. Good luck. Benno Dorer : Thanks, Kevin. Lisah Burhan : We\u2019ll take our last question. Operator : And we have a question from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. I appreciate it. I'll keep it quick. Just I guess relative to your expectations, what was particularly surprising to you? Because you know, the Bags and Wraps competition we've been talking about for some time and clearly a little bit more elevated. But it's been going on for some time, cold and flu season, we already knew the comps obviously, it was coming. So I guess I just want to better understand relative to your going in expectations, what was surprising and how fast you think you can pivot on, on some of these things, whether it's Wipes PPD and Bags and Wraps. Thanks so much. Benno Dorer : Yes. Thanks, Olivia. I need a really quick answer. The thing that surprised us was cold and flu, cold and flu. Normally it doesn't have that much of an impact as long as you're staying year-on-year within a certain threshold, but particularly mild a year compared to a very severe last year. It did impact our business more strongly than we had anticipated. And we've commented on that. And then I would say Bags and Wraps, it has elevated over time as we think about, um, the, the competitive merchandising activity as we went all through the quarter. And that's something that we are prepared to spend against. So it's really those two. Everything else, execution against the strategy, on track innovation, marketing spend, ecommerce seeing very strong growth with the biggest ECOM customer pricing executed well, cost savings, strong momentum on international neutral, Exxon on track. So all the things that give us confidence in the strategy. We have executed well feeling good about strong results across many parts of the portfolio and we commented on many of those during this call. So that it's really a cold and flu for the quarter and we've reflected it in the sales outlook and Bags and Wraps, which we have to address, that it. Olivia Tong : Great, thank you. Benno Dorer : Thanks, Olivia. Benno Dorer : And thank you everyone. I look forward to speaking with you again in August when we share with you our fiscal year 2019 results. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. Lisah Burhan : Thanks, Sharon, and welcome, everyone. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, our Chairman and CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website thecloroxcompany.com. On today's call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA, organic sales growth, and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks, or supplemental information available on our website as well as in our SEC filings. In particular it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release. Please also recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release. Please review our most recent 10-K filings with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. I'll start by covering our topline commentary discussing highlights in each of our segments, Kevin will then address our financial results as well as outlook for the fiscal year 2020, and finally, Benno will offer his perspective, and we'll close with Q&A. For the total company, full year sales were up 1%, while Q4 sales decreased 4%, reflecting double-digit sales decline in our Household segment. I'll now go through results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, full year sales grew 2%, while Q4 sales grew 3%, reflecting growth in all three businesses. Our Professional Products business grew sales strongly in FY 2019 wrapping up the year with a double-digit sales growth in Q4. We've introduced a number of innovation platforms in this business over time and they continue to build momentum as we keep expanding distribution in the institutional channel. For example the Clorox Healthcare hydrogen peroxide line which launched in FY 2013; and Clorox Healthcare Fuzion, an FY 2017 innovation both have strong double-digit growth -- double-digit volume growth for the year. In Home Care, sales grew both in Q4 and for the full year. Q4 sales were up behind broad-based volume growth including record quarterly shipments of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes. While early, we're encouraged by the improvement we're seeing in wipes after beginning to address some of the short-term competitive headwinds we discussed in Q3. We'll continue to sharpen our consumer value equation in FY 2020 with an eye on long-term profitable growth for the category and for the brand. We're looking forward to sharing with you an exciting innovation in wipes this fall at our Analyst Day. Lastly, within the Cleaning segment. Our Laundry business sales were up for the quarter and about flat for the full year. We're excited to share that we'll be doing another round of compaction starting in FY 2020 which will drive category growth, while at the same time reducing overall environmental footprint for Clorox Liquid Bleach. While we're pleased with the results we're seeing in three of our four segments this quarter, results in Household were disappointing. Q4 sales were down 11% and full year sales were down 5%, driven mainly by declines in Charcoal and Glad. Turning around these businesses is as a top priority for us and we expect to see improvements in the back half of FY 2020. Now, let's go through the drivers business-by-business. In Charcoal, full year sales declined with Q4 sales down by double-digits due mainly to distribution losses and lower merchandising primarily at two large customers in mass and home hardware during the peak grilling periods in the quarter. We've seen retailers investing more space in support of alternative grilling fuels like lump and pellets, a growth area where we will begin to play in 2020. As a result we experienced lower merchandising support and loss some distribution while competitors have gained. These results are disappointing and we need to launch innovation that allows us to participate in these growing alternative grilling fuel segments and better differentiate Kingsford from competitors. We're working on a stronger 2020 season plan that will include new Kingsford pellets, product improvement across our base Kingsford product, Charcoal, and robust marketing support that will continue to focus on growing household penetration. While we expect the front half of the fiscal to be challenged we believe we'll turn we returned the business to growth in the back half of the fiscal based on the strength of the Kingsford brand, and our expectation that we will significantly improve our business plans for consumers and for retailers. In our Bags and Wraps business, sales were down for the fiscal year with a double-digit decline in Q4. Sales and share declines continued to be driven mainly by wider price gaps as well as distribution losses in select portions of the portfolio, which we've discussed last quarter. In Q3, we began increasing our trade investments to narrow these price gaps, and while it's early, we're starting to see green shoots in select areas where we've seen improvements and shares. Starting this Q1, we're implementing incremental trade investments that will fully close the remaining price gap and that should lead to further improvements on the business. In fiscal year 2020, we're also planning to launch various new products in the fast-growing scented trash bag segment, where Glad has commending equity over competitors. We expect to return to growth by the back half of fiscal year after we cycled through the impact of distribution losses. Longer-term, we continue to feel good about the value creation potential of this business. Our confidence comes from our dedication and significant investment in differentiated consumer and technology-led innovation. For perspective, we filed about 70 patents in the past five years, while our closest branded competitors -- competitor had none. We believe these type of investments will continue to drive long-term profitable growth for the brand and for the category. Turning to RenewLife. Sales were down by double-digits for Q4 and for the year. As we mentioned last quarter, we remain focused on restoring growth in this business and have confidence in the probiotic category and in our ability to differentiate our brand from competition by emphasizing our product efficacy. A continued bright spot in Household segment is our Cat Litter business, where Q4 sales were up on top of double-digit growth in the year ago period mainly due to the benefits of pricing. For the full year, sales were up by double-digits behind additional investment and Fresh Step Clean Paws innovation platform, which offered two new product option in the fiscal year, Mediterranean Lavender scent and unscented. In our Lifestyle segment, sales for the quarter were flat, while sales for the full year were up 17%, primarily reflecting the benefit of Nutranext acquisition. Burt's Bees had a very strong quarter of sales growth behind a record quarterly shipment in lip care and face care and sales were up for the full year as well. Successful innovation in these categories including overnight lips cloves, lip oil and sensitive skin care product continues to drive share growth for the brand. The business has another strong pipeline of innovation plan for FY 2020, including our recently launched lip butters, which offer a trade-up from traditional of lip balms with an experiential form flavor and texture as well as on-trend botanical blend flavors that are relevant to younger consumers. We'll have more to share with you on this in October. As we mark the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of Nutranext, sales were up for the quarter driven by strong growth in our strategic brands, which represents about 80% of the portfolio. We continue to be pleased with the progress we've made on this business, including the integration and of high expectation for FY 2020. Food sales were flat for the quarter, but up for the year. Q4 results reflect continued strength in bottled Hidden Valley dressing offset by lower shipments in Dry Hidden Valley products, which had double-digit growth in the year ago quarter. Ready-to-eat dips are off to a good start with early indications that the innovation is expanding usage occasions for the brand. Overall, the brand remains healthy and enjoyed its 18th consecutive quarter of share growth. Wrapping up the Lifestyle segment. Brita sales were down for the quarter, while being up for the full year. The Q4 sales decline was driven by timing of trade spending. This benefited Q3 sales, which were up by high single-digits, while drawing from this quarter. Importantly, this business is healthy as reflected by a solid and consistent volume growth in all four quarters of FY 2019. Consumption has continued to grow for eight consecutive quarters, and we're pleased to see our tracked channel market share up nearly one point in the last 13 weeks. We're also excited by the strong start of our bottle innovation, which was supported to increase demand spending. Finally, turning to International. Sales decreased 4% in Q4, driven by about 15 points of unfavorable foreign currency impact primarily in Argentina, which were partially offset by the benefits of price increases and volume growth. Europe and China both recorded double-digit volume growth for the quarter behind the strong performance of Cat Litter and Burt's Bees. Sales were down 6% for the full year, reflecting 15 points of headwinds from foreign currency impact. At the same time, we're pleased to see solid sales growth in a number of markets. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss our Q4 and fiscal year financial performance as well as outlook for fiscal year 2020. Kevin Jacobsen : Thank you, Lisah, and thank you everyone for joining us today. Overall results were mixed in fiscal year 2019, reflecting a strong start in the first half followed by more mixed results in the third and fourth quarters, primarily behind challenges in select categories. At the same time, I'm pleased with the progress we've made rebuilding gross margin allowing us to invest more in our brands and technology transformation to support long-term profitable growth. Starting with our fourth quarter results, sales decreased 4% reflecting a negative three point impact from lower volume and two points of negative impact from unfavorable foreign currencies, partially offset by the benefit of price increases net of trade spending. It's important to note that the three point volume decline in the quarter was driven by our Charcoal business and to a lesser extent our Glad business. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 45.1%, an increase of 110 basis points compared to 44% in the year ago quarter. Fourth quarter gross margin included 220 basis points of benefit from pricing and 150 basis points from cost savings, partially offset by 150 basis points of increased trade spending and 90 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were essentially flat versus the year ago quarter. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at about 10% with spending for our U.S. retail business coming in at about 11% for the second straight quarter. Our effective tax rate was about 17% versus about 29% in the year ago quarter, primarily driven by the benefit of U.S. tax reform. Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.88 versus $1.66 in the year ago quarter an increase of 13%. Now, I'll turn to our results for the full fiscal year. Sales grew 1% reflecting three points of net benefit from the Nutranext acquisition and Aplicare divestiture offset by a negative three-point impact from unfavorable foreign currencies. Fiscal year sales also include the benefit of price increases net of trade spending. Gross margin for the fiscal year came in at 43.9% versus 43.7% in fiscal year 2018 an increase of 20 basis points. Fiscal year gross margin results include the benefits of 190 basis points of pricing and 150 basis points of cost savings, partially offset by 190 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs and 60 basis points of unfavorable commodities. In fiscal year 2019, we delivered more than $120 million in cost savings hitting 12 consecutive years of generating more than $100 million in annual cost savings. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for the full fiscal year were essentially flat versus year ago as ongoing investments and the Nutranext acquisition were offset by progress from our ongoing productivity initiatives as well as lower incentive compensation accruals consistent with our performance-based compensation philosophy. Advertising and sales promotion spending as a percentage of sales for fiscal year 2019 increased to about 10% versus about 9% year ago, with U.S. Retail spending at about 11% for the fiscal year. For the full fiscal year, our effective tax rate was about 20% compared to the year ago rate of about 22%, primarily reflecting the benefit of U.S. tax reform. Net of all these factors, our fiscal year diluted EPS from continuing operations was $6.32 compared with $6.26 in fiscal year 2018, an increase of 1% on top of a 17% increase in fiscal year 2018. Turning to cash flow for the fiscal year. Net cash provided by continuing operations in fiscal year 2019 came in at $992 million versus $976 million in the prior year. Our track record of generating strong cash flow and maintaining a healthy balance sheet enables us to continue to invest in the long-term health of our business and return excess cash to our shareholders. In fiscal year 2019, we increased our dividend by 10% on top of a 14% increase year ago, which continues our long history of increasing our dividend. In addition, as part of our ongoing commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, we returned $328 million as part of our open-market share repurchase program. At the end of the fiscal year 2019, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.1 which is at the low end of our target range of two to 2.5 times. Now, I'll turn to our fiscal year 2020 outlook. We expect fiscal year sales to be in the range of flat to 2% reflecting 1% to 3% organic sales growth, primarily driven by innovation partially offset by about one point of negative impact from foreign currency headwinds. It's important to note that we anticipate first half sales to be at the low end of our range with our assumption for first quarter sales to be down as we work to restore growth on our Glad and Charcoal businesses. For the second half of the fiscal year, we anticipate sales to be at the higher end of our range, consistent with our expectation for these two businesses to return to growth in the back half of the fiscal year. Turning to gross margin, we expect fiscal year gross margin to be about flat to down slightly, reflecting our expectation for flat gross margin prior to additional supply chain investments we are making to drive long-term value creation. One great example is, our first half investment to support the initial rollout of Clorox Liquid Bleach Compaction in the spring of 2020, offering improved consumer experience and meaningful sustainability benefits. We look forward to the value the Bleach Compaction will bring to the category. We expect fiscal year advertising and sales promotion investment levels to be at about 10% of sales. Selling and administrative expenses are expected to come in, at about 14% of sales, reflecting ongoing acquisition-related investments as well as technology transformation investments to support long-term growth and cost savings. In addition, we anticipate more normalized levels of performance-based incentive compensation. We expect fiscal year EBIT margin to be about flat to down slightly, based on our expectations for fiscal year gross margin. Importantly, we believe we are taking the necessary actions to expand EBIT margin in the back half of the fiscal year, at a level more in line with our long-term financial targets of 25 to 50 basis points. Our outlook also includes the ongoing benefits of U.S. tax reform, with the assumption that our fiscal year tax rate will be in the range of 22% to 23%. This includes the ongoing benefits of U.S. tax reform, partially offset by our expectation for lower excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Net of all of these factors, fiscal year 2020 diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $6.30 to $6.50. Consistent with our anticipated fiscal year sales progression, we expect diluted EPS to be more muted in the first half as we work through challenges on our Glad and Charcoal business and stronger in the second half. In closing, I'd like to reinforce that I believe we are taking the right actions to address the short-term challenges we're facing in key categories, while making sure we continue to invest in the long-term health of our business. Last quarter, we discussed the challenges we are facing on our Glad and Wipes businesses. And while there's more work to be done on Glad, we're certainly pleased with the progress with Wipes. We delivered record quarterly shipments in the quarter on top of record shipments in the year ago period. In addition, although we expected to face some bumpiness in parts of our portfolio, we believe the cost justified pricing was a right decision. Pricing and strong cost savings enabled us to address the ongoing inflationary environment we have been operating in over the last three years, while also enabling us to continue investing behind our brands and categories in support of long-term value creation. Moving forward, we're addressing Glad and Charcoal head-on while remaining focused on profitable growth. We will continue to invest strongly in our brands, including innovation, which will help us continue to deliver superior consumer value. We will continue to lean into our cost savings program and productivity initiatives to create fuel for growth. Additionally, we will continue to drive our Go Lean strategy in International. We're pleased with the businesses' strong operational progress in the face of ongoing currency inflation. And finally, I'd like to make sure that it's clear that after we work through the challenges we're facing in a couple of our businesses, Clorox will be in a position to deliver result that are more in line with our long-term financial goals. And with that, I'll turn it over to Benno. Benno Dorer : Hello, everyone, and thank you, Kevin. Here are my three key messages for you today : first, as we discussed fiscal year 2019 was mixed, which was reflected in our back half results. We're currently facing persistent challenges in Charcoal and Glad, that impacted our top line results in the back half and full fiscal year of 2019. We will work to significantly strengthen our Charcoal business plans as well as address the pricing-related issues and drive innovation on Glad. We anticipate these businesses will return to growth in the back half of fiscal year 2020. At the same time, I feel good about the strength in other parts of our portfolio with strong fiscal year sales growth in a number of businesses. We delivered broad-based growth across Home Care, our largest SBU with Clorox Disinfecting Wipes to returning to growth in the fourth quarter. We also delivered sales growth in our Professional Products business, double-digit sales growth in Litter, strong sales growth in Burt's Bees as well as sales increases in Food and Brita. I also feel good about our innovation program. It continues to drive consumer value that is superior through differentiation in our products and brands with the introduction of consumer meaningful innovations in fiscal year 2019, including Hidden Valley Ready-to-Eat Dips, Brita Filtering Water Bottles and several new Burt's Bees lip and face care products. We're also pleased to see continued momentum behind our Clorox Scentiva and Fresh Step Clean Paws platforms. I continue to be pleased with the Nutranext acquisition, which delivered robust growth in the fourth quarter and contributed strongly to total company fiscal year sales behind an integration that remains on track. I'm also pleased with our strong progress in our International business. In the face of significant FX headwinds, our Go Lean strategy has delivered six consecutive quarters of profit growth. We're also seeing strong momentum behind growth platforms in several regions. E-commerce continued to be an increasingly meaningful growth engine for the company and now represents about 8% of total company sales. And finally, we expanded gross margin, which was the key to creating fuel for brand growth in fiscal year 2019. My second message is that our fiscal year 2020 outlook represents an appropriate plan reflecting the balance of addressing the shorter-term challenges on Charcoal and Glad, as well as our plans to continue leaning into driving long-term profitable growth. I'd like to reinforce what Kevin said about pricing and that is, notwithstanding the temporary bumpiness we had anticipated, we firmly believe cost-justified pricing was the right decision for the long term. Pricing helped address the ongoing inflationary environment we've been facing and supported continued investment in long-term brands and category growth. An immediate priority for us certainly is getting Charcoal and Glad back on track. As I mentioned, based on our expectations to deliver stronger business plans for Charcoal and move past the issues post pricing on Glad, we anticipate these two businesses to return to growth in the second half. That all said, we will remain principled in our commitment to long-term profitable growth and will continue to pursue strategic investments that will lay the groundwork for the future of the company. As Kevin mentioned, we're investing in the first half of the fiscal year to support the initial launch of Clorox Liquid Bleach Compaction in the spring of 2020, which we're very excited about. And, of course, we'll be relentless in building brands that consumers love and lean into demand-building investments including increased advertising dollars at about 10% of sales. Above all, innovation remains a powerful lever for us as it's the force behind long-term profitable growth. We're pleased that 2020 will bring another robust pipeline of innovation, led by the compaction of Clorox Liquid Bleach, innovation on Clorox Wipes and new products and other businesses, including several innovations on Glad and in Burt's Bees Lip and Face Care. We will drive trial and awareness on these new products while also continuing to invest behind several of the innovation platforms we've already introduced, such as Clorox Scentiva, Fresh Step Clean Paws, Brita Filtering Water Bottles and Hidden Valley Ready-to-Eat Dips, which all have meaningful upside potential. Finally, the third message I'll share with you today is that we're confident in the strategic path we are laying out to continue Clorox' track record of delivering long-term shareholder value. Our new strategy is supported by a proven business model of leading brands in attractive midsize categories, strong operational execution based on innovation and an unwavering commitment to good growth, growth that's profitable, sustainable and responsible. We have a strong global portfolio with the majority of global sales made up of number one and number two brands. We're expanding this portfolio further into health and wellness with our Nutranext acquisition, which is currently expected to deliver double-digit sales growth in fiscal year 2020. We're confident that robust innovation program will continue to deliver superior consumer value by differentiating our products and brands. Building on our 2020 strategy, which delivered strong shareholder return, we're confident our new strategy will continue to guide us in delivering strong cost savings, generating strong cash flows, leading to top-tier ROIC and maintaining a healthy balance sheet. We remain committed to putting our strong cash flow to work, by investing in the long-term health of our business and rewarding our shareholders. And finally we'll continue our focus on growing the right way, by living our values and driving sustainability in our products and operations. We'll continue to be a mission-driven business with the goal to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. And with that, operator, you may now open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Dorer. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Hey, thanks. So, I think, you've been pretty clear about the challenges that you face in wipes and Charcoal. But how should we think about the rest of the business in fiscal 2020, because there is roughly a 300 basis point spread between the midpoint of your stated long-term goal of 3% to 5% growth and this year's flat to 2% outlook? And based on what we've heard from others, just a broader backdrop for CPG demand seems pretty favorable. So I'd like to assume the rest of the portfolio, ex-Glad and ex-Charcoal would be performing in line with at least the low end to mid-range of that long-term outlook. But if you're expecting both Glad and Charcoal to return to growth in the back half, it seems to imply the other 80% of the portfolio might also end up below even at 3% levels. So could you just help me with that and frame for me how you think that portfolio is shaping up health-wise versus the long term? Kevin Jacobsen : Hey, Steve. Good morning. This is Kevin and I appreciate the question. And let me give you a perspective on how we're feeling about the portfolio broadly, separating the businesses, as we've talk about, that have been more challenge Glad and coal. As you heard in our prepared remarks, our expectations when we think about fiscal year 2020 is, those two businesses will be a drag on our performance in the front half or we work to get them back on track. But if I set those aside, we feel very good broadly about the balance of our portfolio. If you look at Cleaning, Lifestyle and International, all performing well over fiscal year 2019. And when I look at fiscal year 2020 our expectation, specifically in the U.S. is that, we'll be generating top-line growth consistent with our long-term growth algorithm. As you know it's 2% to 4% in the U.S. And our expectation is we're going to be back in that range in the back half of the year as we get coal and Glad back on track. Steve Powers : Okay. So did -- any drag versus the long-term algorithm ex-Glad, ex-Charcoal is really just International and some of the macro factors. Is that fair? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. That's right. And for International, we've been targeting 5% to 7%. We've continued to be challenged by FX headwinds. That was particularly true in 2019 where we had about a 15-point headwind. I'd tell you as we look at 2020 we think it's going to be a slightly better environment, but we still think it's going to be a material headwind to our International business. On a currency neutral basis they are certainly growing within that 5% to 7% if not higher, but being held back by FX at this point. Steve Powers : Okay. Great. And then Kevin, why don't I get you talking? You gave some helpful phasing information for the -- on the top-line for the year. But could you talk to us through any phasing dynamics on the gross margin line or the advertising lines? And then I'll pass it on. Thanks. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. Maybe on advertising, I would say, typically we will spend the money based on when it's most advantageous for us. It tends to be a bit more loaded in the back half just based on the innovation cycle. I would expect to see something similar to that although I don't expect to see any big changes but maybe a little bit heavier on the back half. And then on gross margin gross margin I think will be fairly consistent across the year. The investments we're making will put a little bit of downward pressure on margin. As we mentioned we're investing in compaction. They will be launching in the spring. We've got another project we're not ready to talk about publicly, but will continue to invest in it and we'll talk about that at a future date. Steve Powers : Okay. Great. Thank you. Kevin Jacobsen : Thanks, Steve, Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS. Steve Strycula : Good afternoon. So first a more mechanical question and then more of a strategic question for Benno. So for Kevin on the repurchase activity is any repurchase activity be embedded in the fiscal 2020 outlook? And can you give us some kind of magnitude? And were you back in the market in the fourth quarter? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. Thanks, Steve. I can start with our repurchase program. If I just think broadly about fiscal year 2019, we're quite pleased. We returned about $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2019. That's a combination of both dividend and share repurchases. That's up about 60% versus fiscal year 2018 as you've seen us lean into the dividend over the last couple of increases. That also includes on our share repurchase program, we have now executed about $425 million against my $2 billion authorization so about 20% of the authorization, which also included about $250 million in Q4. As I look forward, as we've talked before this is not an ASR so I do not have a defined number of shares I'm going to buy. We've got an internal program we manage. What I'd tell you is I would have you believe that within the outlook we provide there may be some level of share repurchases. I'm not going to provide a forecast on it. But to extent, it materially changes one way or the another -- I'd certainly update you. But for now you should assume it's embedded within our EPS outlook range. Steve Strycula : Okay. And then Benno just wanted to understand strategically how should we think about compaction phasing through the business particularly as it launches in the spring? And then what has been the feedback in your conversations with retailers as to -- that gives you confidence that some of those businesses can accelerate in the back half of next year? Benno Dorer : Yes. So Bleach Compaction -- Steve will start in quarter three. And typically if you recall our progress on compaction over the last few times we did it we've got some experience on this the last time we did it was 2013. It takes several quarters so we'd expect to be through all of this in several stages early fiscal year 2021. So feel good about that project. Clearly as we think about our coal and Glad -- so maybe focus your question on coal. Coal the issue is really that we're out of sync with two large customers. And we have to get back in sync strategically with those two large customers. We also need better demand-building plans. Obviously, results are disappointing there as Lisah said. And we owe our customers and consumers better plans with the right innovation. And as Lisah said, we will have product improvements as well as new Kingsford pellets in market for the next grilling season. We'll have continued strong marketing support focused on household penetration and brand value and excitement. And again, we need to have the right merchandising plans with all retailers consistently. And we clearly didn't succeed with that in Q4. So that's the work ahead. That's work that our company has a strong track record of. We feel like we know what the opportunity is on this business as well as on Glad. And we have to get back to doing what we do best. Steve Strycula : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : All right. Thank you. I actually have a big-picture question on your strategy. The strategy you guys just discussed and know what you're going to be unveiling further at your October Analyst Day doesn't necessarily sound like a major change from your current strategy. But I guess you have been thinking about and looking back at just subpar results in FY 2019 and a pretty weak outlook for FY 2020, I'm wondering if you guys think you might need to make more radical changes either in your strategy or possibly in the composition of your portfolio. I guess I'm really trying to understand what gives you the confidence that some of the changes you're making will result in the improvements in the second half. Benno Dorer : Yes. Thanks Bonnie. So, we don't need that -- we don't think that that's needed, so no major change in strategy. If we think about the issues, again, they're largely contained to two businesses. And again if I think about Charcoal, we're mostly off with two customers. And Glad is really tied to post-pricing issues where we've clearly seen widened price gaps which we're addressing and we also saw some distribution bumpiness probably across the portfolio which we can also trace back to pricing. And again we have reaffirmed that pricing is really necessary and we'll stand by that. So, feeling good about the rest of the portfolio. Frankly, as Kevin said, it's generally solid. We'll cycle through in the post pricing bumpiness. We think we can address the Glad and Charcoal issues. And then we really think we have robust plans for fiscal year 2020 and beyond. Strong advertising sales promotion that's still relevant. We have brands that consumers love. We have our consumer value propositions and measure continued to be positive. We have robust innovation plans. We're leaning to cost savings. And we will continue to deliver strong cash flow and then put that to work for our shareholders. We think all of the fundamentals that have worked so well for our shareholders with our company strategically for a long period of time continue to remain in place and we're excited to update you on where we're going in October in New York. But you should expect us to lean into components that will make a difference to consumers, to customers, and to shareholders. But what you cannot expect is the departure from a strategic path that's worked for the company for a very long time. Bonnie Herzog : Okay. Honestly that's really helpful. And if I may I wanted to circle back to something you touched on and maybe drill down a little bit further on the higher trade promo spending and whether it's working in Household or specifically in bags. And should we assume that you're going to need to pull a little bit further on that lever as you touched on the gap from they're at which is further implied in your guidance? And then trying to think about how much do you have to pull there and whether or not that will impact work. And then as we think about Charcoal and you touched on this, but should we also think about the promo lever being pulled in that category too for your turnaround, or is that just more dependent on some of the merchandising in innovation you mentioned? Benno Dorer : Yes. Charcoal first. So, right merchandising, right innovation, right demand plans that's really the answer here. On Glad if you think about what we did in Q4, we did up our trade investments to narrow the price gaps. That led to sequential improvements and we're clearly seeing green shoots. If you look at for instance the grocery channel where that was implemented first, shares have improved and now -- are now about flat. But I think we would say that the lien interest trade spend wasn't enough which is why in Q1 we're planning for additional trade spend that will fully close the widened gaps that we experienced post pricing. So, that's working. But perhaps the progress on this has been overshadowed by distribution losses tied to bumpiness that we have explained. And then frankly it has been a little worse than we had anticipated in Q4 and has worsened and overshadowed the progress through the trade investments. So, feel good about the added trade investments that we're putting in place in Q1. And then to make full progress in the back half what's needed is to cycle through those distribution losses and to bring innovation back. And as Lisah said earlier, we have several initiatives planned for the back half. And with all those plans combined, we expect a return to growth and we feel pretty good about the prospects of that. Bonnie Herzog : All right. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Hi, good morning. Thank you. So, I just want to go back to distribution just a follow-up. And I appreciate Benno your commentary about Charcoal execution in two other customers. So, I think like you know what's happening there. And I get that obviously you may not you also said that you don't expect the shelf to flag the distribution losses that you've had until the next calendar year -- early calendar year, right? So the second half of fiscal. So, I'm just trying to understand what makes you confident that these two retailers will put you back on shelf and that your value proposition will be more compelling in the second half of fiscal 2020 than what you have in place right now? And are you planning to or price rollbacks then for -- I mean probably -- Charcoal is probably not the case but for Glad? And then a separate question would be on supplements on Lifestyle. I know you feel confident about Nutranext that it checks the boxes on collagen and protein trends. But you mentioned that you may decide in the last quarter conference call to a different question that I post to you that you may decide to increase investments in RenewLife in fiscal 2020. Is that a possibility now or not yet? Thank you. Benno Dorer : Yes. So, a lot in there Andrea. Let me try to unpack this a little bit. So on Glad, as I just said, we will add more trade promotion in the first quarter of this fiscal year to fully close the gap. What makes me confident on coal that we are going to be more strategically aligned with the two retailers were clearly -- we need to do better. That's up on -- that's up to us. I feel like the combination of our plans with product improvements with new line extensions and pellets, with stronger marketing support and very collaborates -- collaborative talks with both retailers that are going on right now and better plans we will earn their confidence back. It's something that we have a strong track record of and it's something that we need to get back to. Regarding your question on vitamins, minerals and supplements, clearly, feel good about Nutranext as is evidenced by the progress throughout fiscal year 2019 and the expected double-digit growth in fiscal year 2020. RenewLife is clearly still lagging behind. Fiscal year 2019 was a disappointing fiscal year on that business and Q4 was no exception. For perspective, RenewLife represents a little over 1% of sales. So perhaps in terms of materiality, it's less of a factor here, but we're also working on better plans. We remain excited about the long-term potential in digestive wellness. We have a strong brand. We have strong capabilities in this category. The process will take time, but feel good about the long-term prospect on RenewLife too. Andrea Teixeira : Very helpful. Thank you, Benno. Operator : Next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Great. Thanks. Wanted to talk a little bit about tracked versus the untracked. You talked about some of the shelf space losses that you've seen in the mass and the home retailer. But it's kind of surprising to see that the spread between tracked and untracked widened as dramatically as it did this quarter and also in a different direction than usual. So is it fair to assume that there were disproportionate losses in club and online? If so can you kind of give us a little bit more color into the channels? And then, I mean, you -- is there like stuff that came that you would -- that was up for bid and the margin profile just didn't quite meet your standards. Benno Dorer : Yeah. Thanks Olivia. So, clearly as I would unpack this if you think about Q4 volume versus year ago the drag really is entirely at Kingsford and Glad. And within those two businesses, frankly, the majority of the drag is Kingsford. And then if you then think about the Kingsford business as we said, we're -- the issues were with two major customers. And one of them is untracked right in the home hardware channel and that -- this is a big quarter for Kingsford and this is a big customer. So the Q4 impact of that was unusual and significant. And I would point you to that single retailer in a very big business in a very big quarter to account for much of the issue. Olivia Tong : And then haven't talked a ton about wipes. But last quarter you sounded pretty down deep and cautious about where you are in the Disinfecting Wipes lifecycle. But then this quarter you reported record quarterly shipments of the wipes. So can you talk a little bit about what's the change there and the dynamics that kind of led to such a snapback in the underlying trends of course excluding the impact of cold and flu last quarter? Thank you. Benno Dorer : Yeah. So positive about the progress on wipes, clearly, a competitive category still. But last quarter we talked to you about putting trade spend in place to counter what is an elevated competitive activity on the promotional side. We returned to growth this last quarter on top of a very strong quarter in the previous fiscal year. And we were able to make the trade spend increase begin to work. And now for fiscal year 2020, we continue to feel good about this business. We expect this trade investment to continue to work. And importantly, at the Analyst Day, we'll share with you significant innovation both on the base as well as with the new product that we're very excited about. So this is a stronghold for our company. It's a growth engine for our company and we expect that to continue. Olivia Tong : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. So I wanted to focus on pricing for a minute. If we go back a year ago when price increases were first being implemented in the household products industry, I think at least from my perspective we heard a very confident tone from you guys more so than other companies and basically that you've earned pricing power with the increase in new product superiority at the consumer level. If we fast forward to today, pricing has pretty much gone through almost across the board at most of your competitors and you guys had a couple of categories where you've had price gap issues in terms of both bags and wipes and a better response. So I'd just be curious to get a bit of postmortem on if anything has changed from your perspective in terms of the way you manage pricing what you sort of learned from those issues? And I guess specifically as you look at the price gaps is sort of managing the price gaps versus peers a greater priority given they appeared to be willing to use that pricing lever? Thanks. Benno Dorer : Yes Dara. So like we said in our earlier remarks we feel good about pricing. It was cost justified is necessary to protect long-term margin also to protect the strong investments that we're making in our brands. All of them are in market now. And I would say generally in line with expectations excluding Glad and Kingsford, I would say. It's just too early. The key indicators -- consumer indicators are strong. If I think about the consumer value measure and as you know that's a measure that we care about a lot, that's unchanged post pricing and the majority of our brands continue to be perceived by consumers as delivering superior value and that's very positive and important to us. The categories have improved. Two years ago before we started any pricing activity our categories were flattish for the total company. Now if you think about the last 52 weeks they're up north of 2 points, up versus year ago. That's a dramatic difference and is very consistent with past experience and expectations. So I would say excluding Glad inline with expectations, clearly the bumpiness that we had anticipated which leads generally to lower merchandising and distribution losses are there. We're seeing them. We're addressing them. But they're temporary. But generally the good news is that pricing has been accepted, has been accepted as part of the industry where we perhaps somewhat disproportionately affected by distribution losses given that we went out with price increases as you recall Dara early and confidently. That's quite possible, but that doesn't change our conclusion that pricing overall was necessary and good. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. That's helpful. And then looking at a bunch of your peers in the U.S. we've seen top line momentum come back to a number of names with reinvestment behind the business. It sounds like a lot of the European household products peers are also choosing to do some margin resets and reinvestments. I guess just as we think about your business have you considered a larger reinvestment back into ad spend on what you've guided to this year? Why wouldn't that make sense here? I get that a lot of those companies don't directly compete against you. But there seem to be a number of players that are perceiving like higher spending is working to drive their business in the industry. So any thoughts there would be helpful? Thanks. Benno Dorer : Yes Dara. We always consider how much money to spend and the -- about 10% continues to be the right number. Remember that's up already from previous years. Also the spending in absolute this year will be up and comes on the back of higher ROIs as measured by our own analytic insights. So we're confident with the 10% as the right level. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : Thanks, good afternoon everybody. Two questions, I guess, first we've spoken quite a bit about distribution. Can you give us some context on what the impact was from distribution losses on your overall top line? And then when we're thinking -- as we're thinking about next year can you give some context on the impact of what generally seems to be lower commodity cost on your gross margins? Thanks. Kevin Jacobsen : Thanks Kaumil. It's Kevin. I'll - let me take the two questions about commodities and distribution. On the commodity question in terms of the impact of the topline, I would tell you -- or excuse me distribution, we don't break that out. So I think we share the key drivers in terms of volume and price mix, but don't break out the impact to distribution loss. What I would tell you on commodities in terms of our expectations, if you recall in fiscal year 2019 there's a pretty significant headwind both commodities and logistics about 150 basis points. As we look forward in fiscal year 2020 and our ingoing assumption to the year is a much milder commodity environment, I expect it to be down in the front half and up slightly in the back half, but pretty benign overall. Having said that I do expect logistics to continue to be a headwind in fiscal year 2020, both transportation rates I anticipate will still be inflationary to a lesser degree than what we experienced in 2019, but still inflationary. And then we continue to see inflation in logistics particularly in warehousing as we can use the warehouses being built to support fast delivery and that's putting pressure on wages. But overall, I would expect that somewhere in the 50 to 100 bp headwind which is much less that we experienced in 2019. Kaumil Gajrawala : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Excellent. Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here and good afternoon to you. I want to drill a little bit deeper into two other businesses both the multipurpose liquid cleaners and bleach if we could. First, on bleach it's -- the data the measured data and tracked channels has softened of late with the private label picking up and your business spotting and share on axillary and distribution losses. Can you give us any context of what you're seeing across all channels and what you think may be driving that? And then still on the topic of bleach, going back to 2013 the last compaction initiative -- and I'm really stretching my memory here. But if my memory does serve me correct, it created a lot of market share volatility for you I believe as private label was slow to follow and there was a perception a value perception. It was private label sitting next to you at much bigger bottles that really weighed on share and was volatile for performance for a while. A, is my memory correct there? And B, any reason it would be different this time? Benno Dorer : Yes, in gust in general I'm quite pleased with Laundry. Laundry had a solid year Jason. And actually most recently if you think about our bleach business we gained share right? But typically what does happen is that share gains tend to over time be a little bit of a zero-sum game. And you win some and you lose some. And there's always volatility. But in general shares in the category have been over for long period of time about flat. And the value that we've been driving on this business comes from expansion of the category and from trade-up. And in the future, we don't expect to change from that strategy. Bleach Compaction feeds into that. Most of all what Bleach Compaction has always done is trade consumers up to larger sizes and with that comes a quite significant category increase. So if you think about the benefit on -- of compaction for the company, the last time in 2013 it was actually higher sales mostly driven by category growth. And then second of course there's a margin component as well which at the time was rather significant. So given that there is a transition over for sure two quarters and of course we can't speak to competition following and what their specific timings are that always creates some volatility. But the net effect as a result of category increases and margin improvements has been very positive. And of course it's a good investment also for sustainability reasons and one that retailers are very excited about leads to better shelf holding power, fewer out-of-stocks in the category and this is a category that's always been somewhat affected by out-of-stocks. So it is a very good initiative that will create a lot of value for the company, but also for retailers and certainly for the planet. Jason English : Okay. So long term generally good. But historically could be turbulent maybe turbulent this time around for a short duration before it gets better. Benno Dorer : Yes. So turbulent is a strong word Jason. I don't know that I would go all the way there. Certainly there will be quarter-on-quarter volatility. But I do not recall any turbulence on the business and would not expect that. Jason English : Okay. And on the liquid cleaners side which is a pretty chunky-sized business for you guys. Year two the Nielsen datas looked soft and I know it varies by cohort or which subsegment we look into it. But in general, there's been a fair amount of -- fairly sizable share losses that we can see on the tracked channel and also here too fairly sizable distribution declines. It looks problematic in the data but you're not talking about it. So is it indeed sort of problematic, or is it just the lens we're looking through? Benno Dorer : It's always temporary back and forth. In Home Care generally we feel good about Home Care. There's many segments that are growing and there's always some that aren't growing. Home Care has a lot of different segments and you're picking one. We feel -- obviously it feels good about our Home Care business. It's our largest SBU, had a strong fiscal year 2019 had a strong quarter. Certainly, as a result of pricing you'll see some bumpiness there too which is temporary. But as I think about Home Care including multipurpose liquid cleaners, I feel good about that business and our plans forward. Jason English : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Hey, good afternoon everyone. A couple for me. One on Kingsford and then I have a follow-up on bleach. So Benno, on Kingsford, you talked about getting into pellets and lump charcoal for some time. And naturally it would seem to make sense to extend the Kingsford brand in the category. But a few questions here. With the benefit of hindsight what do you think the company did not react earlier to the trend away from traditional Charcoal? As you plan to extend the brand into these new forms what's your level of confidence in these new product forms that you'll indeed have success and be able to pick up some share? You talked Benno about the necessity to regain retailer confidence. How should we be thinking about that level of uncertainty here that's embedded in the outlook? And then at a higher level here how are you thinking about the growth rate for Kingsford longer term? Benno Dorer : Yes. So, thanks Kevin. First of all, let me maybe start with the last question. So grilling fuels is an attractive category. It's very much on trend. And if you think about the category growth rates including those alternative grilling fuels like lump and pellets actually very strong strongly growing category, we're not benefiting from it. But historically we have and we have to get back to that. Would I have liked for us to be in pellets and lump by now? Absolutely. But what we're focused on now is to get into these markets with propositions that are truly differentiated and that make a difference to the category and adds to the category and to the existing offerings. And admittedly that takes time and sometimes taking time leads to better outcomes. And while like I said I would like to be in there by now we're now focused on looking forward and putting better plans in place for calendar year 2020. Like I said earlier, the problem is largely contained to two large customers. If we drill into say the top 10 customers, there are several customers where we're actually doing quite well. And we have plans that we put in place have been well-received and are working. We got to do better with those two large customers. They are important customers for us. We have a strong track record of success with them and we have to get back to that. Kevin Grundy : Okay. All right, thanks, Benno. I'll leave the Kingsford topic there. A quick follow-up, maybe this is for Kevin on bleach and the benefit of compaction. I don't know if you specified exactly the degree of compaction. But you guys did disclose in the past that was 500 basis points of margin improvement. Do you care to put a number on, what the benefit will be to the Clorox Bleach business for this round of compaction? And then, I can pass it on. Thank you. Kevin Jacobsen : Thanks, Kevin. Yeah, I would tell you. We're not disclosing the impact of bleach. What I would tell you, we feel very good about it in terms of creating long-term value to the company. This is another great program for us. But in terms of the specifics of the value, we won't disclose that. Kevin Grundy : Okay. Thank you, guys. Good luck. Kevin Jacobsen : Thanks, Kevin. Lisah Burhan : We'll take one last question. Operator : We have a question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hi, guys. Thanks. I think I have a couple questions. One is, do you want to get a better sense of where the confidence is coming from, on the non-Kingsford, non-Glad businesses. And that the issues you've seen there won't spread? And look I get that we always a tracked channels as less important. Tracked channel isn't that big as a business. We have also some other channels. But it's been even just recently a pretty good leading indicator of some of your issues, perhaps a little bit of a longer lag, but clearly its odd show -- the issue show up in Kingsford in the tracked channel data and Glad as well. And so if you permit me to continue with that, lens, the tracked channels actually matter. One of the biggest indicator has been market share losses and I'm just looking at the data. Again, it's a couple of months now. But cleaning broadly, to spray cleaners, to losing share, dressing looks like it's losing share its clearly white as you said, Cat Litter, digestive supplement. You know, I could go on. And those look like they're losing market share. So I guess, I'm trying to get a sense of where your confidence comes, that you're not going to see a spread given the tracked channels remains -- some what a leading indicator at least that has been for the two businesses you had issues in so far Kingsford and Glad. Benno Dorer : Yeah, thanks, Ali. So clearly tracked channels matter, because they account for the majority of the business, as it does market share, so that up front. With exception of this quarter, which again was overshadowed by Charcoal, I think we have commented in the past that, performance in non-tracked channels were stronger. We expect that to continue. It's also fair to say, that our market share have been somewhat under pressure and not as strong as they used to be. I think that is evident. And while that's, not something that we like. I'd also say that, what we expect about sales is to drive market share but also categories. So, we'd perhaps again go to a much stronger category, growth as a way to partially offset that. And doing a time of pricing and the bumpiness that we talked about, distributional losses and then in some cases lack of sufficient merchandising, I would put market share softness, firmly in the camp of temporary bumpiness post pricing. What makes me confident is that again if I think about the timing of trade spend on Brita aside that the three segments outside household are performing at minimum solidly with many, actually performing very strongly. And then I think about our plans for fiscal year 2020 based on strong advertising sales promotion, aggressive plans to defend our businesses through trade were needed in selective areas, robust innovation plans, solid categories, a healthy U.S. consumer, an improving business in International, all those things point to a pretty stable and positive outlook that we expect to shine through in the back half. Ali Dibadj : That's very helpful context. And just to push a little bit on that context. As we think about the first half versus back half, I don't like being so short-term oriented. But it does seem like if everything else is going okay and the confidence is still there and I get there's a little bit more Brita investments and you still got to do Kingsford and Glad, I get that. But I guess I'm still confused about why, number one, it's so extremely, it sounds like back half loaded, i.e., I'm reading into Glad, Kingsford might get worse before they get better in the next -- in the first half. And then two is, whether you're especially with the compaction that should help in the back half whether there's anything else that you're seeing that might actually be under pressure around the corner because with the confidence it would suggest maybe it should be better from a guidance perspective for 2020 than you've given us so far at least on the top line. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah Ali. This is Kevin. Maybe a couple of thoughts to think about front half, back half. As we've talked about the two businesses have been challenged. I would expect to see a sequential improvement from Glad. As we mentioned, we increased trade spending in Q4 and we start to see some improvements. We are increasing further to fully narrow that price gap back when it took pricing and I expect that to drive continuous improvement. Coal I think is going to have a challenged finish to what we call season year 2019 as we've talked about the work we have to do looking forward to season year 2020. So I expect that to be challenged in Q1 and then be stronger in the back half. And then maybe just a couple other things to think about is as we think about why we have confidence in the back half. Keep in mind, we're lapping a very weak cold and flu season from this year. We'll be lapping pricing at the back half of the year. The bulk of our pricing started early in 2019, so we'll be lapping most of that by the back half. The distribution losses as well will now won't be lapping. We're starting to build some of those back. And then finally, our plans on innovation tend to be more back half-loaded. And so when we look at all those drivers, it gives us quite a bit of confidence on our ability to accelerate the performance of the company in the back half of the year. Ali Dibadj : Okay, okay. I get the compares point certainly. Okay. Thanks very much. Kevin Jacobsen : Thanks Ali. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would now like to turn the program over to you. Benno Dorer : Yeah. Thank you all for joining us today and I look forward to seeing all of you hopefully at our Analyst Day in October. Thank you. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Clorox Company First Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call. Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. Lisah Burhan : Thanks, Sharon. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Happy Halloween. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, our Chairman and CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet. And a replay of the call will be available for seven days on our website thecloroxcompany.com. On today's call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA, organic sales growth and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliations with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available on our website as well as in our SEC filings. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release. Please also recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcome could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. I'll start by covering our top line commentary, discussing highlights in each of our segments. Kevin will then address our financial results as well as our outlook for the fiscal year 2020. Finally, Benno will offer his perspective and we'll close with Q&A. For the total company, Q1 sales decreased 4%. The results are on top of solid sales growth in the year ago period. Organic sales were down 2%. I'll now go through our results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, sales decreased 2% for the quarter. Our Professional Products business delivered strong sales growth, driven by a successful back-to-school campaign particularly in the e-commerce channel. We also continue to see strength and longevity of our innovation in this business, with platforms such as Clorox Hydrogen Peroxide and Clorox Fuzion, both disinfectants used in health care setting, delivering double-digit growth even four years after their initial launch. In Home Care, sales were down slightly with volume growth offset by unfavorable mix and increased performance bifurcation between tracked and non-tracked channels. Shipments of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes grew solidly for the quarter with growth in non-tracked channels, outpacing tracked channels by a wide margin. Our investments were fully implemented are working and helping grow the category. Our near-term focus is to strengthen our results consistently across all channels. Additionally, as highlighted in our IGNITE Strategy launch, we have a strong innovation plan based on bigger, stickier platforms, with Clorox Compostable Cleaning Wipes launching in late Q2. Our Scentiva platform continues to perform well with high single digit volume growth three years after its initial launch. Lastly, within the Cleaning segment, our Laundry business sales were down for the quarter, driven primarily by distribution losses of Clorox liquid bleach in select retailers coupled with increased competitive promotion. We're addressing this with innovation on multiple fronts, including launch of a full line of compacted bleach product in spring 2020. During the same period, we're also launching a sanitizing innovation platform, including a trigger, spray aerosol spray and a liquid laundry additive product, bringing the strong Clorox equity to the fast-growing sanitization segment. Turning to the Household segment, Q1 sales were down 14%, driven mainly by declines in Bags and Wraps and Charcoal. In Bags and Wraps, Q1 sales were down double digits, driven by the same factors we discussed previously, wider price gaps as well as distribution losses in select portions of the portfolio. Higher trade investments on Glad trash bags are now in place. We're seeing sequential improvements in volume as well as market share and we're focused on building on this momentum. As expected, Charcoal sales were down double digits this quarter, driven by lower shipments. The sales decline also reflected higher trade spending, part of an ongoing effort to reduce market inventory from a weak 2019 grilling season and to gear up a stronger 2020 grilling season. Building on a strong grilling category consumption and a normalized inventory level going into the upcoming grilling season, we'll be focused on executing our plan to turn this business around. In RenewLife, sales declined double digits due to category slowdown and persisting consumption headwinds. As part of our effort to return this business to growth, we're continuing to focus on engaging retailers in support of our category growth plans, supported by a full brand relaunch next calendar year. Finally, our Cat Litter business was down slightly, lapping strong double-digit sales growth in the year ago quarter. Similar to the other businesses, we're seeing much stronger sales and share performance in non-tracked channels than in tracked channels. Our Fresh Step Clean Paws innovation platform continues to grow strongly beyond its first year. So, we'll lean in further with dedicated advertising and continued trial-building activities. In our Lifestyle segment, sales grew 4%, reflecting growth in three of our four businesses. Burt's Bees delivered double-digit sales growth, fueled by strength in its core categories of Lip Care and Face Care. Successful innovation in Lip Care including the new watermelon lip balm that was the number one overall flavor at a key retailer and mass channel drove share growth for a 19th consecutive quarter and reinforced the brand's position as the number one overall lip balm in the category. In Face Care, there were record shipments of products such as face masks and pore cleansers as well as relaunched sensitive skin care line. The business also has a strong pipeline of innovation including a hemp line as well as men's line launching in Q3. For Burt's Bees, a combination of pricing and innovation has been a successful formula in driving strong category growth. Food sales were up for the quarter as well, reflecting higher shipments of dry Hidden Valley seasonings and dressings. The results were on top of strong sales growth in the year ago quarter. The Ready-to-Eat Dips innovation remained on track with plans to increase demand-building investments to expand usage occasion. The brand also extended its streak of share growth to 19 quarters. Brita sales were up slightly for the quarter behind higher shipments of our new Brita bottles and Brita Longlast water filtration systems, which performed strongly in the e-commerce and mass channels. The Brita business continued the streak of solid consistent volume growth dating back a year. Finally, sales for Nutranext were down this quarter, reflecting growth in our strategic brands and a double-digit decrease in our nonstrategic brands. Our strategic brands grew behind strong shipments of Neocell and Natural Vitality. The decrease in the nonstrategic part of this portfolio is mainly driven by our decision to exit the private label business that came with the acquisition. Moving up the initial integration phase of Nutranext, we're now working on optimizing the portfolio, focusing on a few strategic brands, representing more than 80% of the portfolio. We continue to be excited about the growth prospects of this business. Lastly, turning to international. Sales were flat for the quarter with volume growth, innovation and the benefit of price increases, offset by about eight points of unfavorable foreign currency impact. Despite the strong headwinds, we grew sales in Latin America and the International segment grew sales 8% on an organic basis. Consistent with our IGNITE Strategy that aims to improve profitability in international we continue to invest selectively in profitable platforms and see the returns on businesses like Burt's Bees and Cat Litter. Now, I'll turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss our Q1 financial performance and our outlook for FY '20. Kevin Jacobsen : Thank you, Lisah, and thank you everyone for joining us today. First quarter results came in generally as expected, as we continue to work through the challenges in our Bags and Wraps and Charcoal businesses. Importantly as we noted in our press release, we remain on track for fiscal year 2020 and confirmed our outlook. Turning to our first quarter results, sales decreased 4% reflecting about 3 points of higher trade spending about 2 points of unfavorable mix and about 2 points of foreign currency headwinds. These factors were partially offset by about 3 points of pricing benefit. On an organic sales basis, first quarter sales decreased 2%, primarily driven by our Bags and Wraps and Charcoal businesses. Gross margin for the quarter increased 60 basis points to 44% compared to 43.4% for the year ago quarter. First quarter gross margin included 180 basis points of benefit from cost savings and a 120 basis point benefit from pricing partially offset by 180 basis points of higher trade spending. I'd like to note that a portion of the benefits to gross margin was related to timing. First quarter gross margin also reflected favorability in commodity and logistics costs. And while it's still early in the fiscal year, we're encouraged by the cost favorability we're seeing in these markets. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of sales came in at 14% compared to 13.6% due to reduced operating leverage. Importantly year-over-year selling and administrative spending for the quarter declined. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales were about flat with spending for our U.S. retail business coming in at about 10% of sales. Our first quarter effective tax rate was about 22% equal to the year ago quarter. Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share of $1.59 versus $1.62 in the year ago quarter, a decrease of 2%. Turning to year-to-date cash flow, net cash provided by operations in the first quarter came in at $271 million versus $259 million in the prior quarter, an increase of 5%.  Now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2020 outlook. As we communicated in our October 2, press release we expect this year's sales to be down low single digits to up 1% reflecting our recently updated assumption of about 2 points of impact from unfavorable foreign currencies, primarily from Argentina. As I mentioned at our Analyst Day, we previously assumed devaluation of the Argentine peso at about 25%. And now our expectations are closer to 50%. Importantly, our fiscal year organic sales outlook remains unchanged reflecting 1% to 3% organic sales growth driven by innovation and our expectation for stronger business performance on Bags and Wraps and Charcoal in the back half of the fiscal year. Turning to gross margin, we continue to expect fiscal year margin to be down slightly reflecting our recently updated assumption on foreign currencies. Our fiscal year gross margin outlook continues to reflect our expectation for additional supply chain investments to support long-term value creation including our investment in the rollout of Clorox Liquid Bleach compaction in the spring of 2020. We continue to expect fiscal year advertising and sales promotion investment levels to be at about 10% of sales. We also continue to expect selling and administrative expenses to come in at about 14% of sales. Consistent with our fiscal year gross margin assumptions, we expect fiscal year EBIT margin to be down slightly. Our fiscal year 2020 outlook continues to anticipate our fiscal year effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23%. Net of all these factors, we continue to expect fiscal year 2020 diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.25. In closing, first quarter results came in generally as anticipated. We continue to work through the short-term challenges, we're facing in Bags and Wraps and Charcoal and continue to expect improvement in our overall results in the back half of the fiscal year. We're certainly pleased that our cost savings program is off to a good start contributing significantly to our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin expansion. Looking ahead, we'll continue to address short-term challenges while executing against the strategic choices we have made under our IGNITE Strategy. As we said at the Analyst Day, our focus with IGNITE is to create a virtuous cycle of generating fuel to continue investing to drive superior consumer value. We have a long track record of doing this successfully. And I continue to believe that once we work through the challenges we're facing in Bags and Wraps and Charcoal, Clorox will be in a position to deliver results that are more in line with our long-term financial goals. And with that, I'll turn it over to Benno. Benno Dorer : Hello everyone, and thank you Kevin. Here are my three key messages. First, Q1 results came in generally as expected. As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate fiscal year 2020 first half sales to be lower than the second half, as we continue working through the persistent challenges in Bags and Wraps and Charcoal. I am pleased we delivered volume growth and gross margin expansion in three out of four segments. And notwithstanding a tougher foreign currency environment, which drove flat sales in our international business for the quarter, our international team continues to make strong progress, delivering 8% organic sales growth and the seventh consecutive quarter of profit growth. Now clearly, we are not satisfied with our top line results. I do want to reinforce that improving Bags and Wraps and Charcoal is a top priority for us. We are actively working with customers to significantly strengthen our business plans with a keen eye on sustainable long-term improvement. This includes innovation that we believe will deliver meaningful value to our consumers and categories. Importantly, I'm pleased about the green shoots we're starting to see on these businesses. And I continue to anticipate improvement on Bags and Wraps and Charcoal in the second half of the fiscal year. My second message is that we're on track to deliver our outlook for the fiscal year 2020. This fiscal year brings another robust pipeline of innovation, led by the Compaction of Clorox Liquid Bleach as well as the launch of Clorox Compostable Cleaning Wipes, Clorox Fabric Sanitizer, Kingsford Pellets and several innovations in Bags and Wraps and Natural Personal Care. We will drive awareness and trial of these new products, while continuing to invest behind significant upside opportunity in ongoing innovation platforms, such as Clorox Scentiva, Fresh Step Clean Paws, Brita Filtering Water Bottles and Hidden Valley Ready-to-Eat Dips. I believe that consumer and retailer engagement in the strength of our innovation program along with stronger business plans for Bags and Wraps and Charcoal, supported by our commitment to excellent execution will contribute to improved overall results in the back half of the fiscal year. As I also mentioned previously, our fiscal year 2020 outlook continues to reflect our commitment to balancing our shorter-term focus on addressing the challenges on Bags and Wraps and Charcoal with strategic plans aimed at driving long-term profitable growth. Finally, my third message is this. I'm confident our new IGNITE Strategy will guide us in our ongoing pursuit of delivering long-term shareholder value. As we discussed at Analyst Day earlier this month, innovation to strengthen and extend our competitive advantage is front and center in our IGNITE Strategy. The integrated choices we've established for IGNITE create a virtuous circle of fueling growth and investing behind innovation to deliver superior value. By the end of fiscal year 2020, we expect to have begun activating brand purpose on all major brands, laying the groundwork to drive significant marketing ROI in the future. We expect to have engaged all major customers in new ways to create frictionless shopping experiences in-store and online leading to meaningful opportunities to drive category growth. We also expect to have surpassed 150 basis points of annual cost savings, supported by meaningful productivity improvements, moving steadily towards our new annual cost savings target of about 175 basis points. And finally, we expect to have made significant investments to drive stickier multi-year innovation platforms that differentiate our products and brands with a robust innovation pipeline in the back half of fiscal 2020. Everything we do is in service of superior value, because we know it's the key to winning with consumers. And of course, we'll continue our focus on growing the right way with ESG integrated into our business, so that we're also creating value for society. A recent announcement to join the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's New Plastics Economy Global Commitment is an example of this. As we reinforced at Analyst Day, IGNITE innovates for good growth, growth that's profitable, sustainable and responsible. Operator, you may now open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Dorer. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Good morning -- good afternoon. In terms of just near-term trajectory, I know you have quite a few initiatives like for second half across several businesses, but what about Q2? You talked a little bit about green shoots. Do any of those help already, or are those all sort of second half weighted? Kevin Jacobsen : Hey, Olivia, it's Kevin. Good morning. Let me see if I can take that one. What I expect in Q2, is you'll see improved organic sales growth. Now having said that, I expect our Q2 results to look similar to Q1, with a worsening FX environment, but improving organic sales growth and really because we're going to see improvements on both Glad and Charcoal. As you know, those are the two challenged businesses that we're working to turn around and I expect to see improvements next quarter. Benno Dorer : And then Olivia, of course, that means the growth will come in the back half. First of all, they'll have easier comps. I think everybody is aware of that. But we're also beginning to anniversary distribution losses in Q3. And as you know, we're very focused on strengthening distribution now. Two things are most important. We need Glad and Kingsford to improve and we expect improvement on both. And we're seeing green shoots I've mentioned that. Kingsford is growing mid-single digits in consumption lately. And Glad is starting to grow share where our plans are implemented by end quarter. So we feel good about that. Then, of course, we have a robust innovation program in the back half as stated. So the back half is where improvements are expected. We realize we have work to do this, but there's enough there to give us confidence. Olivia Tong : Got it. That's helpful. If I could ask a question about tracked versus non-tracked? I mean the spread between the two seems to be increasing. Obviously online continues to be a big driver. But is it growing even faster than it had been? Is that accelerating, or are there more efforts or just more opportunity across a broad spectrum of non-tracked channels whether it's club online or other retailers? Benno Dorer : Yes. What we've commented on is that the spread between tracked and non-tracked is indeed widening, right? And I think that's for two reasons. First -- and it was probably most evident in Home Care where we've seen the business down slightly but growing double digits in non-tracked channels. First of all, I would say, the consumer in part in our categories is migrating towards non-tracked channels. That's where a lot of the category growth is. We do know that our performance also market share-wise is better in non-tracked channels. And perhaps at this point, as we think about the post-pricing bumpiness that we talked about you'll find more of that which relates to distribution losses and perhaps less merchandising in tracked channels than in non-tracked channels. And what that gives us is confidence in the expected back half turnaround because we know that where our brands are able to perform, they do. And that's why the gap between track and untracked has been widening of late. Olivia Tong : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hi, everybody. A couple of questions. I think first on the issues over the recent period has been in trash bags and in wipes and such but now we're -- you mentioned distribution losses and in bleach as well some tough comps I suppose on litter. But it looks like some of the issues are expanding beyond some of the categories that were kind of initially in the area of focus. Can you talk about what's going on there if there's something connected between the various categories that we should be aware of? Benno Dorer : Thanks Kaumil. No, the issue remains Glad and Kingsford. If you think about the rest of the portfolio, there's actually quite a bit of strength. Burt's grew double-digits. Food, 19 quarters of share growth. The Professional business growing high single digits. Brita is now our fastest-growing business in terms of share. Parts of Home Care are seeing strength. Toilets, which is a strategic segment, has an all-time high in shipments. International performing well. So it's really Glad and Kingsford. If you take out Glad and Kingsford actually we grew organic sales for the quarter. Now I will tell you that if you just look at share, of course, there's always ups and downs, right? But what I'd tell you is, if you look at it over the longer term, which I think is perhaps helpful, we tracked eight businesses in terms of share. And six out of those eight if you compare the last quarter against three years ago are in line or higher. Home Care is in line coming off of 14 quarters of share growth. Bleach is higher than three years ago. Hidden Valley is higher than three years ago. Brita is doing well. Litter is about in line. Burt's is higher. It's really coal and trash. So, no news on the portfolio front. Clearly, not everything is performing as well as we want to, but much of the short-term noise can be attributed to the well-illustrated issues around lower merchandising and distribution losses post pricing. And as such we believe that they will be temporary. Kaumil Gajrawala : Okay. Understood. And then just finally on the expectations for the back half. It seems to be rooted in the return of distribution from some of the losses from last year. At what point -- do you know now if you're going to be put back in? Or at what point will you have a good sense on if we're going to be going into a period where there's distribution gains as opposed to distribution losses? Benno Dorer : Yeah. Back half clearly does assume that some of the distribution losses, which we're anniversarying in Q3 will be mitigated and that will start to make progress there along with easier comps and a strong innovation program. Categories generally are healthy. On the distribution side, we've commented that we're not -- we haven't been where we want to be in the last 12 months post pricing. And our focus is to make those temporary. Discussions are happening this quarter, so that's all work in progress at this point. Reasons that give us optimism as we're focused on achieving these improvements starting in 2020 is that we do have a long track record of partnering with retailers. It's obviously a very strong organizational focus area right now. I'm looking at our business plans for 2020 in particular on Glad and Kingsford. They need to be better and they will be better including robust innovation. And then our new IGNITE Strategy of course gives us plenty of partnership opportunities around creating categories for the future to drive profitable growth for retailers. So, work in progress. Many of them are happening as we speak, but a big area of organizational focus now. Kaumil Gajrawala : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good morning folks. Good afternoon I should say, by this point, the day is all blended together now. A quick housekeeping question. The logistics and manufacturing line in your gross margin bridge, it's been sort of a persistent drag for quite some time. But it's now moderated for two consecutive quarters to be reasonably marginal now in the first quarter. Is that a trend line we can expect to continue? Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah, Jason. I would say, I'd separate transportation from manufacturing. On the transportation side, as you mentioned, we're pleased to see favorable transportation rates for the first time and probably the better part of two years. We have about 20 bps of favorability, as we're seeing a decline in the spot carrier market. We talked about this before, but just as a reminder. About 85% of our transportation is contracted with our eight carriers and those rates are set. But we are seeing a reduction in the spot market that I believe will continue. It also bodes well that as we renegotiate rates in the future that that may generate ongoing benefit as we look out to fiscal year 2021 and beyond. So I started the year thinking transportation would be up low single-digits. And what I'm seeing right now, I suspect it will be flat to down low single-digits, so a nice improvement there. And then manufacturing, a little favorable this time. We had some delays in some of our investments for our new litter plant. You'll see that play out later on in the year. As I mentioned, we're going to have about 20 bps to 25 bps of investment in the supply chain. It was pretty light in Q1, but I still expect to spend that money in the year. So, we'll pick that up later in the year. Jason English : All right. That's helpful. And I guess I want to come back to the question. Everything excluding Charcoal and wipes, which don't seem to be really a whole lot worse than I was expecting. But your Cleaning segment, it's one of the weakest quarters in a very, very long time. And if Professional is growing high singles, it implies that the consumer-facing side of that business is now contracting somewhere in the 3% to 4% range. I'd love some context and color on what's causing that business to kind of get derailed. And as we look at the data, I think your biggest innovation platform in recent years has been Scentiva. And in Nielsen, if Scentiva is now declining high singles even with sort of a 14-point benefit coming from the Swiffer refills it begs the question of whether or not the issue there is just a lack of innovation effectiveness. I'd love your opinion on all those fronts. Thank you. Benno Dorer : Yes. First of all, Jason I'll strongly disagree with the statement that the business is derailed. I'm actually okay with where the business is at this point. And let me maybe take the two in turn. First of all laundry additives. The sales was down behind post-pricing distribution losses. We have anticipated those. We have commented on those several times and talked about them consistently. If you look at the bleach share for instance, I quoted shares versus three years ago because sometimes it helps to look at the forest but not look at trees. Bleach share is up 1.5 points versus three years ago. I hope that provides perspective. And now we're gearing up for a significant innovation in the spring, which includes bleach compaction and a new platform in the fast-growing laundry sanitizer segment behind us, an equity that is particularly well fitting there. Home Care, if you just look at shares, it's coming off of 3.5 years of share growth. It's normal to have some up and down, especially post pricing. Again loss in distribution well documented. At the same time volume grew in Q1. Sales is down due to non-tracked channels. They outgrew tracked channels by a wide margin. Out \u2013 non-tracked channels grew double-digits in absolute. So that's a negative mix effect. Wipes is growing mid-single-digits. Scentiva for the record is growing, which perhaps helps you understand the strength in non-tracked channels. And if you look at the past 13 weeks tracked channel share is lower than a year ago but it's higher than past 52 weeks. So we're making progress. I'll focus on this category. Obviously, an important category for us is on profitable growth. We will continue to activate the Clorox brand purpose, which has been working so well. And of course, we have a lot of innovation that I know you're well aware of lined up in the back half including our Compostable Cleaning Wipes launch, which is starting to go out in Q2 and then widely available in Q3. So, ups and downs, but I feel solid about where Cleaning is and optimistic about the back half with all the innovation coming in. Jason English : Okay, thanks a lot. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi, good afternoon. My first question just housekeeping. How much longer do we think the private label exit in the Nutranext business is going to continue to be a headwind? I know you said like 80% of the business is healthy and good. But just when should we expect that headwind to go away? And then my second question is just taking a step back on the fixed initiatives you're undertaking for Glad and Charcoal, are obviously huge and important. And between the two of them those are I think what 15%, 20% of your revenues. And so I'm just surprised that your guidance both for the S&A line on the P&L and advertising isn't higher than normal. I know 10% for advertising and 14% for S&A are kind of your long-term objectives. But I'm kind of questioning why in this year where it's so important to get those two big businesses really back on track you wouldn't sort of take a holiday from your long-term targets and just say \"This year we're going to spend more and absolutely make sure we get those businesses righted.\" Thanks. Kevin Jacobsen : Hey, Wendy, maybe I'll take the first question you had on RenewLife and how long as we exit some of that businesses both private label and contract manufacturing. I would expect to see that a drag for the balance of this year. We will continue to step out of that business over the next several quarters. And that's a pretty natural sort of transition out as we use that capacity for our own needs. And so you should expect to see that drag for the next several quarters. Benno Dorer : And then the second part Wendy, more money is not the option here certainly on the people and on the advertising side. If you think about Glad, what we're trying to do is fix the widened price gaps. And we feel good about the progress that we're making. And towards the end of the quarter and also in October where the plans are now fully implemented, which they are we're seeing a return to share growth. But the increased spending there is going into trade where we are spending more, but we feel good about advertising and certainly people. On Kingsford, it's all about better plans. As we've commented at Analyst Day, it's less of a money issue. And again, we've certainly spent quite a bit of trade money this last quarter to get rid of excess inventory. But we're pleased with the amount of money that we're spending behind those two businesses. As we've commented in the past, we're always willing to look at spending. We're also willing to lean into spending where that's indicated important and necessary. But we don't think that more advertising or people is the solution here. We're certainly spending more trade. But, the progress starts to be evident and we expect more progress to be had in the back half. Wendy Nicholson : And I'm just surprised. I guess the feedback from the retailers. I mean there's always -- the hope I know is to regain some lost share. But there's also a hope, I assume, of growing the category particularly in Charcoal. And I'm surprised that part of the conversation with the retailers isn't, hey, Clorox, you've got the biggest and most well-known brand. Please spend more money on advertising to get people to stop ordering their ribs from Grubhub and cook them at home. Is that not part of the conversation? Benno Dorer : So part of the conversation certainly is engaging the consumer. And like I said, Wendy, we spent quite a bit against the consumer. And we're making sure that the money counts with retailers as well. But if you think about the Charcoal category, the Charcoal category past 13 weeks, I believe, is up double-digits. And our business while it's still a little softer in shares is growing mid-single digits. So the conversations that we have are starting to bear fruit. And we're certainly seeing in this category as well as in other categories like Glad and in wipes, the strong correlation between the health of our categories and the health of our brands. If our brands are doing well, the categories generally tend to perform better. If our brands are not doing well, the categories are performing worse. And that very part certainly, is a key component of our discussions with retailers. Wendy Nicholson : Got it. Thank you. Kevin Jacobsen : If I just broaden that a little bit from just Kingsford and Glad. The other perspective, I'd offer is if you think about our IGNITE Strategy, we want to create fuel and we want to reinvest that back in the business. And I feel really good. If you look at our gross margin performance now, we've expanded gross margins for each of the last four quarters. And at the same time, we've increased advertising levels for each of the last three quarters. So, very consistent with our long-term strategic intent is we're going to drive waste out, and we're going to reinvest that in the brands to drive superior consumer value. And I think you're really seeing that over the last several quarters. Wendy Nicholson : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. First I had two clarifying questions. First is just a follow-up. Wendy, I think had asked about Nutranext. But I believe Kevin you responded to that talking about RenewLife. So, I just want to go back. And even when you acquired Nutranext, I mean to what degree did you have an understanding of the portfolio and that there'd be this decision to cut so much of the business, because some of the brands that were held up, I think they're described as kind of core seems to be what you're deemphasizing. So just sort of almost like a post-mortem on Nutranext would be great. That's the first follow-up. Thanks. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. It was Nutranext. I apologize, Lauren. That was a Nutranext answer. So when we acquired the business -- and this is typical. When we acquire businesses in many cases, it comes along with pieces of the portfolio that we don't have any interest in strategically. In this case, they had done a number of acquisitions. And so they picked up private label. They had some contract manufacturing. They have a number of minor brands in DTC that don't -- we don't see it having long-term value. And so, pretty typical for the first year or two we will clean that up and get the portfolio focused on what we think has long-term value for our shareholders. And that's certainly what we're doing. So, we're stepping out of the private label. We're stepping out of the contract manufacturing certain aspects of DTC as well and really getting this to the core portfolio that we believe has long-term value. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. And then the second thing was just about the second quarter. We've talked about things will improve. But then you also said the growth will come in the back half. So, I just want to be clear if second quarter sales expected to be down, albeit, a bit better than what we saw in Q1. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes Lauren, that's correct. I expect second quarter to look fairly similar to the first quarter in terms of sales, but the drivers will be different. The FX environment is getting worse. Keep in mind the bulk of our FX exposure is in Argentina probably 70% 75%. The big step-down in the peso happened late in August and so you have a partial impact in Q1. You'll get a bigger impact going forward and then that will be offset by improving organic sales. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. All right, great. And then the other thing I was curious. Sort of post-Analyst Day, I sort of look back and was then thinking back a few years prior to -- I guess it was maybe four years prior to Analyst Day where you'd introduced the concept of fuel versus grow brands. I'm sort of thinking about the degree to which that approach kind of got you to where you are now on some of these big more challenged businesses. So, I just want to talk about sort of -- there's these steps to improve the short-term challenges, but also maybe a structural change in how you address businesses across the portfolio. Is that sort of a fair thought process? Because it feels like maybe these businesses are to start for like good four, five years and that's sort of how we got here. And also what maybe led to some of the pricing decisions being as I'll call it stubborn as they sort of proved to be? Benno Dorer : Lauren not really. So, if I think about Glad trash, that's a growth business and Kingsford is a fuel business. So, there's no correlation there as I look at those two businesses. I think it makes perfect sense for us to disproportionately invest in businesses that are faster-growing and that are more profitable. And I feel good about that. Brita is returning to grow. Burt's Bees has had a strong run. The Food business has had a strong run. And many of those businesses are performing better than they did before we started the concept of fuel versus growth. I would point to post-pricing issues on those two businesses. We feel good about pricing. We have always said that this is a short-term versus long-term trade-off. It's absolutely necessary for us to offset cost increases through pricing to be able to ensure that we're able to drive long-term shareholder value. We continue to manage our business with an eye on the long-term. And as difficult as these -- some of these distribution losses and certainly challenges on Glad and Kingsford are, the reality is that we must power through them as part of our focus on long-term profitable growth. So, I feel good about the fact that we're offsetting pricing aggressively. I feel good about how we're managing the portfolio as a whole and see none of this is related to the choice that we made four years ago. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : Next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Hey, good afternoon guys. Benno Dorer : Hey Kevin. Kevin Grundy : First a housekeeping question for Kevin. So, first quarter, obviously, a bit soft. It sounds like second quarter challenged as well although contemplated in your guidance to some degree. Kevin I apologize if I missed this. Is it your preference to kind of level set expectations towards the lower end of the 1% to 3% organic sales guidance for the year? Or you still see it's possible to do the higher end which would imply something like 5% organic sales growth for the balance of the year which feels a little bit ambitious? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, Kevin. Thanks for the question. What I would say is I am comfortable with our 1% to 3% organic sales. I don't plan to provide any more insight in terms of high-low. I think that's a good solid range for us and feel comfortable with where we're at this point. Kevin Grundy : Okay. All right. And then a follow-up question on the margin structure in the Household business understanding the significant price investment in advertising and marketing going on there. But the margin in the quarter about 6.5% I call it for operating margin was one of the lowest that we see in that segment in a very long time. This had been a low 20% operating margin business not going back to too far. How do you see the margin structure for that business now going forward? How much of this is, sort of, a permanent impairment, higher cost of business, higher advertising and marketing, trade promotion levels with some of your big important businesses; charcoal, trash bags, litter et cetera? Do you see this as more, sort of, a permanent impairment? Or you think that, kind of, out of the woods after a challenging year this year? Then I'll pass it on. Thank you. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. Thanks Kevin. When I think about it in terms of margin in Household, one thing to keep in mind. The two businesses that are challenged Glad and Charcoal, they're our most capital intensive businesses. And so when you lose volume in those two businesses, you've got a lot of fixed costs that get spread over a lot of fewer units and have an outsized impact on margin. So my expectation is as we get those businesses back on track and growing, you'll see that reflected more positively in the margin line. Kevin Grundy : Okay. Thank you guys. I\u2019ll pass it on. Kevin Jacobsen : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hi, guys. So I have a few questions. But one Benno, I just want to take a step back around the pricing strategy. So look I get the bumpiness commentary. I get we've seen this before commentary. But honestly, I guess, I would have thought that bumpiness is going to be more from the consumer elasticity\u2019s, which has certainly been the case historically. But they're just -- there are many perhaps too many instances of the retailers reacting badly to the price increases. And I guess, I just want to ask a very simple question and I apologize if it's na\u00efve. But why do you think the retailers are kicking you off the shelf now when you're taking the price increases? Benno Dorer : Yes. So as you -- so consumer elasticity are good, right? So we have commented that they're largely unchanged versus before price increases. We've also commented on the fact that the consumer value measure actually is really positive with 54% of our portfolio being seen as superior, which compares to 53% before price increases. So pricing generally is performing as expected. Why do -- why are we experiencing these distribution issues? We certainly went out early and confidently. So I would perhaps point to that. Other than that you'd have to ask retailers. But clearly what we're seeing in some categories is that some competitors didn't follow where we might have expected them to follow. And as a result we get an outside reaction. But look I understand this. In many cases categories where we've lost distribution are softer too. I commented on the correlation between our performance and category performance. And that's really what we're focused on right now. Losing distribution as hard as it was is water under the bridge. We're focused on getting distribution back. And we're working with retailers now to make progress in 2020. Ali Dibadj : So I guess it's still helpful. But I guess because I just -- I'm sorry. I just don\u2019t -- I don't understand. So if elasticity\u2019s are good, the consumer doesn't respond poorly to this and that's all great. I mean their brands are good. So why are the retailers making -- it sounds like a mistake. What's going on? Is it that they disagree or\u2026? Benno Dorer : I'm sorry? Ali Dibadj : Is it that they disagree and that they view elasticity\u2019s as worse? Or they don't think your brands are good enough? Or why do they kick you guys off shelf in many instances now when you're taking prices up, if elasticity\u2019s are good and consumers are okay with it? It helps our costs, so I just don't get it. Benno Dorer : Let's take Glad as the best example perhaps. We took pricing before, resin flipped. And then there were questions about the cost justification of pricing. To be clear pricing continues to be justified but that doesn't mean that retailers like it. So that part while it isn't something that is up in the category, it's also pretty consistent with what we've seen in the past with the one exception that resin flied after we took pricing. But this is not uncommon Ali. It's worse but in part it is that we took pricing early and perhaps very confidently, whereas, some of our peers did not. Ali Dibadj : Okay, okay. And then -- so on the confidence going forward, confidence in the second half. Is lapping distribution losses in your second half guidance Kevin? Or is it actual kind of new distribution gains which is in your guidance? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. I'd say it's a combination of both. Certainly lapping distribution losses is a big element, when you look at our comps, we'll be lapping in the back half of the year particularly Q4. And then as Benno commented to a certain extent, we're actually working on rebuilding distribution and have some expectation in terms of how that will play out. But as we said earlier, those decisions are being made right now over the next quarter or so. So we'll have to see how that goes. It's still fairly early but there's certainly an expectation that we make progress there as well. Ali Dibadj : Okay. And just my last question around Cleaning, you went through it in detail, thank you Benno for doing that. Are laundry shelf space losses or laundry issues -- is that anything in anticipation of the compaction of the product? Or was it just an isolated and different incident? Benno Dorer : No. I wouldn't call that related to compaction Ali. It's a loss of distribution post pricing as we commented, but nothing related to compaction. No. Ali Dibadj : Okay, all right. Thanks very much for your help. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Steve Strycula with UBS. Steve Strycula : Hi good afternoon. So Kevin quick question for you on the gross margin, you talked about timing and cadence a little bit saying the first quarter was a little bit better. Can you walk us through some of the puts and takes for the gross margin? Should we expect it down for the next several quarters of the year for the balance of the year? That would be my first question. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure Steve. As you think about gross margin phasing, as you know for the full year our outlook is it will be down slightly. This was the easiest comp we had. We were down 150 basis points in Q1 last year. So we had a pretty easy comp. The other item to think about though is on cost savings, we had a very strong quarter. We delivered 180 basis points of benefit to margin. That was the strongest quarter we've had in five years. I am pleased with the performance. But we have a big number we're trying to hit this year and quite a bit of work ahead of us. So while I'm pleased with Q1, I don't expect to be taking the number up at this point. As I said previously our expectation on cost savings to be close to last year maybe a little bit better. That's 150 basis points, so you kind of phase that through the year.  Also if you think about pricing the bulk of the pricing we took last year was front-loaded. And so in Q1 with 120 basis points of benefit, I'd expect to see that decline as we move through the year. Same with FX, we have a partial impact this year -- or excuse me this quarter. So as you get the full impact from Argentina, plus the ongoing devaluation, I'd expect FX impact to be more negative going forward. And then finally, as I mentioned earlier, the supply chain events we're making fairly light in Q1. We will make those investments over the balance of the year. So you'll see that pick up in the manufacturing line over the course of the year. So when I play all that out, I still think, it's a balanced view about down slightly for the year. And that would suggest you'll see negative gross margins going forward, with our plus 60 to begin the year. Steve Strycula : Okay. And then, Benno a quick question. As we lap last year's, weaker flu season. Have you seen retailers start to build back up for the Cleaning and the wipes business, as they think about arguably an easy flu season compare? And then, can you remind us -- it's been a few years since we've had a compaction cycle. Just to think about, the various -- whether it's volume or margin implications that investors should think about as we move through that period in the spring. Thank you. Benno Dorer : Thanks, Steve. On the flu season, we're always working with retailers to prepare for flu season, no matter whether flu season is good or bad. So, we will be prepared to serve consumers, as they are looking for more disinfecting products. And on compaction, typically what you see, if we can repeat what happened in the last few times the way we did compaction is one the gross margin expansion. So we would expect that. I think that's pretty obvious as logistics and packaging material costs are lower predominantly. And then, what you often see is consumers migrate to larger sizes. And with that usually comes and expansion of consumption which in the previous two times also had a positive top line effect. So the primary benefit is on gross margin. But it does have a top line effect that can be persistent for the first 12 to 24 months post launch. Steve Strycula : Thank you. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would now like to turn the program, back over to you. Benno Dorer : Yeah. Thank you. And thank you for joining everyone. I wish all of you, a happy Halloween. And we look forward to talking with you again in February, when we report on our Q2. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Clorox Company Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call. Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. Lisah Burhan : Thanks, Sharon. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, our Chairman and CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for seven days on our website thecloroxcompany.com. On today's call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA, organic sales growth and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliations with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available on our website as well as in our SEC filings. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release. Please also recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcome could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. With that I'll start by covering our top line commentary, discussing highlights in each of our segments. Kevin will then address our financial results as well as outlook for the fiscal year 2020. Finally, Benno will offer his perspective, and we'll close with Q&A. For the total company, Q2 sales decreased 2%. These results are on top of solid sales growth in the year ago period. Organic sales were flat. I'll now go through our results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q2 sales were flat for the quarter as gains in Professional Products and Home Care were offset by a decline in laundry. In Home Care, sales were up behind strong volume growth across a number of product lines, including Clorox disinfecting wipes, Clorox toilet bowl cleaners, and Clorox Scentiva, particularly in non-tracked channels. Our Scentiva innovation platform continues to show robust growth, even three years after its initial launch. We remain focused on driving superior consumer value through innovations, like our Scentiva Wet Mopping Cloth, which are doing well and continue to build distribution. A new scent across the platform, Tahitian Grapefruit, will start shipping this month. Additionally, we were pleased to deliver record second quarter shipment growth of Clorox disinfecting wipes. However, our shares in this category continue to be down as a result of higher competitive merchandising activities, and we expect these activities to continue in the back half of the fiscal year. We're increasing our investments to support the long-term health of our brand. We're doing this in two ways. First, we're strengthening our merchandising plans with higher trade investments. And second, we're increasing our marketing investments behind Clorox compostable cleaning wipes, which have had a positive early reception from both retailers and consumers. Laundry sales were down for the quarter, driven primarily by distribution launches among retailers -- select retailers, which continued from last quarter. We expect improvement going forward as we start rolling out a full line of compacted bleach products this month. Our plans this fiscal year also include a new laundry sanitizing innovation platform, which started shipping towards the end of 2019. We're supporting this innovation through strong marketing investments to drive awareness and trial. Lastly, within the cleaning segment, Professional Products continued this momentum and delivered another quarter of robust sales growth, with broad-based growth across all channels and product line supported by innovation. Turning to the Household segment, Q2 sales were down 8% with declines in all businesses. In Bags and Wraps, Q2 sales were down due to ongoing distribution losses and select portions of the portfolio and increased competitive activity. While we continue to make progress and have seen sequential improvement in both volumes and sales, we've seen a further increase in competitive activity, consistent with what we've seen in past periods when there was a pullback in resin price, even on a temporary basis. We expect these competitive price reductions and higher promotional activities to continue in the back half for fiscal year. With a keen focus on consumer value, we're further increasing our investments in Glad and coupling that with a number of innovations to drive long-term profitable growth for our brand and the category. As expected, grilling sales were down double digits this quarter. While consumption was strong, it was more than offset by lower shipments and we finished working through high retail inventory from a weak 2019 grilling season and efforts that started in Q1. We expect to return to normal retail inventory levels as we enter the new grilling season. As a reminder, Q2 is a relatively small quarter for this business representing about 10% of annual shipments. Going forward, we remain focused on executing our strategy in three areas. One, enhancing the consumer experience; two, implementing the right trade and pricing structure; and three, investing in innovation including our core charcoal products and alternative fuels such as pellets. As noted in our press release, we've changed the name of this strategic business unit from Charcoal to Grilling, to reflect our broadest strategic view of the category. In RenewLife, which represents about 1% of total company sales, sales declined by double-digits due to the continued category and competitive headwinds. However, we're encouraged by the early signs of progress we are seeing with two of our three biggest customers now showing growth. As a reminder, a full brand re-launch will occur in the first half of FY 21. Finally, our Cat Litter business was down slightly due to higher trade spending and lapping strong double-digit sales growth in the year ago quarter which benefited from price increases. The Fresh Step Clean Paws innovation platform, which saw a double-digit increase in shipment this quarter, continues to show promise and we\u2019re behind this momentum in the back half. In our Lifestyle segment, sales grew 4%, reflecting volume growth across all businesses. Burt's Bees delivered a record quarter of sales, driven by continued strength in its core categories of Lip Care and Face Care. In Lip Care, Burt's Bees achieved a market leadership status in 2019 as the number one overall lip balm in the United States for the first time ever over a 52-week period. Burt's Bees lip balm has grown shares for 20 consecutive quarters for five years in a row. This success was fueled by a strong pipeline of innovation such as the watermelon enhanced flavors. In Face Care, Masks, the restaged sensitive skin care line and pore cleansers all had double-digit consumption growth. Food sales were up again this quarter supported by higher merchandising level, driving strong shipments of Hidden Valley Ranch products. On the innovation side, our Ready-to-Eat Dips platform is expanding to include French onion, Fiesta Ranch, and deluxe cheese and Ranch dips. And while a new Hidden Valley Ranch Secret Sauce line, which was launched in January, is continuing to help unlock new Hidden Valley Ranch eating occasions. Hidden Valley Ranch extended its streak of share growth to 20 quarters. Brita sales were up strongly behind higher shipments of our premium filtering bottles and Long Last filters and water filtration systems. New products, including large capacity plastic and stainless steel bottles, are expected to enhance the filtering water bottle innovation platform even further building on consistent volume growth in Brita that now dates back more than a year. Finally, sales for Nutranext were down slightly this quarter, reflecting double-digit decrease in our non-strategic brands, partially offset by solid growth in our strategic brands. We are encouraged by the success of our strategic brands, which was fueled by higher demand creation investments, and we\u2019re increasing those investments further to driver additional awareness and trial in these emerging and fast-growing categories. The decrease in non-strategic part of this portfolio was driven mainly by our decision to continue rationalizing the lower margin part of this business that came as part of the acquisition. Lastly, turning to International. Sales were down 2% for the quarter, reflecting 8 points of foreign currency headwinds, mainly from Argentina, partially offset by the benefits of price increases. Organic sales in the segment grew 6% consistent with our IGNITE Strategy that aims to improve profitability in international. We're continuing to invest selectively in profitable markets and growth platforms to keep yielding returns on businesses like Burt's Bees, Cat Litter, and the Clorox equity. Now, let me turn it over to Kevin who will discuss our Q2 financial performance and our updated outlook for FY \u201820. Kevin Jacobsen : Thank you, Lisah, and thank you everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased with the progress you've made in Q2 as we delivered sequential improvement and organic sales, our fifth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion and another quarter of strong cash flow. I'm also encouraged by our continued progress in Bags and Wraps and Grilling business units and expect to see continued sequential improvement on these businesses in the back half of the fiscal year. As you saw in our press release, I've updated our outlook which I'll discuss in a moment. Turning to our second quarter results, sales decreased 2%, reflecting 2 points of unfavorable foreign currency headwinds. On an organic sales basis, second quarter sales were flat. Gross margin for the quarter increased 40 basis points to 44.1% compared to 43.7% for the year ago quarter. Second quarter gross margin included the benefit of a 150 basis points from cost savings and a 100 basis points from pricing. These factors were partially offset by 90 basis points of higher trade spending and 80 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. Second quarter gross margin also reflected ongoing cost durability and commodities partially offset by the impact from foreign currency headwinds. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sale came in slightly higher at 14.5% compared to 14.3% in year ago quarter due to reduced operating leverage. Year-over-year selling administrative spending for the quarter was relatively flat. Advertising and sales motion investment levels of a percentage of sale came in at about 10% of sales are about equal to year ago quarter with spending in our U.S retail business coming in at 11% of sales. Our second quarter effective tax rate was 21% compared to about 19% in year ago quarter. Net of all these factors we delivered diluted net earnings per share of a $46 versus a $40 in a year ago quarter and increase a 4%. Turning to year to date cash flow. Net cash flow provided by operations for the last six months of the fiscal year came in at 498 million versus 449 million a year ago period, an increase of 11%. The year over year increase was primarily due to lower working capital, partially offset by the timing of payments. Now we'll turn to our fiscal year 2020 outlook. As we mentioned in our press release, we've confirmed our fiscal year sales outlook of down low single digits, dropped 1%. We are now projecting lower devaluations of the Argentina peso, which we expect to be offset by increased competitive activity and the bags and wraps and wipes categories, partially driven by resin cost deflation. Our fiscal year organic sales outlook now assumes a range of about flat to 2% growth. Embedded in organic sales assumption is a more cautious near-term view of our back half sales expectations for bags and wraps, reflecting increased competitive activity. Importantly, we continue to expect our grilling business to return to growth in the second half of the fiscal year. As a reminder, we've previously assumed devaluation of the Argentine peso at about 50% and now our expectation is closer to 40% devaluation over the course of the fiscal year. Turning to gross margin, we now expect fiscal year gross margin to be up slightly, reflecting our expectations for ongoing cost favorability and commodities and a slightly lower impact from foreign currencies. These factors are expected to be partially offset by a lower price and benefit in the back half as we have now last majority of our fiscal year '19 pricing actions. Our fiscal year gross margin also reflects higher trade promotion spending to address increased competitive activity and select categories. In addition, our fiscal year gross margin outlook continues to anticipate additional supplies investments to support long-term value creation, including a rollout of Clorox liquid bleach compaction beginning this quarter. We now expect fiscal year advertising and sales promotion investment levels to be slightly above 10% of sales, reflecting increased investments and support of robust innovation pipeline in the back half of the fiscal year. We also continue to expect selling and administrative expenses to come in about 14% of sales. We now expect fiscal year EBIT margin to be about flat. Our outlook continued to anticipate our fiscal year tax rate to be in a range of 22% to 23%. Net of all these factors, we now expect fiscal year 2020 diluted EPS to be in the range of 610 to 625 which ranges the lowering of our range by $0.05. Before I turn it over to Benno, I'd like to reinforce that I'm pleased with the progress we continue to make on our business. We delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion with strong contributions from our cost savings program. We also delivered another quarter of strong cash flow. Importantly, we remain on track to return to organic sales growth in the back half of the fiscal year. Looking ahead, I continue to believe Clorox to taking to results that are more in line with our long term financial goals, as to continue to focus on executing our IGNITE strategy to drive long term shareholder value. And with that, I'll turn it over to Benno. Benno Dorer : Hello, everyone, and thank you Kevin. Here are my three key messages for the second quarter. First, while our top line performance is not yet where it needs to be, I'm pleased with the progress we're making on our business which is evident in our Q2 results. As I look at the results of our overall portfolio in the quarter, I do feel good about the growth we saw in a number of Clorox branded products in our homecare business, even as I fully expect stronger growth in wipes category in the future. I'm also pleased about the broad-based strength in our Professional Products business. In Lifestyle, Burt's Bees continued its strong top line momentum with record quarterly sales, and we saw sustained strength in our food business, behind increased merchandising support, and also in water filtration behind innovation. And once again, our team in International continues to deliver very good results in currency neutral terms behind strong execution of our pricing initiatives. I'm also pleased to have delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion supported by our strong cost savings program. Importantly, we are continuing our focus on improving our bags and wraps and grilling businesses. On our grilling business, we're pleased to see solid consumption growth and we feel good about retailer reception to our go-to-market plans for the 2020 grilling season. Now that we're finished working through retail inventory from the year ago season, we continue to expect this business to grow in the second half. Now, as Kevin mentioned, we've taken a somewhat more cautious near-term view about bags and wraps business, given our expectations for continued increase competitive activity. Moving forward on that, we are focused on driving superior consumer value. We'll do this with a consistent stream of unique innovations, leveraging our superior capabilities and technology and consumer insights backed by category-leading advertising investments. We believe these focus areas will allow us to sustain a competitive advantage and help engage retailers leading to strong in-store position. As I look at the other parts of our portfolio, generally, I feel good about our backup plans, which effects our expectation for improved sales behind strong innovation and marketing plans as well as progress on the distribution front. This brings me to my next message, which is that, we have strong consumer and retail plans for the second half of the fiscal year, fueled by increased investments that reflect confidence in our innovation program. Bringing value to our consumers and retailers is the key to returning to growth. Our second half plans emphasize this and we're executing with a strong sense of urgency, yet also the right way. Our relentless focus on strengthening the value proposition of our brands through meaningful innovation continues with a strong pipeline of new products in the back half, including the compaction of Clorox liquid bleach as well as the introduction of Clorox compostable cleaning wipes, Clorox fabric sanitizers, Kingsford grilling pallets and several innovations in Bags and Wraps, Food and Natural Personal Care. As you saw on a press release, we're leaning harder into supporting awareness and trial behind these new products, with plans to increase year-over-year advertising spending in the second half of the fiscal year. And of course, we'll continue to invest behind the momentum and significant upside opportunity in ongoing innovation platforms such as Clorox Scentiva, Fresh Step Clean Paws, Brita filtering water bottles, and Hidden Valley Ready-to-Eat Dips. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect that our retailer engagement and the strength of our innovation programs will contribute to better back half results. I'm very encouraged by the strong retail receptions to our innovation so far, which is part of why we're stepping up our advertising investments. And finally, I'm pleased about our progress to improve distribution trends moving forward. We will provide another update in Q3 once results are in market, but assume feel good about the constructive conversations with retailers overall, putting us in a position to earn meaningful net distribution gains across our portfolio in 2020. And for my last message, I'd like to reinforce that I have the confidence that our IGNITE strategy will guide us in our ongoing pursuit of delivering long-term shareholder value. The focus of IGNITE is to innovate across the entire Clorox value chain to earn people's enduring loyalty to our leading brands. We are innovating how we build brands and on are track to begin implementing purpose on all major U.S. brands by the end of this fiscal year, which should significantly boost marketing ROI over time. We are innovating shopping experiences and making good progress, engaging customers in strategies to grow their businesses through new and frictionless experiences that can help eliminate shopping barriers in our categories. We are innovating how we work by continuing to invest in digitizing our supply chain to drive productivity and we remain focused on achieving our new higher annual cost savings target of about 175 basis points. And finally, we are driving our ESG commitments to create value for all our stakeholders. As we invest in major sustainability driven product innovations in the second half, we also are accelerating our goal of achieving 100% renewable electricity in the U.S. and Canada through 2021, full years ahead of our original goal. We continue to view ESG as fundamental to long term value creation and I'm pleased with our progress to integrate ESG even further in our business strategy. Operator, you may now open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Great, thanks. Hey, guys. Maybe first, Kevin, just a quick cleanup and clarification on Argentina. Are you getting incremental pricing in that market? And I just asked because I think your October outlook presumed you would not. I just wanted to understand what the current state was. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. Hi, Steve. Good morning. Yes, we are getting pricing better from Argentina. Maybe just a little more background there. As you saw, we've updated our expectations for devaluation. We assumed 50%. We've seen the currency hold up pretty well in our second quarter, and so we revised that to 40%. But additionally, we get out pretty early with pricing in Argentina. So, we took a number of price increases in the first quarter. They are certainly benefiting the overall profitability you may have seen in our International segment. Steve Powers : Okay, perfect. And then a second clarification, I think despite the competitive challenges, the flat organic result this quarter came in a little better than you telegraphed in October. Was there a particular driver there, and in the context of the full year coming down, that implied second half reversal. Is that just bags, Wraps, and Grilling staying weaker than planned for a bit longer, requiring more work or other areas showing less resilience versus what you hoped? Or is it -- I think it's the former, but I just wanted to -- want to clarify that? Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. So, on the first part of the question, yes. It did come in a little bit better than we anticipated. And there's really two areas. The first was FX, while it's still about a 2 point drag, that's a little bit better than we anticipated in the quarter, and then the other area was our Lifestyle segment that was really strong performance, and the performance is really broad-based. We saw every business within that segment perform quite well and exceed our expectations. And then as we look out over the full year, what I\u2019d say the two areas that we've highlighted is, we are seeing increased competitive activity in two categories; our wipes category and our bags and wraps category. So, because of that, we will increase trade spending to defend share in those categories, and specifically, maybe the bags and wraps I'd tell you, not surprising. We've seen this before. When we see the type of resin deflation, we typically see manufacturers invest more when that occurs. And so, we're going to have to spend some money to defend there. And then, Steve, on your question on Grilling, we continue to feel very good about grilling. It's on track with our expectations for the full year. We fully expect to return that business to growth, and so that business is very much on track. Steve Powers : Okay. And if I could, maybe for Benno, in addition to the promotional investment, you're also as you discussed stepping up the A&P investments, my guess is that that's targeted different businesses than the promotional spend. So, can you confirm that? And then I guess what's really motivating the uptick? Is it just that you have more funds given the -- given the FX environment? So you -- you feel like you have the flexibility to spend or is there something you've seen that's giving you more confidence in the ROI now versus three months ago? Thanks. Benno Dorer : Steve, the step up in investments really reflects our confidence in our plans. That's the sole motivation. It certainly does include a strong retailer reception to our innovations. Also in a few cases, strong initial consumption results out of the gate on some of the innovations that we launched in January, which includes compostable wipes. So, you know, we are leaning into this innovation to lean into the momentum that we all see, and of course, three months ago, six months ago, we would have said that we're taking a more realistic view of our spending given that we're still cycling through distribution losses, and now of course in the back half we are lapping those distribution losses. We expect, given the productive discussions that we have with retailers, solid results on the distribution front. So, it's really driven by the confidence that we have in our plans. The spending will go into innovations that we launched in the back half, but also innovations from previous years and I mentioned some like Clorox Scentiva, which is still showing robust growth, Clean Paws and Fresh Step, which grew double-digits last quarter, Brita Filtering Bottles, which is showing nice continued progress, ready-to-eat dips on Hidden Valley which we're supporting with more innovation going to back half. We feel really strongly and encouraged about all the back half plans, and we're not afraid to invest behind it. A question that maybe could come up in the context of it that is maybe worthy of addressing upfront is do we expect the change in our mid-term outlook on how much we will spend in advertising and sales promotion, the answer to that is no. This is really an increase that is really related to the back half of this fiscal year. We certainly commented in the past that we think that an average level of about 10% of sales per fiscal year is the right level, and we continue to believe that. Operator : Next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS. Steve Strycula : So, Benno, just a very straightforward question. Wanted to understand, the back-half sales is a relatively wide range and just wanted to understand based off your retail conversations would seem like they went well, what takes us to the low end versus the high end, whether it's the distribution clarity or maybe the consumer pull through and responsiveness to some of the innovation? Thank you. Benno Dorer : Yes, it's a combination, Steve. Certainly what we -- first of all, I have to say there's six months left in the -- in the fiscal year. But several things can make up for the range. First of all, competitive activity, right, we cannot predict that and we have commented that certainly in two categories, we're seeing the promotional and merchandising environment increase as those categories tend to be more sensitive in spending toward the -- in particular resin environments, which, as you know, is a little more favorable at this point, so cannot fully predict competitive activity, but that can have a major impact distribution outcomes. So we know quite a bit, of course on what distribution outcomes are, but we don't know everything. We also know from the information that we have about decisions that retailers may have taken as it relates to our brands, but not competitive brands. That's still ahead of us. And then of course coronavirus, cold and flu, you know that hasn't been a factor in Q2 and so far, we're not seeing an uptick but it's a rapidly evolving situation. So we're certainly watching that and we're getting ready to be able to supply our customers and also our healthcare institutional customers with products, should they need that to help consumers combat the virus. So these are three pretty important swing items that could lead us to the lower or higher end. But all in all, we feel like the midpoint of the range would point to a 3% sales growth in the back half on average, which of course is very much in line with our ongoing algorithm and because we are investing in items that don't just have a short-term impact but drive our brand equities and have a long term impact, we feel like those investments also set us up nicely for a solid fiscal year '21. Operator : Next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Andrea Teixeira : Hi, thank you. So I understand you have [indiscernible] Lisah Burhan : Andrea, you breaking up quite a bit. Hey, operator maybe we move onto the next question and try to have Andrea call back. Operator : Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi, good afternoon. A couple of quick ones. First thing, Kevin, maybe just to clarify the trade spending in the quarter, I think you said it was 90 basis points of gross margin pressure but if my memory is right, I think it was 180 basis points in the first quarter. So is that just a timing issue? I would have expected higher spending this quarter as you try to regain distribution etc., etc. and see more gross margin pressure from that, but curious if there's any commentary on that. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. Hi, Wendy, good afternoon. You're right on your memory, it was 90 basis points this quarter, it was a 180 basis point hit the margin last quarter. The biggest change from the first quarter is less investment in charcoal as we cycle through the bulk of the season, as I think, Lisa mentioned in her prepared remarks. Q2 is a very small quarter for us. So we have less investment in the category due to -- and as we also said what we're really working on the trade spending is working through higher retail inventories as we had a poor season year '19 and we want to make sure we're set up for a strong season year '20. And so we've been investing in trade in that business in both Q1 and to a lesser extent Q2 and we feel like we're in a good position as we head into season year '20 that we've got retail inventories right and we're ready for a much stronger season. Wendy Nicholson : Got it, got it. That makes sense. On the bleach compaction that I think you said were shipping this month. What's your expectation for competition? Do you think they follow the same degree of compaction? Do you think there's going to be incremental promotion? How much of a price increase are you embedding? Maybe if you could just talk a little bit more about that, that would be great. Benno Dorer : Yes, Wendy. So compaction is starting this month as you rightly said, and will take until the end of the fiscal year. There is no pricing, it's a straight conversion. Typically with -- with initiation of retailers, we see a whole category move. So of course we have yet to see that because that's really well outside our control. But if this compaction wave mirrors previous compaction waves then what we're typically seeing is the whole category to move because this really is an initiative that's certainly good for all the manufacturers, it's good for retailers, it's good for the category. It's also good for the planet. So it's a win, win, win and there really isn't a reason for the category not to move. Consumers of course are getting a more convenient product and again there is no performance trade-off for consumers either. So we are optimistic that this will be an initiative that will see the whole category move and we'll provide an update, after Q3. Wendy Nicholson : Got it. Fair enough. And then my very last question is just on trash bags. In the Nielsen data that we saw today and I know Nielsen doesn't tell the whole story or even -- even close to the whole story. But still, you commented on a higher level of competitive activity in the bags category. On the trash side in particular, it looks like private label is the one who is actually doing more of the promotions but their market shares aren't increasing. So I wondered if you could just comment kind of on your read where the promotion is coming from. What do you see in the broader universe and whether you're more worried about the branded side of the competitive dynamic or the private label side? Thanks. Benno Dorer : Yes, really varies by category, Wendy. On the Glad side, we see what you see that if I take us back a few months ago, what we said is that we are spending in trades to address price gaps that really works. We saw price gaps moves down and we saw significant increase in momentum on our business. What we've seen more recently in a more benign resin environments is that, in particular from private label, we are seeing more activity and we see price gaps increase again. Now we also see what I think you hinted on and that is, that that's really not working for the category. The category trends are softer. We've always commented that people are not buying more trash bags, if they're cheaper and that's pretty much how it's playing out. And what that really does is give us optimism that in the long run, rational behavior will prevail and that we're going to see a continued balance in the category that will allow premium brands to grow behind innovation and delivering value that consumer see as superior and that's certainly our focus in this category. Operator : Next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you for taking me back. Sorry for before. So I was hoping to go back to the cadence of the second half for organic. So I understand what you said in terms of -- in the past of regaining distribution in trash to one -- I believe one large customer. Is that something that we should be looking more into the fourth quarter building with what you mentioned to Wendy? And then on the gross margin, just a clarification in terms of the gross margin bridge, is that -- Kevin was talking about is our commodity is actually getting better like for the second half for, I understand you're going to lap some of these -- of these improvement by the fourth quarter. So I just want to know if embedded on that, you're actually having a better outlook for commodities than before. Thank you. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. Hi, Andrea. It's Kevin, I can take both your questions. On organic progression, what you should assume is we continue to demonstrate sequential improvement as we move through the year. And so, as you recall, in Q1, organic was down about 2%. It was flat in our most recent quarter and if you take a midpoint of our organic sales outlook, it would suggest 3 points of organic sales growth in the back half of the year and I would expect to continue to see sequential improvement as we move through the back half of the year. Much of the distribution benefits will have a bigger impact in Q4 than they will in Q3. And so that's our expected progress. And then maybe just also, as we think about our organic sales goal for the year, the 0% to 2%, I would just offer -- I'm much less concerned about the average for the year and much more focused on the momentum we're creating as we head into fiscal year '21. So I feel very good about the progress we're making and where I believe we'll end up in the fourth quarter as we head into '21. And then our gross margins on -- in terms of the commodity environment, what I'd tell you is, if I set resin aside, commodities are pretty much playing out as we expected, which is slightly inflationary, generally in line with broader inflation in the economy and that's pretty consistent with what we expected. What we are seeing is, while we expected resin to be deflationary, we certainly saw a bigger movement in the second quarter than we anticipated. I still think it will be down in the back half of the year, but to a lesser degree. Typically what we see is that manufacturers go down for planned maintenance in the spring and that usually puts a little upward pressure. Now, I think what we have to balance out right now is with what's going on with the coronavirus and it's certainly reducing overall global productivity. We'll have to see what that does to global demand for resin but for right now, my expectation is that it continues to be favorable, but not to the same degree we saw in the front half. Operator : Next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks. I just wanted to go back to distribution. Because, Benno I think the specific language you used was that, we're -- we positioned ourselves well to earn back distribution. So I just wanted to get a sense for how much visibility you do have at this point for both things building in kind of the traditional reset timeline of this quarter and then even going into Q4? Benno Dorer : Yes. So, obviously wording carefully chosen because as always, and as all manufacturers, we have to earn distribution from retailers, right, because they have to believe that our products are value added, said that, two things are going on. First of all, as you remember, there are a number of distribution losses post pricing that we're now lapping in the back half. So that should play in our favor. And then, realize that you'd all like a very detailed updates but the reality is not all decisions are made by retailers requiring us to be respectful here. There are of course also competitive implications because this is all sensitive and, like I said earlier, we know quite a bit of our distribution results for the back half, but not all. This will play out with implementation in Q3 and Q4. But clearly I think as you also saw us talk about the conversations that we have, we feel good about them being constructive and productive. We have a lot of innovation. Innovation, generally is effective driving distribution and our sales outlook for the back half wouldn't be doable without generally a more favorable environment on distribution. So I think this is probably the appropriate way for us to characterize where we are. There'll be a further update in Q3, but the fact that we are investing more in our brands is based on confidence as we've all said earlier and certainly how we feel about the conversations that we have with retailers, an indication that we may get, should they materialize the way we think they might, we feel positive about what we'll see in that environment and then more update in Q3. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great, thanks. And then just continuing to another question on the bags and wraps category. So, one thing that's changed very recently is now your competitor, right, is public. So we've got a lot more visibility into dynamics in that category. And I think many of us sort of understood in the past. So one of the things that was interesting to me in that process was seeing the innovation with, in particular with ultra strong rates sort of a bag, that's a real competitor to ForceFlex and that it's actually been on -- it's been capacity constrained there. So it just -- looking forward, is your thinking about competitive dynamics thinking about your branded competitor thinking about innovation there, thinking about that they were capacity constrained while you were losing distribution. Just anything more you can offer on this build back rate. Is there a lot of innovation in your plan? Is there adjustments in your pricing structure that kind of helps you regain leadership positions as a total in that business? Thanks. Benno Dorer : Yes, Lauren, of course, we are following that closely, even though I will tell you that many of the things that you quoted were news to us. I certainly don't want to speculate about what might happen, but there are two things, perhaps are most important here. The first one is that generally publicly traded companies care about the top line and also margin growth and what that does is drive productive and rational behaviors. So we just leave it there. And, second, we remain confident in our right to win in these categories, which really isn't affected by them going public. First of all, we have commented on a superior innovation capability that we continue to have with the joint venture that we maintain with Procter & Gamble. I'd just point to the more than 100 patents and patent applications that we have over the last five years, and that compares to less than 10 for the said company. And then as we think about our brand building efforts, the fact that we continue to be a leading investor in the consumer in this category, along with our commitment in superior consumer value, that's been a robust right to win for sure a decade and a half now since we've had the joint venture. And the proof will be in our continued innovation and without getting into details. All I can say is that we have a lot of confidence in not just our back half innovation on this business and as you know, there is quite a bit, but in the long term innovation as we manage innovation with minimum three-year timeframe, we know obviously about the innovation that we have are coming on to the business and we're pretty happy with the innovation platform that we have on Glad and we're pretty confident that we can get this business back on track once we've cycled through the well-documented issues, which we continue to characterize as short-term. Operator : Next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Great, thanks. Want to talk a little bit on your commentary around competition spends and why you think that about 10% is still the right number, because if competition is spending more and you feel good about your line up, why wouldn't you look to invest more heavily over a longer term period or is it just that you prefer to keep that flexibility in between trading support between promotion and advertising? Thanks. Benno Dorer : Yes, Olivia we've always commented that we're not afraid to spend more, should there be an opportunity, and right now, certainly, there is an opportunity. And spending, of course is also broadly defined, right, whether that's in advertising, sales promotion or capital spending in initiatives that deliver growth. So we will always prioritize the long term health of our brands. We will always manage this business for the long term versus for the quarter. So all those things that -- I know you're used to from Clorox, they remain true, said that, you know, we think that the overall spending level in advertising and sales promotion isn't going up. So as a general rule of thumb, we like the 10%. Part of why we're taking it up in the back half is that in the front half, we spend less than 10% because we have waited for our back half innovations to come on and certainly the fact that our margin situation is slightly more positive. It gives us a little bit of room to do so. But 10% continues to be the right number, we'll always take a look at that, but that's been the right number for a while and we don't see any reason why we should move off of that. Olivia Tong : Got it. And then just on gross margin. Raw materials, obviously, we can see, has been a nice driver. But has there been any change in your expectations in other areas particularly either cost saves or manufacturing logistics? Last quarter you mentioned a delay in the litter plant. Any other changes in terms of the timing of project that might be helping this year, but the expenses will eventually come and the investments are just further down the line? Kevin Jacobsen : Hi, Olivia. Yes, I would say, no real changes in timing or expectations for the year. As we mentioned, we have two large cost savings projects, bleach compaction, our new litter facility, those projects both continue to progress. As you know, obviously compaction, we're starting this quarter, litter we're probably 18 to 24 months out before we bring a new plant online, but those both continue on track. Operator : Next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC. Nik Modi : Yes, good afternoon, everyone. Benno, can you just talk about what's going on in Laundry in terms of some of the distribution losses? I mean, is there a plan here? Can we build distribution or is it just cutting space overall of the aisle? And then on the compaction, how should we think about the margin implications of that as you guys kind of get the full scale of the distribution of that product? Benno Dorer : Yes. Thanks, Nik. Laundry was down for the quarter, certainly in volume and share and it's not our aspiration for the business and certainly not happy with that. The reason is mostly post pricing distribution losses sound like a broken record, perhaps, but that's, of course, been a known issue on several of the categories and something that we're cycling through. Said that, I'll also give the perspective that our past 13 weeks share through November is about 61% and that's well within the long term range and just to name three examples, it's higher than it was two years ago, or three years ago or four years ago. So maybe that's helpful for perspective. Feeling good about back half plans, obviously on the distribution side, cannot say what will happen to the category. We have seen a little bit of a contraction in overall space that retailers dedicate to this category, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. And generally leading brands and importantly leading SKUs are benefiting from that because there is greater shelf clarity. So we haven't seen a reduction in overall shelf space for the category leads to a reduction in sales or a reduction in market share. It would be our expectation that among compaction, perhaps or after compaction perhaps distribution is about neutral versus what it is today, because all we're trying to do is convert the category. We're not using that as an opportunity to build distribution. We're really leveling the playing field with compaction. Margin impact on compaction, obviously is positive. What we've commented on in the past, is that the last time we compacted, it was a 500 basis point margin improvement to the business. We'd expect this one to be somewhat lower, but still meaningful to the business. So feeling good about compaction and feeling that this initiative is on track. Also want to point in Laundry to fabric sanitizers which we're launching now and is off to a good start and that will be one of the initiatives that we're investing in quite significantly because it's a growing category that's become quite sizable and it's one, given the nature of the category, sanitization where we feel like the Clorox name has a strong equity with consumers and customers, for that matter, and we feel like our products can add meaningful value to that category and its momentum. So feel -- feel good about the back half in Laundry and expect better results, certainly not happy with the share losses and also the volume losses in Q2. Operator : Next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hi guys. I have a few. I would like first to just go back to Lauren's question. We've seen Glad volatility based on commodities for a while. It just -- it feels like the market share shifts have been a little bit more severe this time, particularly -- I am tying bags and wraps specifically, sorry, particularly given the fact that you changed your portfolio on bags and wraps and gotten out of the kind of lower-end stuff for the past few years. And so I struggle with Reynolds hasn't changed the dynamic of the industry, that margin dynamic for you that much, particularly because you guys will remember but I think a lot of people don't remember this when PakTech was public, it's not like things were easier. In fact, it sounds like they are harder than they were in the past few years. So I just want to go back to that question and really get a sense of whether you really think there is no impact or is even better that a big competitor is now public and and I'd say that in the context of a category that just doesn't grow, so to grow your top line, you basically have to go to some market share. Benno Dorer : Yes, on profit. So all I'd say is that I don't want to speculate at this point and what -- all I did say is that for a publicly traded company buying growth and buying market share, it doesn't necessarily work, because the margins and profit growth matters, too. So we'll see how it all plays out. You and I have followed this category for a long time obviously, I don't remember it being easier or more difficult when PakTech was public. The reality is this is a very competitive category, there is no question. And we have lost some market share but if I unpack that a little bit, the market shares are mostly because of post pricing distribution losses. So it's our own doing and what I've commented on in the past is that we have taken into account a very conscious trade-off between short term and long term. If you then look at where the distribution losses occur though and also the share losses occur, they are mainly in the less profitable base trash segment, as you know and also in food storage. As you know, we're very focused on trash. If I look at the indoor premium trash bag, which is the heart of our business and also the largest sub segment in trash and as you can imagine, one of the more profitable parts of the business, that part actually grew in Q2. So there is puts and takes on Glad, clearly we're taking a more cautious approach. Clearly, we are in a mode of defending this business and not everything is rosy while we're seeing green shoots. But what I'd say is that we have confidence in our right to win in this category. The right to win in this category does not change and we're investing behind it which expresses our confidence going forward. Ali Dibadj : No, helpful context. I do want to go back to -- you mentioned long term and short term and just ended on investments. You guys over the -- over a while have looked at things like charcoal strategically and Brita strategically and other than I'm sure you're not going to name strategically, I'm sure Glad is in there as well. I guess if you take a step back. Why do you own Glad strategically? Benno Dorer : First of all, I can't confirm that we've looked at certain businesses that you've mentioned. Ali Dibadj : Understood. I get it. Benno Dorer : So, that would be speculation on your end. And I hope you can tolerate me saying that. Why do we own Glad? Why do we own Glad strategically is, first of all, it's very aligned with our capabilities, first of all. Second, over the long term it's added an enormous amount of shareholder value. So obviously we want each of the businesses that we own to add shareholder value in the long term. That does mean that every now and then there is a business that struggles in the short term. And you know whether that was Brita a year or two ago, which is now one of our strongest performing businesses or litter and charcoal certainly falls into that camp right now as well. That does happen in a highly diversified portfolio. So while we always look at whether and how we can be the highest value owner of our business, we like this business, we're confident in our plans forward and it's a very solid fit with our capabilities on multiple fronts. Ali Dibadj : Okay,. And then last question maybe for Kevin on the gross margin drivers. If you look at kind of a net price, so price change and then subtract out the trade spend that you mentioned in the footnote went negative 60, negative 10 and really if you go back it was positive-positive in '19 then negative 60, negative 10 for Q1, Q2. Well, maybe it was on, I think, Wendy's question earlier but like, what should we expect the gross margin impact of net pricing to be as we go forward? Kevin Jacobsen : Definitely, there is a pretty big inflection point that will start in Q3 as I'm sure you'll recall most of the pricing we took last year was front-loaded. And so it's driven very nice benefits to margin. You'll see a pretty material change starting in Q3. So if you think about the front half of this year, pricing generate about 110 benefit to gross margin. I expect in the back half of the year, you'll see that closer to 20, 25 benefit as we now cycle through it. And so what I expect to see going forward is a smaller benefit from pricing, a little bit of International still to go, and then you'll have the impact of trade spending as we've talked about some increased competitive activity that we'll address with increased trade spending and so trade spending will outpace the benefit from pricing as we think about the back half of the year. Ali Dibadj : Got it. So it's like a negative 90 basis point we saw from higher trade promotion spend in that footnote number four will be even higher than 90 as the price changes will be closer to 20 to 25? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, I think in terms of the net benefit just because you will see less benefit from pricing, you'll see ongoing trade investment. Operator : Next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : Thank you, everybody. Benno, you mentioned that you're now happy with inventory levels. Can you give a little more context on the impact that decreasing inventory levels had on your top line over the past couple of quarters? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, Kaumil. Hey, this is Kevin, I can address that one. And I would say we feel very good about the progress we're making on inventory. In fact, if you -- if you saw in our prepared remarks, we had very nice growth in cash provided by operations over the first six months was up 11%. That's primarily driven by some really good work we're doing on improvements in working capital and specifically, inventory. And I would highlight a number of areas. The first is on our Nutranext acquisition. We've owned that business a little less than two years. And I think we continue to get better understanding the demand signal and managing inventory to meet demand, so we've got more efficient on that business over time. The other two I'd point to is on Brita. If you recall, we've moved our supply chain. We're just finishing up moving our supply chain out of China to the Dominican Republic. We started to do that work because of the tariffs that were imposed. But we've built up some additional safety stock inventory to manage that transition, which we're mostly through now. And beyond doing the safety stock system, we also now have moved production much closer to the market and to allow us to keep less inventory going forward. And then the last item I'd point to is, we've done some nice work in our Glad business. You know, as we recapitalize that client based on our new technology, if you recall, ForceFlex came off patent, a while back. We've introduced our new patent protected technology and we've invested manufacturing assets behind that technology and we brought some more in line recently that's allowed us to reduce overall inventory levels on Glad and has been very nice benefit that should continue. And so good work to date. What I'd also tell you though is, as we look forward and Benno made this comment earlier, we do understand the coronavirus is something we're thoughtful about, we'll see how that plays out with retailers, but we are taking up inventory levels to be prepared for the potential increase in demand for some of our bleach products. And so that's something you'll see in the back half of the year. Kaumil Gajrawala : Okay, got it. And then you also mentioned in your -- in the press release on cleaning some unfavorable mix effect from channel shift. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're talking about there. Is this product specific? Is it margin specific? What exactly is the difference there? Benno Dorer : Yes. Pretty simple, Kaumil. Thanks for allowing us to clarify. So there is some non-tracked channels where the net sales for volume sold is lower, right? So think about Klub, typically where products are sold at a discount, that shows up as a drag at the sales or at least in the volume to sales ratio and that's happened in cleaning, where we see certain parts of our portfolio in part of the non-tracked channel perform particularly well. Operator : Next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Excellent. Thank you guys for squeezing me in and I appreciate it. Two questions from me. First, a pretty simple one on compaction. You start shipping this quarter, should we expect a nice pipeline fill given the shelf holding capacity should accommodate many more bottles with the smaller size? Benno Dorer : Not really. I don't think it's going to be very material, Jason. Jason English : Okay, like I said, that was a quick and easy one. Now stepping back, you've mentioned a few times the -- the broad-based distribution losses that you've suffered in the wake of the price increases. I step back and I rewind the clock to the time where you were taking these prices and you were very pleased then and you were very confident then like you are now in the strength of the relationships with the retailers and I think I remember you saying the talk the talk, the conversations are strong, the message is one of support for you. Yes in the wake, we've seen a lot of negative ramifications for those actions. So what changed? Where -- what did you sort of misjudge in that, that caused that derailment? And since all that's happened, what steps have you taken to kind of go the other way in mending those relationships and strengthen them to the point where you now have this resonating confidence in your ability to recover the distribution and drive the sharp inflection in the back half? Benno Dorer : Yes, if I rewind and what really happened was that, first of all, right after we took pricing, our consumption was very strong, as you will remember. That was prior to distribution losses but what we said then is that we expect significant bumpiness and a significant bumpiness would show up, for example in distribution losses and in merchandising losses. So that's exactly what happens and as a result, I don't really see any change. So you don't find me any more or less confident on this than I was six months ago or 18 months ago. The reality is that we are playing a long game here. We are protecting our ability to grow margins in the face of cost adversity with an eye on the long term and retailers understand that, but retailers certainly also didn't consistently like that as we had anticipated. Where the case is perhaps like on Glad that where it was more pronounced than we had anticipated, I would absolutely say that that's true in parts, because as we've duly noted, like so many institutions and companies, we didn't necessarily get the resin forecast right, right? So if I look back, I would have liked to get more accuracy into our resin forecast because maybe our plan forward then would have been different and maybe distribution losses, if I speculate for a second, would have been more benign. But by and large, this is playing out exactly as we anticipated then. We've always said that we're after good growth and good growth is profitable and sustainable and responsible and we don't like the distribution and the share losses either, at the same time, we do like our margin enhancements, which allows us to invest in the momentum of our brands in the back half and that's what we're focused on. Operator : And we have a question from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kevin Grundy : Hey. Hello, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in, two quick ones for me because we've covered a lot of ground. Benno, I just want to make sure I'm clear on the messaging with respect to the adequacy of the investment levels in your guidance for this year. So it sounds like the additional investment behind price and trade investment in advertising and marketing will position the Company well to get back to its normal type of algorithm back half of this year and into next year. So both top line and from an earnings perspective as best we know sort of steady state commodities, if you could confirm that. I'm just trying to handicap the risk that this is a multiyear necessity for higher investment levels, so maybe you could just comment on that. And then quickly on M&A, given some of the challenges in some of your bigger businesses, are you any less inclined near term on the M&A front, given the potential distraction and integration risk. Thank you. Benno Dorer : Yes, I'll take M&A and then Kevin is going to take your good question on advertising sales force levels. Not anymore or less inclined to do M&A, than we always are. As we always comment, we look at many things throughout the year, certainly continue to find desired valuations to be on the higher side and we'll continue to be disciplined. What we have said in the past is that our priority is to have a healthy core. So our focus right now is on just that and we like the progress. Said that, for a good acquisition that is on strategy and where we feel like we can add clear value to a business, we remain open, so that there is no change to what we've talked about during our Investor Day in October. Kevin Jacobsen : And Kevin, on your question about investment levels, I will make a couple of comments. First is, I'm sure you can appreciate, I won't provide any outlook for fiscal year '21. We'll come back and do that at a later date. But what I would say is, as Benno mentioned, we do believe 10% about is the right investment level, sometimes a little bit more, sometimes a little bit less, but feel like that's the right level of investment long term. And we are working to get back to our IGNITE financial goals that we set back in October, if you recall, 2% to 4% top line growth. We believe, we're taking the right actions to get back to those levels in the back half of the year and that certainly what we care about is that momentum going into fiscal year '21, that we get back to growing the top-line. And since they are the long-term goals, we're expanding margins, and we feel pretty good about our ability to do that. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would now like to turn the program over to you. Benno Dorer : Yes. Thank you all and all that's left is to say is that I look forward to talking with you again in May when we discuss our Q3 results. Thank you and have a good day everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Clorox Company\u2019s Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President, Investor Relations for the Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin the conference. Lisah Burhan : Thank you, Christine. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, our Chair and CEO and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. Before I go into results, I just want to express how grateful we are to be speaking to all of you today. This is clearly an unprecedented time. Our thoughts are with everyone who has been affected by this pandemic, especially those who have lost friends and loved ones. At the same time, we are also inspired by so many frontline healthcare workers, first responders, delivery and grocery workers, our own production employees and more. We are grateful to them for their selfless dedication to helping others. A few usual reminders before we go into results. We are broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for 7 days on our website, thecloroxcompany.com. On today\u2019s call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA, organic sales growth and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliations with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today\u2019s press release, this webcast\u2019s prepared remarks or supplemental information available on our website as well as in our SEC filings. In particular, it maybe helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today\u2019s earnings release. Please also recognize that today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements, including among others, statements related to the expected or potential impact of COVID-19. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management\u2019s current views, beliefs, assumptions and expectations and plans. I would also direct you to read forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release. Please review our most recent 10-K filings with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcome to differ materially from management\u2019s current views, beliefs, assumptions, expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Turning to today\u2019s discussion of our business results, I will start covering our top line commentary as usual with highlights in each of our segments. Kevin will then address our financial results as well as outlook for fiscal year 2020. Finally, Benno will offer his perspective and we will close with Q&A. For the total company, Q3 sales grew 15%, reflecting increases in every reportable segment. Organic sales were up 17%, supported by strong volume growth in all segments and significant demand of our products during the pandemic, products that either play an important role in public health or support the everyday lives of people, especially as they spend more time at home. In Cleaning segment, Q3 sales were up 32% for the quarter, with strong double-digit growth in all three businesses. For perspective, more than two-thirds of sales in this segment come from products with disinfecting claims. In Home Care, Q3 sales increased by strong double-digits behind broad-based growth across the portfolio, with all-time record shipments of Clorox disinfecting wipes, Clorox ToiletWand, Clorox cleanup disinfecting spray, Clorox disinfecting bathroom cleaner, Clorox Scentiva products and Clorox toilet bowl cleaner. Shipments were strong across all channels, but especially in non-tracked channels such as club and online, where volume growth was nearly double that in tracked channels. While early, we are encouraged to see from our data that the majority of the higher demand is coming from incremental households rather than just stockpiling or higher usage from existing users. With the pandemic expected to have a sustained positive impact on consumers\u2019 disinfecting and hygiene habits, we will invest further in our brands, turn incremental usage into loyalty. Laundry sales also grew by strong double-digits for the quarter fueled by high demand for Clorox Bleach. It has long been recommended by public health authorities for its disinfecting capabilities and the positive role it plays in public health. As we have mentioned in higher communication, we are running our plants around the clock to get our products to where they are needed the most. In the case of Clorox Bleach, we have been directing our shipments to healthcare facilities to prioritize supporting those on the frontlines of public health. Putting recent demand aside, our bleach compaction rollout is in line with expectations, with our Clorox laundry sanitizing products are now on shelf. Consistent with our IGNITE Strategy we will support our brands and innovations with strong marketing investment to drive awareness and trial at a time when hygiene and disinfection is top of mind for consumers. Lastly, within the Cleaning segment, our professional products business also saw strong double-digit sales growth driven by unprecedented demands from healthcare facilities and commercial cleaning institutions that rely on our portfolio of disinfecting products. In this channel, higher shipments are driven by higher usage as healthcare facilities are operating at full capacity and there is a step-up in cleaning protocol everywhere. Turning to the Household segment, Q3 sales were up 2%. Our Cat Litter sales were up strongly behind double-digit increase in volume as cat owners stocked up on essential products to care for their pets. Our Fresh Step Clean Paws product line continues to resonate well with consumers with all-time high record all-time record high shipments this quarter, even its third year after initial launch. We\u2019ll continue to build on this differentiated platform and also highlight the value proposition of our Scoop Away brand, which is seen as affordable yet high performing. Grilling saw solid sales growth for the quarter, with grilling occasions up significantly as consumers stayed home. Importantly, we began to see improvements in the base health of this business even before the surge in demand related to COVID-19. There was higher consumption in January and February, and our share of the total Grilling category was also up at the end of February in tracked channels. Our innovation in pellets, a growing segment, shipped in March, and we\u2019re in the process of expanding distribution, which will build throughout the grilling season. Early retailer response to our plans has been positive, helping drive strong sales. Going forward, we\u2019ll continue to build on this momentum, focusing on our strategy that includes enhancing consumer experience, implementing the right trade and pricing structure and investing in innovation. Glad sales were down slightly for the quarter. Like the other businesses, Glad also saw assertion demand as consumers stocked up on essentials to stay at home. However, that benefit for this business was more than offset by the negative impact from the loss of distribution at a customer. It\u2019s important to note that while there are many puts and takes in distribution in any particular quarter we expect an overall net gain in distribution by the end of this quarter through significant wins at other customers. Earlier this quarter, before the surge in demand from COVID-19, we had already begun to see share improvements due to progress, including price gap and increased distribution in tracked channels. And we\u2019ll continue to build on this progress, coupled with strong innovation and retail execution, return to profitable category growth. Going forward, we expect higher demand to continue accompanied by higher usage as long as consumers are staying at home. In RenewLife, sales declined by double-digits due to continued category and competitive headwinds. While there are early signs of progress and pockets of success, this business is not where we want it to be. We continue to believe this is a space with long-term tailwinds. Since we acquired this business, the category has fragmented more, including a proliferation of offerings that has led to an overall category deflation. We are actively partnering with retailers to reinvigorate the category. We have been seeing volume growth with two of our three top customers. Our brand re-launch in FY 2021 is on track. In our Lifestyle segment, sales grew 10%, reflecting growth in three of four businesses. Brita sales were up high double digits on top of very strong results in the year ago quarter. Our data shows that people are seeking out Brita filtration systems and filters to ensure they have access to clean, great-tasting water during this pandemic. Brita is a business that has been building momentum even before the onset of the global pandemic, with consistent volume growth dating back more than a year. During this recession, we will be focusing our marketing communication on value to further build on the good progress we\u2019ve made in household penetration and share to drive profitable growth in the long run. Food sales were up strongly for the quarter driven by higher shipments of bottle Hidden Valley Ranch dressing and Dry Hidden Valley Ranch seasoning as many more people cook at home. The surge in demand due to COVID-19 builds on an already strong momentum within the Hidden Valley franchise, which has grown share in tracked channels for 21 consecutive quarters. Going forward, we expect this momentum to continue. The last recession, our Food business grew as people ate at home. The strong results in this quarter are allowing us to invest further in building our fast-growing online presence to capitalize on the ongoing shift to this channel. Sales were up strongly for the quarter driven by continued strength in Lip Care and Face Care. And sales were driven by volume growth due to innovation, including double-digit shipment increases for both renewal and sensitive skin line. Also contributing to the strong growth this quarter were higher shipments of personal hygiene products, in particular, cleansers, moisturizers, baby care products that are so important to protecting families today. In March, the overall Beauty segment was negatively impacted by store closures as well as lower foot traffic in stores that remain open. As the stay-home measures are prolonged, consumer shopping patterns have also changed. While we expect the near-term while we expect softness in the near term with this category continuing to be negatively impacted, we believe the future of this business is bright as fundamentals of our Burt\u2019s Bees brand remains very strong. Finally, sales for Nutranext were down by double-digits this quarter, mainly driven by a disruption of our supply chain related to COVID-19. While orders reached a record high in March, fulfillment was challenged due to a shortage of labor at our third-party distributor in the face of the pandemic. Excluding the impact of the supply disruption, our strategic brands would have grown strongly. Lastly, turning to International, sales were up 11% for the quarter driven mainly by 60% volume growth as we saw very high demand from not just our cleaning and disinfecting products, but also our household essential household products. Growth was broad-based with double-digit volume increases in every single region. Sales were also impacted by unfavorable foreign currency headwinds of about 11%, partially offset by the benefits of pricing, which was implemented before the onset of the pandemic. With cleaning and disinfecting products accounting for more than half of the segment sales, expect consumer demand in International to remain elevated in the near-term. Now, I will turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss our Q3 financial performance and our updated outlook for FY 2020. Kevin Jacobsen : Thank you, Lisah and thank you everyone for joining us today, particularly during this difficult time. We hope you and your loved ones are well. I\u2019m extremely proud of the strong financial results we delivered this quarter as they reflect how our company responded so quickly to address an unprecedented demand for disinfecting products and our other trusted products people count on every day as they shelter in place during this global pandemic. The impact from COVID-19 had a significant impact on our third quarter results. At the same time, I am also encouraged by the continued progress we see in our core business prior to the increased sales as a result of COVID-19. In addition to our strong sales performance, we delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion and another quarter of strong cash flow. And as you saw in our press release, with this quarter\u2019s strong performance and our expectation for continued strong demand for our products in the fourth quarter, we have raised our fiscal year outlook, which I will discuss in a moment. Turning to our third quarter results, sales increased 15%, reflecting 18 points of volume growth, partially offset by two points of unfavorable foreign currency headwinds and one point of unfavorable price/mix. On an organic sales basis, third quarter sales grew 17%. Additionally, based on the trends we were seeing in the quarter prior to the impact of COVID-19, sales are tracking in line with our original plan to return to organic sales growth in the back half of the fiscal year. Gross margin for the quarter increased 330 basis points to 46.7% compared to 43.4% for the year ago quarter. Third quarter gross margin included the benefits of increased volume as well as 150 basis points from cost savings and 90 basis points from pricing, primarily in our international markets to offset inflation. These factors were partially offset by 70 basis points of higher trade spending, 60 basis points of unfavorable mix and assortment as well as 50 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. Third quarter gross margin also reflected ongoing cost favorability in commodities, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency headwinds. Additionally, while we did begin to incur costs late in the third quarter in our supply chain as a result of COVID-19, these costs will be more pronounced in our fourth quarter. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 15.1% compared to 13.9% in the year ago quarter. This higher rate primarily reflects higher year-over-year incentive compensation expense, consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. In addition to higher incentive compensation expense, it also includes donations we made to nonprofit organizations in support of COVID-19 relief. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at about 10% of sales or about equal to the year ago quarter. On an absolute basis spending increased about $23 million versus year ago quarter. Additionally, spending in our U.S. retail business came in at nearly 12% of sales. Importantly, we continue to invest in our brands and are not reducing investment levels during this period of heightened demand. Our third quarter effective tax rate was about 19% compared to about 22% in the year ago quarter due to higher excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation. Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share of $1.89 versus $1.44 in the year ago quarter, an increase of 31%. Turning to cash flow, at the end of Q3, year-to-date net cash provided by operations increased to $806 million from $603 million in the year ago period. The 34% year-over-year increase was primarily driven by lower working capital due to reduced inventory positions to support increased demand and profitable sales growth. Now I will turn to our fiscal year 2020 outlook, which we have updated and noted in our press release. Our fiscal year sales outlook is now expected to be in the range of 4% to 6% growth driven by increased demand for our products as a result of COVID-19. Our sales outlook also reflects our ongoing efforts to accelerate the sales momentum of our portfolio, fueled by strong customer plans, meaningful back half innovation programs and higher consumer investments, leading to increased distribution. Our updated sales outlook continues to assume about two points of foreign exchange headwinds. Our fiscal year organic sales outlook now assumes a range of 6% to 8% growth. Turning to gross margin, we now expect fiscal year gross margin to be up strongly or about 100 basis points, reflecting the continued benefit of operating leverage driven by our sales momentum, strong cost savings and favorable category mix as our Cleaning segment grows at an accelerated rate. This will be partially offset by temporary increased investments we are making within our production team in the form of increased wages and benefits as well as enhanced safety measures. In addition to investing in our team, we are incurring increased transportation and warehousing costs as we expedite shipments to our customers to support the heightened demand for our products. We estimate these temporary cost increases to negatively impact our fourth quarter gross margin by about 250 basis points. We continue to expect fiscal year advertising and sales promotion investment levels to be about 10% of sales. We now expect selling and administrative expenses to come in at about 15% of sales, reflecting anticipated higher incentive compensation, consistent with our commitment to our pay-for-performance philosophy. We now expect fiscal year EBIT margin to be up modestly, reflecting strong gross margin expansion, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses. We now expect our fiscal year effective tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22% due to higher excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation. Net of all these factors, we now expect fiscal year 2020 diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.70 to $6.90. While this range is wider than what we would normally provide at this time of year, we think the range is appropriate given the heightened volatility we are managing, which makes estimating our fourth quarter results more challenging as they will be influenced by a number of factors we don\u2019t directly control and are difficult to predict accurately at this time. Importantly, this outlook assumes minimal supply chain disruptions for the remainder of the fiscal year. Additionally, we have temporarily suspended both of our share repurchase programs. While the company maintains a very strong balance sheet and access to additional capital, we believe this is a prudent action to take while we further assess the environment and our capital allocation plans. Before I turn over to Benno, I would like to reinforce that I am pleased with the progress we continue to make on our base business. We have begun to rebuild distribution in the third quarter prior to the impact of COVID-19 and I expect that to continue this quarter. Additionally, we remain on track to deliver another strong year of cost savings and we continue to increase brand investment in support of our strong innovation program focused on improving consumer value. Additionally, I am pleased with our team\u2019s effort to significantly increase manufacturing production capacity while continuing to operate safely to help provide essential products needed during this global health crisis. We have made good progress to date and expect to continue to expand disinfection production capacity over the balance of the calendar year and beyond, supported by the resiliency of our supply chain. To-date, we have had no major disruptions, with all of our plants currently running and the vast majority of our contract manufacturers and suppliers continuing to operate. And finally, with accelerating revenue and cash flow, Clorox maintains a strong investment-grade balance sheet, giving the company plenty of financial flexibility. I believe Clorox is well positioned to manage through an economic recession while capitalizing on changing consumer behaviors as a result of this health crisis. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Benno. Benno Dorer : Thanks, Kevin. We appreciate all of you joining the call today. Our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted by this global health crisis and we hope that you and your families are safe and well. Clorox is a health and wellness company at heart. And during these past few months, our mission has never been clearer. In the uncharted territory presented by COVID-19, we knew it was important to act quickly to help, always grounded in our most important company value, do the right thing. We know that the public is counting on the Clorox Company and our products around the world, and our team of 8,800 strong is stepping up every day to make a difference the right way. With this in mind, here are the three important takeaways from today\u2019s call. First, I am proud of our people\u2019s leadership and passion in serving public health, which has been rewarded by our consumers, customers and the communities we serve and has led to strong Q3 financial results. Back in early January, we activated our company to guide our response to increased supply to protect public health and people and we have pursued three priorities since then front and center : first, protecting the health, safety and well-being of our employees; second, making cash and product contributions to support caregivers and other organizations providing coronavirus relief; and third, maximizing supply to get our products where they are needed most. In the U.S., our employees qualify as critical infrastructure workers, because we make essential household products. Our third quarter results reflect directly on the outstanding job our people are doing in the face of extraordinary circumstances and the health and well-being and that of our families is top of mind. To support those who continue to work in our facilities, we have enhanced our infection prevention measures with increased pay and added benefits for the frontline workers making our products. For our broader global team, we have established an initial $1 million employee relief fund to provide COVID-19 support to them and their families. For more than 100 years, the Clorox Company has helped communities in times of global health crisis and natural disasters. As we work with our communities to help support them in battling this crisis, we have now committed about $14 million in cash and product donations. In addition to our initial $5 million to support caregivers on the front lines, our additional support extends to organizations such as Feeding America and Americares as well as local organizations in the United States and internationally, helping to meet the needs of vulnerable populations in our communities. Clearly, we have faced extraordinary demand for our products, especially our disinfecting products. To try and meet demand to the greatest extent possible, we have been running our cleaning and disinfecting product plants 24/7. To increase output, we have accessed third-party supply sources focused on manufacturing of disinfecting products and those that can be supplied most quickly, and we\u2019ve been partnering with suppliers and retailers to get product where it is needed the most. In the United States in Q3, we supplied 40 million more disinfecting units for consumers and end users for an increase of more than 40% versus the year ago quarter. We are very grateful to our heroic production associates who made this possible. Additionally, we continue to find new ways to produce more disinfecting wipes and other products such as germicidal bleach for healthcare facilities. Importantly, we have zero tolerance for price gouging. And we want to ensure that everyone has access to our sanitizing and disinfecting products at standard prices at all times and especially now. As such, we have taken aggressive action to combat price gouging, including partnering with online retail platforms to identify and remove such offers or sellers in the third-party marketplace. As needed, we are collaborating with law enforcement agencies in connection with third-party price gouging increase regarding disinfecting products. More than ever, in an uncertain environment, people turn to trusted brands they can count on. And Clorox has the most trusted brands in many of the categories we compete in. And we see that reflected in strong market share performance and in rising household penetration on many of our U.S. brands. We also see it in strong double-digit sales growth, a sixth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion and a 31% diluted EPS growth this last quarter. My second message is I feel good about the progress we\u2019re making on our core business, which also contributed to our strong Q3 growth and is on track against our expectations for the back half. In Q3, before the impact of COVID-19, volume and sales growth trends were in line with expectations, and we were seeing the anticipated distribution gains. We were particularly pleased with the significant progress we were making on our Grilling business. Shared rents have been improving prior to the impact of COVID-19 and have accelerated since then. I am pleased that we grew share in six out of nine businesses in tracked channels. Our strong innovation program for the back half played a meaningful part in these improvements. In Grilling, we launched the new Kingsford hardwood pellets, which helped gain strong retailer traction for our 2020 grilling season plans and we will build distribution throughout the season. In Laundry, we started shipping our compacted bleach product, and we are very pleased with initiatives performance to date. Other innovations are off to promising starts, including a new platform of Clorox odor-eliminating fabric sanitizers and a new Glad Flex\u2019n Seal food storage bags that stretch around food to keep it fresh, which builds on a highly successful presence and innovation. One exception to our Q3 innovation plans was our new Clorox compostable cleaning wipes, which were off to a tremendous start. However, we made a deliberate choice to temporarily suspend their production in order to prioritize disinfecting wipes at this time. We will pick up on this initiative as soon as possible and remain very excited about its future prospects. What\u2019s important to understand is our business is performing well at its core. Prior to the impact of the pandemic, we were very pleased with the trends we were seeing in the majority of the business. We were rebuilding distribution, sales were strong and gross margin was continuing to expand. We expect those core trends to continue in the fourth quarter, even as we experience further impact from COVID-19. And my last point today is we remain confident that our strong portfolio, our IGNITE Strategy, our organization and our core capabilities will position us to pursue emerging opportunities and to manage through the expected near-term challenges to perform well and generate long-term shareholder value. As we are facing a period of volatility with the global economy now in economic recession, there are a number of external factors we\u2019re monitoring. COVID-19 will continue to impact global consumer behavior, future government actions and our supply chain, and it\u2019s difficult to predict the near-term future. With predictions that personal income will decline during the recession as unemployment rises, we anticipate discretionary spending will contract as consumers prioritize essentials. At the same time, we are seeing new households entering several of our categories, and we will invest strongly to turn many of them into loyal consumers. Most prominently, early indications are that the heightened awareness of the role disinfecting products play in public health brought about by this pandemic may be more lasting than following past global health crisis and will provide a meaningful long-term growth trend for our company. Clorox is the most trusted brand in the United States home care category with differentiated products fueled by a strong innovation program and our commitment to strongly invest in this business. We\u2019re optimistic about our future prospects given the elevated role disinfecting products will have in consumers\u2019 lives for the foreseeable future. Moreover, our portfolio has proven to be relatively recession resilient in the past as major Clorox categories like trash, grilling and food generally benefit from consumers eating out less as well as water filtration as consumers recognize the superior value of Brita filtered water when comparing to bottled water. The percentage of our U.S. portfolio that is seen by consumers as delivering superior value was at an all-time high level since we began using this measure, positioning our brands well as we enter this recession. We will remain keenly focused on consumer value through strong brand investments, meaningful innovation and adequate price gaps. And given our expanding margins and strong cash flow, backed by a strong portfolio, strategy and core capabilities, Clorox is uniquely positioned to play offense by leaning into investments in the long-term health of our business. As we manage through an unprecedented business environment near term, we remain committed to long-term value creation for our shareholders and all stakeholders, and we\u2019ll continue to be a purpose-driven business, committed to ESG and to doing the right thing. This core value of our company has served us well since 1913, and it has never been more important than now. Operator, you may now open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Dorer. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you and hope all is well and congrats on your results. So Benno, I was hoping if you can comment on your increasing production capacity into the fourth quarter. And I understand you were using third parties and using some of this capacity that you always had through peak season of cold and flu. So if you can comment on, obviously, in the sanitizing and in all your portfolio, which I understand is about 20% to 25%, and into the International, too, if you can keep that production. And in terms of consumption trends against shipments, if you can update us if you\u2019re still seeing a lot of demand from replenishing inventories at the shelf and also what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the grilling season for the other products you commented on the prepared remarks, but just to see if you can position us on the other portions of the portfolio? And then I have a follow-up on the gross margin, then I will pass it on. Benno Dorer : Yes. Thanks, Andrea. That\u2019s a lot of good ground to cover. And product supply, of course, is on everybody\u2019s mind. What we\u2019ve commented on is that demand has been clearly unprecedented, and we\u2019re in uncharted territory for our supply chain, in particular, in disinfecting products. Typically, if you think about supply chains, they\u2019re built to be in the sweet spot of quality, safety, efficiency, cost, effectiveness required to produce the necessary output for the long term. But when you have situations like we faced where, in March, we saw demand spikes for some of our disinfecting products of 500-plus percent, I think it\u2019s evident to everybody that despite heroic efforts, you have out of stocks. And clearly, we are continuing to see out of stocks. We\u2019re really proud of how our organization has responded. As Kevin commented, we haven\u2019t seen any major supply disruptions on our side. We have been able to increase our production of disinfecting products by 40%. We focused on fewer SKUs. We saw great partnership and patience from retailers, and I want to thank all of them for it to help us bring products to market as quickly as possible. We accepted incremental costs like air freighting, speeding up the supply chain to serve stores as quickly as possible. And as you commented, we activated third-party suppliers to help us cope with the surge in demand. We will continue to do that. We continue to find new ways to increase our capacity. We should see meaningful continued improvement this summer. And of course, we are also investing in the right capacity long term as we expect that demand for disinfecting products is going to be elevated for a long time as they will continue to play significantly increased role in people\u2019s lives. As we\u2019ve commented, we\u2019re seeing very little stockpiling. We\u2019re seeing a lot of use come from incremental households and in disinfecting, in particular. As you think about the future, as people stay home, they will want to protect themselves. At some point, when countries open up again, they will want to stay safe when they get out. And we have a lot of to-go products as well, in particular, with wipes. So that will continue to drive demand. Demand continues to be exorbitantly high. As you look at consumption data in tracked channels, it\u2019s very, very high. And of course, that doesn\u2019t factor in the fact that there\u2019s a lot of latent demand given the out-of-stocks, which as people see wipes in store, they grab them and they are pretty much sold out right away. And we\u2019re far from refilling customer inventories. Typically, customers keep about four weeks of inventory. So at some point, hopefully, we\u2019ll be able to also refill inventories, which will also give us an opportunity to keep selling a lot of wipes sometime in the future. As we said, in the U.S., wipes is or disinfecting products account for about one-fourth of our sales. It\u2019s definitely more right now, but we will see an elevation in demand for a while. We\u2019ve also commented that in International, that number is about 50% of our sales being in disinfecting products. And of course, we\u2019re seeing about the same dynamics there. So we feel like this is ongoing demand that we\u2019ll be able to serve. On many of our other product lines were on allocation as well given the spikes in demand. But we expect to come out of that this quarter, which will help us. And I feel like on our core business, the demand continues to be high. We made a lot of progress even before the pandemic, as we\u2019ve commented. But there are a number of product categories that see higher demand as consumers stay home. Grilling, of course, is one of them. We\u2019re really pleased with the progress on Grilling even before the pandemic as we made strong progress to engage retailers in our 2020 grilling season, and we were rewarded with much better plans. Clearly, as we think about Grilling, there\u2019s not a lot of merchandising happening right now, so we expect that to partially offset the growth that we\u2019re seeing. Memorial Day usually is a big grilling occasion, and I doubt that we will see a lot of merchandising at this point around Memorial Day, said that it\u2019s offset by a really strong base business. So in a nutshell, supply has been difficult. We have done extraordinary work to meet the demand as best as we can. We expect substantial improvements this summer, both in disinfecting as well as earlier, perhaps on our core business. And we\u2019re not seeing demand slowdown. If you think about the midpoint of our fiscal year sales outlook, which we\u2019ve increased to 4% to 6%, it still assumes a double-digit sales growth in Q4. So that tells you that we believe that elevated consumption is going to be around for a while. Andrea Teixeira : That\u2019s helpful, Benno. But if you if I can also ask on the gross margin point, but before we go into the gross margin, just even if you do the midpoint of your range, it sounds a little conservative to everything you\u2019ve just said. So I was wondering if it\u2019s just a level of being conservative at this point, just for the puts and takes and potentially retailers facing their own issues because it looks like as everything you\u2019ve said in the prepared remarks and now indicates that you can safely be at the top of that range or is it just like you\u2019re trying to be conservative given the uncertainty? Benno Dorer : Yes. We think we have a balanced outlook, Andrea. As you think about the range also, 4% to 6% with one quarter to go, and you can do the math, that implies a very wide range. Again, we think it\u2019s balanced. We think that there is a lot of uncertainty as far as the consumer is concerned. We\u2019re assuming that supply is not going to be disrupted, importantly. And as we learn more about asymptomatic cases, and the safety of our employees is very critical. And of course, for us, it\u2019s important to continue to be able to manufacture the way we have, but we can\u2019t take that for granted. So I would say, at this point, this is our best foot forward with a wide range, and it\u2019s a balanced outlook. And perhaps Kevin can comment on gross margin. Do you want to? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. The nature of the question, though. Did you have a question, Andrea, specifically related to gross margin? Andrea Teixeira : Yes. Yes. I appreciate the time. And just quickly on your point about 250 basis points, is that just the separate logistics impact or you are saying that we should be seeing it seems to me just an isolated impact and temporary? But obviously, it\u2019s the trend for gross margin, as we implied in the guidance, is up for the fourth quarter. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. So thank you for the question. On the 250 bps, we do believe that\u2019s temporary. It\u2019s really related to two items. We are investing more with our production team, as I mentioned, both in wages and benefits as well as enhanced cleaning measures. So that\u2019s part of it. As well as I think Benno just mentioned some of the specifics, the increased transportation, warehousing costs we\u2019re incurring. And I\u2019d say that\u2019s going to continue until we can catch up with the demand signal. So I\u2019d expect in the near term, that\u2019s something we\u2019ll see hitting margin. And we\u2019ll have to see how this plays out. That will be very much influenced by the shape of the demand. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Strycula from UBS. Steven Strycula : Hi. Good afternoon and congratulations on a very strong quarter. So Benno, I have a question as retailers have a newfound appreciation for some of the disinfectant strength that you guys have in your portfolio. How are your conversations going as retailers think about planning forward, maybe for fall, winter resets, in terms of the amount of linear display space for some of the disinfection products? And then as you think about your International business, given that COVID is a global pandemic situation, does this extend your portfolio reach and use maybe the wipes business as a foot forward into some markets where maybe you didn\u2019t have a strong presence previously? Benno Dorer : Yes, international first, Steve. So we do think that this gives us an opportunity to think about international expansion plans. And without getting into too much detail, we\u2019re certainly expecting that disinfecting, in general and perhaps wipes, in particular, are going to be seeing a lot of consumer demand. And this would give us an opportunity to serve more consumers. So it\u2019s something we certainly look at and something that, as we have no shortage of dry powder to invest in growth, we would be willing to invest in should there be profitable opportunities that we can take advantage of with an eye on sustainable competitive advantage. So we would probably not be interested in opportunistic market entries. But where we see a strategic long-term opportunity, we\u2019re certainly prepared to take advantage of it and we are seeing what you see on this. As far as retailer conversations, I will tell you that most of the conversations right now are about meeting the current demand, which is difficult enough. But what I would expect, of course, is that we\u2019re going to have those discussions with retailers at the right time. And they certainly see the numbers as we see them. It\u2019s a lot of incremental usage coming out of disinfecting products. The wipes household penetration sits a little north of 50%. Bleach is about the same. So and what we\u2019re seeing more recently is that the household penetration on those two categories is climbing. So that would suggest that there is an opportunity to expand shelf space in those two categories. But it\u2019s a conversation that still lies ahead of us, but it could certainly contribute to what we believe to be strong ongoing opportunities to serve more consumers with disinfecting products through the right amount of shelf space in store. Steven Strycula : Thank you. Benno Dorer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Hey, thanks. Good to hear your voices. Benno, just to build on your capacity planning comments and cleaning, as you think about getting ahead of the structural demand for disinfecting that you mentioned, not just in the U.S. in the near term but perhaps also over time overseas, how are you thinking about capacity builds against that backdrop? And should we begin to think of elevated CapEx associated with that or can this all be handled through third-party supply? Benno Dorer : I\u2019ll let Kevin comment on CapEx. But we are prepared to invest and, frankly, have started investing in more capacity in disinfecting with an eye on the long-term because of the anticipated demand. And it will be a mix, but typically, we, on an ongoing basis, always like to manufacture our products in-house because we can deliver the right combination of quality and cost. So I\u2019ll let Kevin give you his detailed perspective on how we should be thinking about CapEx. Kevin Jacobsen : Hi, Steve. As it relates to CapEx, typically, we spend about 3% of sales each year on CapEx. We\u2019re doing the work right now. But I suspect, as we look to fiscal year 2021, we\u2019ll be closer to 4%. And it\u2019s really for the reasons Benno just talked about. We see a number of opportunities to increase investments and expanding capacity of our self-manufacturing facilities because as I think you\u2019re hearing from us today, we\u2019re seeing heightened demand certainly in Q3 and our Q4. We expect this to continue over a longer term basis. And so we are leaning in right now to start increasing capacity, and we\u2019re investing right now to do that. Steve Powers : Okay, thank you. And then if I could just follow up real quick on the household business and Glad specifically. Clearly, a step back on the distribution loss in the third quarter. But if I heard you correctly, Lisah, I think you spoke of net wins as of the fourth quarter. So I guess net of all the moving parts, how should we think about your shipments relative to takeaway in the fourth quarter and beyond as everything settles out across the market based on that? Thanks. Benno Dorer : Yes. So first of all, I will say that this distribution loss which occurred was contemplated in the previous outlook. So it\u2019s not a change to the previous outlook. We knew this for a while. And as we think about by quarter, it\u2019s simply a timing saying, so we lost this in Q3. But for the total back half of the fiscal year, as Lisah has commented, we expect distribution points to be up because we will get significant wins with other customers, including new distribution with significant customers. So it\u2019s a net positive. And what we expect is, for the midterm, this business should do quite well given that it\u2019s also positively impacted by the pandemic as people stay home more. But we\u2019re also, as you will have seen, growing share market share quite significantly as a result of not just the improved distribution position but also some spillover from the lost distribution. We know that some Glad consumers are willing to change stores to buy their brands. And of course, the core fundamentals, as we think about innovation, as we think about price gaps, which we have continued to invest in, continue to improve. So we\u2019re comfortable with where Glad is and the path forward on the business. Steve Powers : Yes, okay. I just want to make sure I hear I mean my impression based on all that is that we should think about shipments coming in ahead of wherever consumption lands in the fourth quarter. But before I walk away with that, I just want to test that hypothesis with you. Benno Dorer : Yes. So we always try to stay away from being that specific on any business forward-looking, so bear with us at this point. You will continue to see the negative impact of the loss distribution for a while, right? But that will be partially offset by or it will be offset by the distribution gains that we\u2019re adding. So it\u2019s going to be a little bit noisy for a quarter or two, but it will normalize after that period of time. Steve Powers : Okay, fair enough. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi from RBC. Nik Modi : Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. I hope everyone is doing well. Benno, I\u2019m curious how you would think about answering this question because I\u2019ve been thinking about it a lot. There\u2019s just so much trial. I mean how much marketing do you think sorry. How many marketing dollars do you think Clorox would have had to spend in order to get the kind of top line that you have right now? And the reason why I ask that question is this seems, I hope, like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity where so many consumers are trying these brands and some for the first time across a wide ring of demographics. And how you can spend or lean into that to really engage them to create the stickiness. Now I know everyone is more focused on disinfecting, but I\u2019m talking also about charcoal and your other products, salad dressing, etcetera. So I don\u2019t know how you want to approach that question, but I\u2019m just curious, like how much do you think how much value was created by this situation across your portfolio? Benno Dorer : So we are not going to be a company that\u2019s going to cut advertising. For us, advertising is a long-term investment. And as you say, we have a unique opportunity now to turn trial into loyal users. One of our IGNITE Strategies, as you probably recall, is to increase the number of people we have a close personal relationship with in the United States from 20 million to 100 million people over the next five years. Now we\u2019re getting a lot of incremental people in, and it\u2019s our opportunity to hold on to that volume. So in the back half of this fiscal year, we will spend $50 million, 5-0, more than in the previous year. And that tells you the stance that we are taking. We will play offense. We think that advertising investment is a very good investment. Clearly, the ROIs, in theory, they\u2019re a little lower right now than they would be if we didn\u2019t have out of stocks. But the ROIs are still very good. And we\u2019re not spending to make quarter commitments, but we\u2019re spending to build the long-term equity of our brands. How we spend is different. For instance, as you think about our disinfecting products, we\u2019re trying to be useful in people\u2019s lives. We\u2019re trying to live the purpose that we have created for the Clorox brand. And in this particular case, we are spending a lot of money on consumer education, in making sure that people use our brands the right way and in helping them be safe. That is a great investment because at this time, brands need to show up. And at this time, people make up their minds as to whether they trust the brands or not. And for Clorox, we believe that it\u2019s a unique opportunity to continue to build trust in our brands, to hold on to the increased trial that we are seeing. And as a result, we will be very bullish with our advertising spend and not cut any single dollars. Like I said, we\u2019re spending $50 million more in the back half. And I would expect us to continue to spend quite strongly in the next fiscal year as well. Nik Modi : Very helpful. And then if I could, just a quick question on the Glad distribution loss. I know you\u2019ve already budgeted for it, but can you just talk a little bit what was driving the distribution loss? Like what happened? Benno Dorer : We typically don\u2019t do that. It\u2019s a discussion that happens between a retailer and the manufacturer. So I\u2019d prefer not to comment as in all cases, just to protect the integrity of the conversations that we have with retailers. But it\u2019s a good retailer. It\u2019s a good partner of ours. We\u2019re growing very strongly with them in other parts of the portfolio. And we\u2019re also optimistic perhaps that at some point, we can have a different kind of conversation in this category with the same customer as we might have had in previous categories. So respect their decision, don\u2019t agree with the decision, we\u2019ll have to see how it works for them. And in the meantime, we\u2019re very comfortable with where we are on Glad and our plans on the business going forward. Nik Modi : Fair enough. Thank you, Benno. Benno Dorer : Thanks, Nik. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. And I hope that you\u2019re doing well. I wanted to pick up, Benno, if we could, on the topic of disinfectants and hygiene products but bring it to the company\u2019s long-term guidance. So as you are well aware, there\u2019s a lot of pushback on these calls, I think, for a number of years on your prior guidance, the 3% to 5% organic sales growth and the achievability of it. And so it was just this past October, as you guys are well aware, that you trimmed it down to 2% to 4%. And now just building on the discussion in terms of increased consumer demand in some of your big product categories like disinfectants, it seems like this is certainly going to be more lasting. You\u2019re seeing an increase in household penetration, you\u2019re increasing capacity. So clearly, that\u2019s a view that you guys share as well. But I was just hoping that you could comment, maybe you could quantify this a bit in terms of what you see as the appropriate long-term algorithm now for the company getting beyond this period of pantry load and so forth. But over the next three to five years, is 3% to 5%, again, more relevant? If so, where do you think is sort of appropriate as you guys are planning within that range? So thanks for that. Benno Dorer : So I think you will understand how we\u2019re not going to give any numbers or any updated view on our long-term sales guidance. Like we said, we think that there\u2019s going to be continued heightened consumer engagement, and that gives us an opportunity to serve more consumers in the U.S. and international. At the same time, I\u2019d also expect that it\u2019s going to be a more competitive space. As you know, we always worry about competition, and this is going to be an attractive category. And we will have to see what happens to the competitive landscape in the future. And then, of course, there\u2019s other puts and takes, right? So if I think about Burt\u2019s Bees right now, which, as you all know, has been an incredible success story for the company for a very long time, and we expect that to pick up at some point. But personal care businesses, in particular, are challenged. So I think there\u2019s going to be puts and takes. We\u2019re certainly thinking about what the right algorithm might be. We are having the right conversations internally. And at the right time, if we believe there\u2019s a change, we\u2019ll communicate it. Now is not that time. We\u2019re comfortable with the 2% to 4%. Near term, like we said in our fiscal year outlook, we expect elevated demand, but it\u2019s way too early to say how this will translate into long-term value creation. The important thing to take away, though, beyond the numbers is that we will aggressively invest into it. We will play offense, and we will put ourselves in the best possible position in the retail and the professional business to serve as many consumers and institutional customers as we possibly can. And then we\u2019ll see what comes out of that. Kevin Grundy : Okay, thanks Ben. I will pass it on. Good luck guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney : Good morning and thanks very much. And appreciate your leadership in all of this. Kevin, you gave us a couple of figures, and just a simplistic question. Can you tell us what either global takeaway was or U.S. takeaway was as far as you can? I\u2019m just trying to understand what that will mean when we come to model next year and try to compare and see how this big surge of volume sort of smooths out over a few quarters. And secondly, on the cost front, it strikes me that your cost structure looking over the next year, so 12 months from now, not the rest of the fiscal year, which is probably pretty fixed, is pretty petro heavy. And can you give me a sense how much that is that right? And how much your sort of prospective look at those sorts of input costs has come down since, say, the past say, maybe January 1 when some changes in the price of energy and some of these upstream components? Thanks very much. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. Thanks, Jonathan. On the second question related to our cost inputs, you see the same data we see, which, clearly, there\u2019s a significant pullback in the price of oil. But we\u2019re also seeing that in the resin market. But I\u2019d tell you to a much lesser degree because I think there\u2019s some structural issues going on in oil, it\u2019s going to get to pull back much further. I would say this. I think a lot of that is going to be driven by global demand more so than input costs. With GDP globally continue to decline, I think that will continue to put downward pressure on cost inputs, particularly in the energy complex. And for us, that really plays out in a couple of areas. So obviously, for us, resin is a big component of our buy, and that\u2019s most pronounced on our Glad business. Keep in mind, though, in Glad, as we see cost inputs coming down on resin, typically, that means heightened trade spending within the category. And that\u2019s really how the category is managed, that, that flows through to consumers through the form of increased trade. So as resin prices come down, I would expect to see increased trade spending on the Bags and Wraps business across the categories. And then as it relates to oil, oil usually takes six months or so to work through our supply chain. So if oil stays down at these levels, this $20 a barrel level it looks like it\u2019s projecting over the next few months, that certainly would be a tailwind for us going out for the foreseeable future. Now I think it\u2019s probably too early to know that for sure. But certainly, if you look at the environment today, it certainly suggests that\u2019s possible. And then, Jonathan, say more on your global takeaway. Tell me more what you\u2019re looking for in that question. Jonathan Feeney : Pretty simple. Whenever you told about we know what U.S. takeaway is or at least your measured channels. You told us that club and e-com was something like double that rate. I assume that\u2019s just a U.S. number. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us if you think about global takeaway through retail, like how as it compares to your total global sales number or the U.S. version of that, just an actual number as opposed to double the rate, etc. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. I mean I\u2019d say a few things. As we\u2019ve talked, our volume growth is about 18% as a company. And International, we had very strong volume growth as well, very close to that. So our International business is growing at a fairly comparable rate to what we\u2019re seeing in the U.S. And again, because of what we talked about, this is a global health crisis, and we have an international portfolio that\u2019s very lined up to address this and help consumers. And so we\u2019re seeing strong growth broadly. As I think about tracked versus non-tracked, we are seeing elevated growth in non-tracked channels. It\u2019s probably growing 10-plus points higher than tracked right now. But I think that\u2019s also not surprising. We\u2019re seeing very strong growth in e-com, and we\u2019re seeing very strong growth in club as consumers are even ordering from home or they\u2019re trying to order in larger quantities. So we\u2019re seeing those channels grow at an accelerated rate right now. Jonathan Feeney : Okay. That helps a lot. Thank you very much. Kevin Jacobsen : Thanks, Jonathan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks, and good afternoon. I just wanted to ask a little about the commercial environment because I would expect and hope that there\u2019s some pullback on promotional activity with demand trending so high. Promotion was still mentioned in the release, and the Nielsen data is sort of a bit of a mixed bag, and I know that\u2019s always the best picture. So wondering if we can hit off on that promotional environment, I guess, within the cleaning categories and then your other businesses would be great. Benno Dorer : Hey Lauren as you might expect, given the supply shortages, there aren\u2019t a lot of promotions, and we expect that there won\u2019t be for the rest of the fiscal year. Said that, the way we accrue promotions is less of invoice, but most of our promotional dollars are reflected in everyday low pricing with most of our customers. And we also have a performance-based annual program where a lot of the promotional dollars are being spent. So the fact that there isn\u2019t a lot of promotions given that EDLP is where it\u2019s always been and given that retailers are more than meeting our performance requirements, the trade dollars are continuing to be spent. And we don\u2019t expect that, nor frankly do we necessarily want it to be a source of savings. We have continued to spend against the right price gaps on Glad. And as you can see from market share gains and also pricing developments, we\u2019re continuing to make progress, and we feel good about that. So promotional environments, pretty benign. Expect that to continue, but it will not translate to cost savings. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. So the investments in the trade dollars and adjusting price points that\u2019s something that is still ongoing. We just don\u2019t see it manifest as like promotion in store. But ultimately, it will show up as like a permanent list price change, for example, for Glad. Benno Dorer : I\u2019m not saying that. All I\u2019m saying is that we\u2019re continuing to spend the dollars. We\u2019re not pulling back on any dollars in any area. And in Glad, we are spending against a very specific objective, and that is to temporarily keep up pricing in line. What happens with that spend and whether it\u2019s going to, at some point, be converted to a different list price will very much depend on what competition is doing, and that\u2019s out of our control. Right now, we are comfortable spending the dollars in trade, and it\u2019s working. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Great. And then I was curious with the Professional Products business because that\u2019s obviously been an area of interest for you guys for some time. And I feel like there were some fits and starts in really getting that business to grow as it was sort of hoped maybe at least not now, but five or seven years ago. So where that clearly is an opportunity in terms of usage, but just in terms of, call it, account wins or sales force investments, things like that, that you can do, it maybe early to talk about, but I was just curious about longer-range investments to continue supporting the growth of that business in a more contractual level rather than just right now meeting the surge in absolute need. Benno Dorer : Yes, absolutely. That\u2019s part of the broader disinfecting opportunity, Lauren. The Professional business, or PPD, as we call it, has done very well for us for a prolonged period of time. And the core of the business, which is to serve hospitals and other healthcare facilities with disinfecting products, has always done well. What we have done in the past was to look at whether we can enter additional categories. Some of it was successful and still is. Some of it was not mostly because the regulatory environment has changed quite significantly. But the core of the professional business is serving healthcare facilities with disinfecting products, and we have a number of proprietary and unique technologies. We have germicidal wipes, of course, which can help a great deal at this point. But also our total 360 electrostatic sprayer system is seeing an incredible uptick in demand that this fiscal year will be up 500% from last year, and we continue to see an opportunity to drive distribution. So what you can expect is that we will continue to invest very aggressively in strategic opportunities that are centered around areas where the Clorox brand matters, which it does; where we have unique technology, which is predominantly in the healthcare space; and where our know-how in cleaning and disinfecting protocols can come into play. Importantly, we look at these options increasingly, not just as options that are limited to the Professional business but where we can bring the full power of the total company into play. And that will increasingly involve ways to reassure consumers that certain places are cleaned with the Clorox brand as a way to make them feel safe as, at some point, hopefully, we will be all back to normal and enjoying the things outside our homes that we used to enjoy and look forward to. Lauren Lieberman : Thank you, Benno. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong from Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Thanks. Good afternoon. And hope everyone is well. We\u2019ve covered a lot of ground, cleaning, disinfecting already. So maybe I can ask one about just private label and how to think about what potentially happens in some of your more private label exposed categories outside of cleaning, of course, as we think about the recession taking hold. What are you doing to stay focused in this in these categories as we emerge out of the pandemic? Thanks. Benno Dorer : Yes. So right now, I would say market share is driven by two things. First of all, just sheer availability, right? And as you think about our disinfecting products, for instance, one of the strategic choices, as hard as it may be, but whether you\u2019re doing the right thing isn\u2019t necessarily just determined by your words, but it\u2019s determined by actions. And one thing we are doing is we\u2019re prioritizing the healthcare section. That leads to more out-of-stocks at retail and it leads could lead to lower shares. And that is okay because that is the right thing to do. That could mean that private label in disinfecting could grow share. Said that, what we\u2019re seeing also is that at the time of crisis, people turn to brands that they trust. And we have many of those brands that people trust. And if you look at tracked channels to date, what\u2019s been happening is that we grow share very strongly, six out of nine categories in tracked channels. We\u2019re seeing one category also growing non-tracked channels, so it\u2019s 7 out of 9 in non-tracked channels. And we\u2019re seeing private label and what we might casually call secondary brands or all other brands decline, all other brands declined very heavily. That is the fact, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing right now. And for us, as we have entered the recession, there are a number of things that we\u2019re bullish about. First of all, the fact that brands do matter, and we have many of the brands that people care about. Second, as I said earlier, the percentage of our brands that is seen by consumers in the U.S. as superior in value is at an all-time high. And if you think about this recession and compare it to the 2008, 2009 recession, that recession was prior to our focus on consumer value. Our focus on consumer value started with our Strategy 2020, which was put in place in 2013. And since then, the percentage of our volume, of our NCS that\u2019s seen as better in value is up significantly. If you add to that our commitment to play offense, if you add to that our ability to invest in the consumer, if you add to that a portfolio that\u2019s relatively recession resistant, several categories typically do quite well during a time of recession. If you then finally add to that our commitment to keep innovating and our expected continued strong innovation plan, we feel like we\u2019re entering the recession with momentum, and we expect that we will do quite well with consumers. And we\u2019re always taking private label seriously, but we like where we stand at this point. Olivia Tong : Great. Thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. Benno, I would now turn the program back over to you. Benno Dorer : Yes, thank you all of you. I look forward to speaking with you again in August when we will share our Q4 and fiscal year 2020 results. And in the meantime, please stay safe and well. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. Lisah Burhan : Thanks, Hillary. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining us today. We hope you and your family are safe and well. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, our Chair and CEO; Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO; and Linda Rendle, our President and CEO-Elect. Before we go through our Q4 and full year results, I'd like to turn it over to Benno to say a few words about the leadership changes announced today. Benno? Benno Dorer : Thank you, Lisa, and hello everyone. You've likely seen this morning's announcement about my decision to step down from my role as CEO. With our current President, Linda Rendle, being named my successor, effective September 14. I will continue to serve as Executive Chair of the Board. It has been my great privilege to carry forward the legacy of generations of strong Clorox leaders in my pursuit of Good Growth. Growth that is profitable, sustainable and responsible. The idea of Good Growth was created based on the very strong belief, that companies can deliver great results the right way, and that's serving employees, communities and the planet as a whole is as important as serving shareholders, and that's how we generate profit matters. I am proud that as a company, we have always been strategy led and committed to our values, both of which have guided us successfully in making the right choices on behalf of our shareholders and all of our stakeholders. After 15 terrific years at the company, I am particularly grateful for my teams of 8,800 strong, and especially for the current executive team. I have great confidence in them. I also want to thank the Board of Directors for their support of a guy who ventured out of a small town in the German Black forest, 35 years ago to pursue a dream that let me to places and allowed me to do things I could not have possibly imagined. My thanks also go out to everyone in the investment community around the world for your support, helpful perspective and of course, your candor, which I look forward to momentarily. I appreciate all of you, and I particularly appreciate the wonderful friendships that I've been able to make along the way. On September 14, I could not be more pleased to hand over the reins to Linda and I look forward to supporting her and her team. I've worked with Linda for 13 of her 17 years with the company. She is an exceptional leader, with an outstanding track record, the right leader for this great company and I cannot wait for all of you to be able to see what she can do. Linda is joining us today and will participate in Q&A and also say a few words towards the end of the call. Thank you. It's been an honor and a privilege. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Lisah. Lisah Burhan : Thanks, Benno. I've really enjoyed working with you since I started at Clorox on the Glad business more than 15 years ago. And I look forward to working closely with Linda as well. A few reminders before we go into results. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected or potential impact of COVID-19. These statements are based on management's current expectation, but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identify various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements and the non-GAAP financial information section, including the tables that reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, both of which are located at the end of today's earnings release, which has also been posted on our website and filed with the SEC. Turning to today's discussion of our results. I'll start by covering our top line commentary as usual, with highlights in each of our segments. Kevin will then address our financial results as well as outlook for the fiscal year 2021. Finally Benno will offer his perspective and we'll close with Q&A. For the total company, Q4 sales increased 22%, reflecting double-digit growth in all four reportable segments. Full year sales were up 8%. I'll now go through our results by segment. As you may have seen in our press release, we have made some changes to our reportable segments with a newly formed Health and Wellness segment replacing our Cleaning segment, and the realignment of several business units. In our health and -- Health and Wellness segment, Q4 sales were up 33% for the quarter and full year sales grew 14%. Cleaning which merges Home Care and Laundry is our largest business unit in the company representing about 30% of total company sales in FY '20. The business had another quarter of double-digit sales growth behind continued elevated demand across the portfolio. While we've been able to add significant capacity, demand still far exceeds supply, leading to continued out of stocks for many products. This coupled with our focus on assortment simplification to increase output and our prioritization of Healthcare facilities is impacting our market share and distribution points especially in tracked channels. We expect to improve our share of assortment over time as we expand production. On a full year basis Cleaning sales also grew by double-digits behind a very strong back half performance. Our data continues to show that the majority of sales increased we've seen since March has been from new users, leading to an unprecedented growth in household penetration for the Clorox brand. We're excited to continue to drive our categories and maintain momentum by increasing our investments in brand building and innovation. However, our most urgent priority remains to continue aggressively expanding our production capacity to meet consumer demand, which we anticipate will remain elevated for some time. These investments support our IGNITE Strategy to strengthen our core and continue to leverage the Health and Wellness megatrend at a time when our brands are more relevant than ever. Our Professional products business, making up about 7% of total company sales in FY '20, also has double-digit sales growth for -- in Q4, supported by strong shipments across all of our disinfecting platforms. Full year sales also grew by double-digits, fueled by an exceptional performance in the back half. As a reminder, the main source of revenue for our professional products comes from providing commercial cleaning and disinfecting solutions to both the health care and janitorial channels. Our broad range of solutions include platform such as the Clorox Total 360 system, which uses an electrostatic technology to deliver disinfectants to large hard-to-reach areas as well as Clorox germicidal bleach, Clorox hydrogen peroxide disinfecting cleaners and Clorox disinfecting wipes. We believe our brands has broader reach beyond the channels we're in today, and that this business will continue to have significant growth opportunities. We're proud that our products can help support public health and we're excited about the recent strategic partnerships we've established with Uber Technologies, United Airlines, AMC Theaters and Cleveland Clinic. Lastly, within the Health and Wellness segment, our Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements business combined RenewLife and Nutranext representing about 4% of the total company sales in FY 20. Sales in our VMS business decreased by double-digits this quarter. There were two main drivers for the decline. First, our Neutranext brands continue to experience a supply disruption related to COVID-19 in a third-party fulfillment center that prevented us from meeting what has been a healthy demand. We're currently transitioning to a new provider and expect the situation to be fully resolved in the fall. Second, Renewlife based ongoing category and competitive challenges. Looking forward, our full brand relaunch remains on track for FY '21, and we're continuing to work on partnering with retailers to reinvigorate the category. Full year sales for the VMS business also declined double-digits due to similar drivers as in Q4. Turning to the Household segment. Q4 sales were up 17%, reflecting growth across all three businesses, and full year sales grew 1%. Glad sales were up by double-digits in Q4, behind strong demands for our products as consumers continue to stay at home. We're also pleased to see share growth in our Glad trash bag segment, driven mainly by strong innovation. We launched a new experiential Glad ForceFlex Trash Bags featuring unique fragrances and colors in Q3 and early reception has been positive. For the full year, Glad sales grew slightly, reflecting sequential improvement throughout the year, ending with a very strong Q4. We're focused on building on this momentum and investing further behind our differentiated platform with more innovation plan for FY '21. Grilling sales grew by double-digits in Q4, fueled by strong consumption both due to increased grilling occasion among existing users as well as new users entering the category. We're also pleased to see share and household penetration growth this quarter, supported by our new Kingsford strategy. Collaboration with our retail partners has been strong and growth this quarter was broad based. Our Q4 performance was especially notable, because it was delivered without aggressive holiday price discounting during the peak Grilling season. The Kingsford pellet innovation continues to build distribution and share, and we're excited to lean in further to invest in long-term profitable category growth. For the full year, we saw solid sales growth as our efforts to turnaround the business started to bear fruit and consumption increased strongly in the back half. Cat Litter sales grew in Q4, driven by innovation and strong online shipments, partially offset by lower consumption in traditional channels following consumer pantry loading that we saw last quarter. For the full year, Litter sales grew behind strong back half performance, partially offset by a more challenging, front half performance as we lap the initial pipeline shipments of Fresh Step Clean Paws. Clean Paws continue to perform very well, with strong growth in its third year after launch and we'll keep investing in this innovation platform in FY '21. We're also encouraged by the strong start of Fresh Step gain original scented litter with the a power for Breeze, which just launched in June. In our Lifestyle segment, sales grew 16% and full year sales grew 10%. Brita sales were up by double-digits in Q4, behind continued elevated consumption of our water filtration systems and filters. This unprecedented level of demand started in Q3 and continued in Q4, resulting in out-of-stocks that impacted our share this quarter. Full year sales also grew by double-digits, reflecting healthy momentum in the first half and heightened consumption in the back half. We're encouraged by the fact that the majority of its recent sales have come from new household, just like what we see -- what we've been seeing in many of our other categories. Our priorities going forward will be to increase supply. Convert these new users to loyal consumers and continue to support our brand with a focus message around Brita's value proposition during this recession. The Food business saw a double-digit sales growth in Q4, mainly behind very strong consumption of Hidden Valley Ranch bottle dressing benefiting from more at-home eating occasions. The brand grew share for the 22nd consecutive quarter and increased household penetration. Full year sales increased behind solid growth in the first half and elevated consumption in the back half. We'll continue to invest to drive brand awareness and trial behind our innovation and capitalize on this momentum as consumers are eating at home over an extended period of time, especially during the recession. Burt's Bees sales were down by double-digits this quarter, as the overall category consumption was negatively impacted by ongoing store closures and stay-at-home measures. Regardless of the decline in Q4, this business had solid sales growth for the full year, reflecting strong growth behind innovation and enhanced leadership in lip balm. In Lip Care, Burt's Bees grew share for the 22nd consecutive quarter and widened its market leadership status as the number one overall lip balm in the US. While we expect the category wide challenges to persist in the short-term, consumer preferences for natural products and more specifically Burt's Bees remain unchanged. And we're confident in the brand's long-term growth trajectory. Our FY '21 plan includes a robust innovation line up, including a new squeezy lip color lines that launched in July and CBD personal care products launching in the fall. Lastly, turning to International. Q4 sales grew 12%, mainly driven by continued elevated demand for our cleaning and disinfecting products as well as essential household products. Sales were also impacted by unfavorable foreign currency headwinds of about 12%, partially offset by the benefits of pricing that was implemented before the onset of the pandemic. For the full year, sales were up 5%, reflecting about 10 points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Additionally, it's worth noting that profit for International was down this quarter due to costs associated with the product we call improved [ph]. Like other businesses, where there has been increases in household penetration during this period, we'll be focused on converting those new households into loyal consumers. We're also continuing to explore international opportunities and today announced the acquisition of a majority stake in our long-standing joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In its long 50-year history, this business has offered consumers in the Gulf region, a range of cleaning and disinfecting products. During that time, they have shown not only steady growth, but also strong profitability. Consistent with our IGNITE Strategy goal, this acquisition will help drive long-term profitable growth in our international segment. Now, I'll turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss our Q4 and full year financial performance for FY '20 as well as our outlook for FY '21. Kevin Jacobsen : Thank you, Lisah. And thank you everyone for joining us today. We hope you and your families are well. I'm proud of a very strong performance in Q4 and our overall results for fiscal year '20. As we continue to navigate the global pandemic, our team has been unwavering in our efforts to maximize supply disinfectants and other essential products needed by Healthcare workers, consumers and our communities. In the fourth quarter, COVID-19 continued to have a significant impact on our results. In addition to double-digit sales growth in all four of our reportable segments, we delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion and another quarter of strong cash flow, all of which contributed to strong fiscal year '20 performance. As you saw in our press release, we are providing a financial outlook today, because, despite the increased challenge of anticipating how the full year will play out, we believe that in this period of heightened uncertainty, it's important to provide investors with as much transparency and perspective as possible. That said, we anticipate a higher level of variability than what you might normally expect, as the results will be heavily influenced by the depth and the duration of the ongoing health crisis. I'll comment more on our outlook shortly. Turning to our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter sales were up 22%, driven by 21 points of volume growth and 3 points of favorable price mix, partially offset by 2 points of FX headwinds. Gross margin for the quarter, increased 170 basis points to 46.8% compared to 45.1% for the year ago quarter. Fourth quarter gross margin included the benefits of higher volume as well as 170 basis points from cost savings, and 120 basis points from favorable mix. These factors were partially offset by higher manufacturing and logistics cost which included temporary spending related to increasing our production capacity and expediting transportation of our products. Fourth quarter gross margin also reflected ongoing cost favorability in commodities, more than offset by the impact from foreign currency headwinds. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 14.1% compared to 13.3% in the year ago quarter. This higher rate primarily reflects increased year-over-year incentive compensation, consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at about 11%, about 0.5 point higher than the year ago quarter. We're spending for our US retail business coming in at about 12% of sales for the second consecutive quarter. For additional perspective, we invested $70 million more in the back half of fiscal year '20, compared to the same period in fiscal year '19, reflecting aggressive investments consistent with our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was about 22% compared to about 17% in the year ago quarter, due to lapping tax benefits in the year ago period. Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share of $2.41 versus $1.88 in the year ago quarter, an increase of 28%. Commenting briefly on our fiscal year results, I'm pleased with the progress we made in our core business prior to the impact of COVID-19, plus our teams dedication to respond to unprecedented demand resulting in very strong results for fiscal year '20. We delivered sales growth of 8% and on our organic basis grew sales 10%. Gross margin expansion of 170 basis points versus fiscal year '19, supported by strong volume growth and another year of robust cost savings. These factors enabled us to close out the overall fiscal year delivering diluted EPS of $7.36, an increase of 16%. As you saw in our press release, fiscal year '20 net cash provided by operations was $1.5 billion versus $992 million in fiscal year '19, an increase of 56%. Our accelerating cash flow and strong balance sheet, give us the flexibility to continue investing behind long-term growth opportunities. Now I'll provide more perspective on our outlook. Starting with our key assumptions for fiscal year '21. First, we expect the impact of COVID-19 to be with us for the bulk of fiscal year '21 resulting in our expectation for ongoing elevated global demand for our Cleaning and Disinfecting products, particularly through the first half of our fiscal year, Next, we expect the US and many parts of the world to face an ongoing recession that will reduce consumers' disposable spending and increase the importance of providing superior consumer value. And we plan to aggressively invest behind the momentum we're seeing in our global portfolio, including increasing production capacity to address ongoing elevated demand for our products. Our outlook also assumes minimal disruption through extended supply chain over the course of the fiscal year. And finally, we are assuming about a 40% devaluation of the Argentine peso which is materially less than the potential devaluation if the currency moves to the country's parallel rate. For our fiscal year sales outlook. We expect fiscal year sales to be flat to up low-single-digits, reflecting our expectation for continued elevated demand for the first half of the fiscal year and a deceleration in the back half as we lap the initial spike in demand from COVID-19. As you saw in our press release, we have acquired a majority stake in our Saudi Arabia joint venture, which we anticipate will contribute about 1 point of growth to our fiscal year '21 sales. We expect this to be offset by about 1 point of foreign exchange headwinds primarily in Argentina. On an organic sales basis, our outlook assumes flat to low single-digit growth. For additional perspective on our fiscal year sales expectations, we anticipate strong growth in the front half of the fiscal year, including double-digit increases in Q1, although decelerating from the 19% sales growth we delivered in the back half of fiscal year 20. In the back half of fiscal year 21, while we expect strong performance relative to our pre-pandemic sales levels, we expect sales to decline as we lapped the initial impact from COVID-19 in the year ago period. We expect fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to come in at about 14% of sales as we continue to invest aggressively in long-term growth initiatives. Additionally, we are increasing investments in our brands to address this unprecedented demand for our products from existing and new consumers with plans to increase advertising spending to about 11% of sales, to build loyalty with many new consumers entering our categories for the first time, in addition to continuing to deliver superior consumer value, which is more critical than ever as we navigate the global recession. As I mentioned, we will continue to invest in expanding our production capacity to address our expectation for ongoing elevated demand for our products and support new longer term growth opportunities. In the near term, we will continue to expand our use of third-party manufacturers to increase our production capacity, while this comes at a higher cost we believe is an important action to take while our internal expansion efforts come online. We expect our fiscal year tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23%, closer to our long-term tax rate assumption. Net of these factors, we expect fiscal year '21 diluted EPS to be down mid-single-digits to up mid-single-digits. Our fiscal year diluted EPS outlook includes an estimated contribution of $0.45 to $0.53 from our increased stake in our Saudi Arabia joint venture, primarily driven by a one-time non-cash gain associated with a fair market value adjustment to our previously held stake in the joint venture. This one-time gain is projected to be recognized in Q1 and on a full year basis offset by our expectations for a high tax rate and foreign currency headwinds for the company. Before I turn it over to Benno, I'd like to reiterate how proud I am of the Clorox team for delivering strong performance in fiscal year '20 and the role we're playing to help fight this global pandemic. Our Disinfecting products continue to support public health and other essential products continue to make a difference in the day-to-day lives of people as they spend more time at home. Consumer interest in our categories has never been higher. And a robust fiscal year sales results, provide a strong foundation for ongoing momentum. We certainly plan to build on that by aggressively investing in our IGNITE Strategy to drive long-term shareholder value. And finally, I also want to say how much I've enjoyed working with Benno over the years. I'm also looking forward to Clorox' next chapter with Linda, who will be a strong CEO for the company. And with that, I'll turn it over to Benno. Benno Dorer : Thanks, Kevin. Here are my three key messages for our Q4 and fiscal year '20 results. First, I continue to be proud of our people's leadership and commitment to serving public health and supporting our consumers and communities during this global health crisis. The dedication has led to outstanding Q4 results, contributing to very strong performance in fiscal year '20. I'm pleased we delivered fiscal year 2020 sales growth of 8% reflecting growth in all reportable segments and organic sales were up 24% [ph], our highest organic sales growth on record. We also delivered totally company gross margin expansion reflecting gross margin increases in all four segments for the fiscal year, supported by the strength of our volume results and robust cost savings. And even with significant advertising investments, we were able to expand fiscal year EBIT margin by 110 basis points. And we delivered a 16% increase in diluted earnings per share for fiscal year '20. While our financials for the quarter and full year were very strong, there's one area of ongoing focus for us, keeping up with continued elevated demand. We take very seriously the important role we play in this pandemic [indiscernible] and customers are counting on all our products. Frankly, we thought we would be in a better position by now, but demand in Q4 exceeded our expectations. We're certainly not at all happy with our service levels for our retail customers on many products, as demand for our products exceeded our own expectations in the face of this persistent pandemic. We have a high sense of urgency on this with all hands on deck. We're accessing third-party supply sources and focusing our manufacturing on those products that can be supplied more quickly. And we are ahead of plan on this. Since Q3, we were able to bring on more than 10 new suppliers to help us maximize our output, not just for disinfecting products but for other parts of our portfolio too. For disinfecting products, we're continuing to run our plants 24/7 and we'll be bringing more disinfecting capacity online in the mid-term. With all the levers we're pulling to expand output, I am confident in our ability to do better for our customers and consumers. Before I go on to my next message, I'd like to say again, how much I've valued the commitment of Clorox people and their contributions to our Q4 and fiscal year results. Our team of 8,800 strong continues to step up every day to contribute to our efforts of supporting our consumers, customers and communities. My second message is this. The fundamentals of our business are strong. Given the progress on our core business, which contributed to our overall fiscal year '20 results and gives us momentum for fiscal year '21. I feel good about the fundamentals of our business and the continued progress on our core. In fiscal year '20, incremental sales from innovation exceeded the company's historical average. As you've heard from Lisah, we introduced a number of exciting products in fiscal year '20 and continue to see growth from big innovation platforms. Our relentless focus on delivering superior consumer value through market leading innovation continues to differentiate our products and brands. And I'm proud that in fiscal year '20, the percentage of our US portfolio seen by consumers as delivering superior value has risen to an all-time high, positioning our brands well in this recession. In Q4, we also had more than 90% of our US portfolio at growing or stable household penetration, the strongest results we've achieved to date. I'm also pleased that total company market share in tracked channels grew. And our market shares in the fast e-commerce -- fast growing e-commerce channel continued to grow as well supported by increase in digital advertising. After fiscal year '20, our sales in the e-commerce channel now represents about 12% of total company sales, compared to 8% in fiscal year 2019, and well ahead of our plan. Results like these demonstrate we made the right choice to lean into advertising investments in fiscal year '20 including spending about $70 million more in the back half of the fiscal year, compared to the same period in fiscal year '19. Importantly our progress against business fundamentals is setting us up well for fiscal year '21, and I feel confident about our ability to continue driving long-term momentum. And this leads me to my last message. We remain committed to building on this momentum for our global portfolio through strong investments to further strengthen our competitive position, grow our categories and deliver long-term shareholder value guided by our IGNITE Strategy. Clearly these are extraordinary times. So it's hard to anticipate what will happen even in the near-term future. We continue to believe COVID-19 will have lasting impacts on global consumer behavior and trends including how consumers engage in our categories and with our brands, leading to meaningful long-term growth potential for our company. And as people continue to navigate what looks to be a significant recession, we anticipate that pressures related to unemployment and discretionary spending will spotlight the need to focus on value. We also anticipate they will keep turning to trusted brands to help them and their families stay safe as well as to support the Health and Wellness on day-to-day needs. As Kevin noted, our fiscal year '21 earnings outlook reflects the significant volatility and uncertainty, and also deliberate and aggressive investments behind our global portfolio and longer term growth initiatives. During these uncertain times, we plan to play offense to grow sales in fiscal year '21 off of an elevated fiscal year '20 base. And we plan to continue investing in long-term value creation with a focus on our ambition to accelerate sales growth beyond the fiscal year. Here is what you can expect in fiscal year '21. We will plan to increase advertising to about 11% of sales. We will invest in innovating experiences behind brand purpose, frictionless shopping and sticky product innovation, including our strong innovation pipeline in fiscal year '21. We will increase capital spending to expand production capacity so that together with our customers, we can better meet consumer demand, particularly for disinfecting products, but also, so that we can begin to fully take advantage of the opportunity to support public health out of home. As you've likely seen, we've started collaborating with leading brands like Uber Technologies, United Airlines and AMC Theaters to support their efforts to keep their customers safe. And we recently announced our partnership with Cleveland Clinic, which brings together our respective capabilities and expertise to support public health as we all continue to face COVID-19. As a people centered company, everything we do through our IGNITE Strategy continues to be in service of delivering superior value, because now and longer term we know it's the key to keep winning with consumers. And of course, we'll continue to focus on growing our business the right way, committed to our values with ESG integrated in our business, so that we are also creating value for all of our stakeholders. We're proud that last week's Axios Harris Poll 100, a survey of about 35,000 Americans ranked The Clorox Company number one for corporate reputation in the US based on seven dimensions : trust, vision, growth, products, culture, ethics and citizenship. Now and in the future Clorox will remain focused on Good Growth. Growth that's profitable, responsible and sustainable. And with that let me turn it over to Linda. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Benno. And hello to everyone on the call today. First, let me start off by saying just how excited I am to be Clorox' next CEO. After 17 years with the company, what makes me most proud about taking the reins from Benno is that Clorox is truly a special company. We have iconic brands people love and a wonderful values-led team that takes to heart our role in making people's lives better. Second, I'm optimistic about the company's future and look forward to working with the executive team to accelerate growth. This is a pivotal time for the company and there is no better time to be CEO at Clorox. What's become even clearer during this pandemic is that we're a Health and Wellness company at heart. Whether through our disinfecting products that support public health, our Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements that enhance wellness, or other essential products that people count on for their families and homes, I firmly believe that our global portfolio of trusted brands is in a strong position to address the shifting consumer mindsets and behaviors related to health and wellbeing. What's also clear is that we have a big opportunity to build on our momentum from fiscal year '20 for long-term value creation. And we're investing behind this momentum to support our ambition to accelerate profitable growth in fiscal year '21 and beyond. And finally before we begin Q&A, I want to take the opportunity to thank Benno for his just terrific leadership as CEO. Under Benno's guidance, Clorox more than doubled total shareholder return by putting innovation front and center, recognizing it's critical role in differentiating our products and brands to deliver superior consumer value. By investing in digital consumer engagement as a means to interact with people on their terms and through more personal experiences, and by taking ESG to the next level, challenging each of us to demonstrate its value to our business and society. Benno talked earlier about our commitment to Good Growth. Growth, that's profitable, responsible and sustainable. What he didn't say is that he was the one who introduced this. It captures most simply what we're all about. Profitable growth achieved the right way for our consumers, our shareholders and society. I've been very fortunate to work closely with Benno over the years. He has been a great mentor, and I look forward to continuing to partner with him to drive the business when I step into my role as CEO. Operator, you may now open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question does come from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JP Morgan. Andrea Teixeira : All right. Thank you. And Linda congratulations on your promotion and Benno, thank you for the great leadership all these years and significant time from your business agenda. So with all investment community over the years. So it's good to see at Clorox [ph], that you likely have more time to dedicate to strategic topics way forward. So I wanted to -- if you can talk about a bit with those agreements and you or Linda with the 10 new production partners on board and also the partnership with the Cleveland Clinic and the business partners like Uber, United and AMC Theaters. So I was hoping you've seen size this opportunity. I understand it's now about 7% of your sales, but I remember being like just about 6% in the prior fiscal year. So if you can give us kind of idea how you can continue to outpace this growth. And if we -- with this debottlenecking capacity? And how we could be thinking of the B2B against the B2C going forward, that will be great. Thank you again, and congrats to both. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Andrea. I'll get us started here. So as Benno mentioned earlier, we're very serious about the role that we play in public health. And as we look at our cleaning and disinfecting portfolio, we see opportunity broadly in the US and International across several spaces and I'll outline high level what those are. The first is continuing to delight people with products in the retail space. We know that we are not able to meet the demands and that is priority number one is getting much supply as we possibly can into the retail space to ensure that consumers have products they need during this time. The same is true in our traditional professional business, which you highlighted is about 7% of sales in fiscal year '20 and has been a high single-digit grower for us over a number of years. So working on supply in both of those. With the opportunity that you highlighted is one that we're aggressively pursuing and that is the merger of those two areas. As people re-enter public life, they are looking to be reassured that the spaces they enter are clean and disinfected. And what they would be reassured by as a trusted brands like the brand Clorox, is to ensure that that space is clean. They have that reassurance in their mind. And we're helping businesses do is welcome people back, whether that would be their employees or their guests and by using and partnering with Clorox's protocols and brands. They can offer their guests that reassurance that the space is safe. That's how we're thinking about that broader what we're calling out of home opportunity. We staffed a dedicated team to go after these partnerships and have resulted in things like you highlighted with United Airlines, Cleveland Clinic, AMC Theaters and Uber Technologies. What will be really important for us moving forward though is getting supply. So these are in initial stages of agreements, and what we're looking for is increase supply before we continue to expand the test markets that we have today, but we're seeing very good consumer and business response in the initial days. And if you think about our B2C and B2B in total, I think the thing for us to consider is those lines will continue to blur as we move forward, and that's what we are really well suited to do with all of our technologies and capabilities. Andrea Teixeira : No, that's great. And can you also like the capacity growth, I think you exit the last quarter with growing like 20%. I see debottleneck your capacity, how you're tracking now as you exit the quarter? Linda Rendle : Yes. Our plan is on pace to increase supply versus what we committed in Q4, but what Benno highlighted is the key, the demand that we're seeing is significantly higher than we had expected in Q4, and we expect that demand to remain elevated as we head into fiscal year '21. Our increase that we were able to deliver on supply did support strong double-digit growth in our Cleaning businesses. But to be clear, we're not satisfied with our service levels right now, and we have the absolute highest urgency to improve. Some of the things we're pleased to see though and will give us confidence as we move into the fiscal year '21 is that our state -- our supply chain remains very stable. So we have had very few COVID related disruptions. We were able to bring on more than 10 new suppliers. The majority of those in disinfecting to help us to support the increase in demand. We had anticipated that some businesses would begin to recover quicker, and we have seen that in the case of bleach where in stock levels at retail are looking much stronger than they had been, despite the fact that we've been prioritizing Healthcare. And the key message for takeaway is we are aggressively investing to expand capacity. We are working across the entire supply chain all the way back into raw materials, up through manufacturing, packaging and conversion. And we expect sequential improvement in fiscal year '21 in meeting that increase in demand. Andrea Teixeira : That's great. Thank you again, and best of luck. I'll pass it on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson of Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi. Congratulations to both of you, and Benno we will miss you. My question had to do with advertising. I'm a little bit surprised that you're increasing or you're targeting right now sort of 100 basis point increase for fiscal '21, number one, because I assume as your revenues to those partners grow that's actually revenue that you don't need to spend advertising behind. And I know that's kind of a rounding your probably in the great scheme of things. But still that's a big increase. It would be the highest level of ad spending that we've seen in a long time for you. And it's coming at a time where you are having a hard time meeting demand. So I would buy Clorox Life, whether I saw an ad or not. So can you talk a little bit more about the decision to increase ad spending by that magnitude, maybe which businesses you're targeting it to, and whether this is a new level going forward that we should expect or is there something specific in 2021 that that's driving that increase? Thanks. Benno Dorer : Yes. Thank you, Wendy. What you should takeaway is that this is an aggressive investment that is into the momentum that we have in the business. It also signals confidence in our strategy. And of course, as always with our company that's done with an eye on the long- term. For us advertising sales promotion is not a quarterly expense, it's a long-term investment in the health of our brands. And while 10% continues to be the level long-term that we're comfortable with, we see a particular opportunity at this time to invest in this pivotal opportunity that we have for our company to accelerate growth. It will go into demand building across all businesses both in the core as well as in innovation. I mentioned earlier, we have a very strong innovation program, in spite of the supply challenges right now, that we have great confidence and we have so much opportunity ahead. So we feel like this is the right thing to. It is an investment in the long-term health of the business. And, if you look at the fundamental business drivers of our business; as I mentioned them in Q4 with rising market shares, with household penetration growing or stable in north of 90% of our US portfolio. With market shares growing in International, with further opportunity to build out our International business to serve more consumers in the face of the pandemic. With consumer value perception being at its all-time high with well north of 50% of our portfolio being seen as superior. All those things are particularly strong indicators of future business momentum. So, against all of that and in particular also with the looming recession, which we think is going to be significant and is perhaps underestimated or somewhat overlooked at this time, in particular here in the US, we think this is simply the right thing to do, and it's certainly part of our recession playbook that we've successfully apply once before about 11 years ago. So, we have great confidence in this choice as part of a long-term growth strategy for our company. Wendy Nicholson : And specifically, just first half versus second half. so to those comments, specifically, if the economic environment really deteriorates is there a scenario where you would say, wow, these marketing dollars would be better spent in price rollbacks or promotional spending. How much of the ad spending itself are you expecting first half versus second half or kind of no difference? Benno Dorer : Typically we don't provide quarterly outlook. But it can certainly vary by quarter depending on, for instance, the timing of innovation launches. So you should expect that variation. Based on what we know today, even though you can never say never, right, in this business. But I cannot see us touch advertising sales promotion because like I said, it's not a tactical expense. It's an investment in long-term growth. So we will remain committed to spending the dollars. And frankly, if the recession gets worse, that's even more of a reason for us to spend in advertising sales promotion, in particular at this time, when people are looking at trusted brands to meet their needs. And as you know, we have many of those trusted brands that people rely on in particular doing a recession. Wendy Nicholson : Got it. Thank you so much. And again, best of luck. Operator : Our next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Benno kudos to you for a remarkable career, and Linda congrats on your appointment. The question I had was on capacity. And I guess Clorox, like most CPG companies is in a really tough spot in terms of how do you make a decision on long-term capacity decisions, when the category growth profile two years out is very uncertain. So I guess, I'm just asking, like how you guys at Clorox with all of your analytics are thinking about longer term category growth and how that's feeding into your decisions on capacity? I'm not just talking about disinfecting, because obviously that's going to remain elevated for a long time, but I'm also talking about charcoal and Hidden Valley Ranch and it's clearly at home food consumption is also elevated at the moment and may continue in the future? Thanks. Linda Rendle : Hi, Nik. Thanks for the question. So you're right, we're at a time where it is not a precise science right now to predict what the future is going to whole given what we're facing, but we are putting our analytics hard at work to understand what we think that future will look like. And if you take cleaning and disinfecting for example, we do strongly believe the category will remain elevated for the mid to long-term future and we're building capacity to address that. But how we're taking the approach on this one is to make sure that we build the right mid to long-term that allows us to have flexibility, and whether we in-house or we use co-packers for that production. So right now, as we've said we've added 10 new suppliers to help us with this incremental production and over time, if it's appropriate, we can insource that production, which helps us balance quality and cost, and also gets us to the right ratio from an efficiency perspective. So I feel really confident about our ability to do that and we're making choices that allow us to pivot depending on where this all shakes out. Nik Modi : And Linda, if I could just follow-up on that. How long do you think it will take for Clorox to catch up with your expected level of demand over the next -- over fiscal '21. I mean is it going to take three quarters to get to where you want to be, or is it two quarters or any perspective around that? Linda Rendle : Yes. For a good portion of our businesses, Kingsford, Brita, Glad, Nutranext, for example, we feel like will be normalized by the end of the calendar, where we have a really good supply and demand match. From cleaning and disinfecting perspective, we do expect this to continue to be a ramp-up over the entire fiscal year. And we'll see sequential improvement throughout the fiscal year, but given the fact that cold and flu sits in the middle of the year, and then we expect the pandemic to be with us for the entirety of the year. It will take the full year to get up to the supply levels that we need to be at. Nik Modi : Great. That was very helpful. And good luck to the both of you. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Nik. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Thanks. And Benno and Linda, I want to extend my congratulations to the both of you as well. My question is -- pulls together a couple of elements from Wendy and Nik's question. But tying it into the longer term outlook for the company. So beyond fiscal '21 and really looking beyond, so the current outlook is for 2% to 4% of core sales growth, but as you look at that target the low to mid-point certainly seems to be inadequate given a lot of the dynamics that we've spoken about, increased structural demand in some of these categories, particularly around Cleanliness and Health and Wellness. You're clearly investing a lot of capacity as Wendy rightly pointed out, the advertising and marketing we're tracking this correctly. We haven't seen any sort of levels as a percent of sales since fiscal 2003 for the company. So there is an awful lot of investment, both OpEx and CapEx going into the business. So it does certainly seems and certainly what's reflecting the stock right now is nothing in the 2% to 3% kind of range. So with all of that being said, when will the company be prepared to provide an update to investors or to the extent you can comment today, what are you thinking as part of your planning around capacity, around other investments in the P&L. So any commentary there would be helpful? Thank you. Kevin Jacobsen : Hey Kevin, it's Kevin. And I can take that question. And you're right. Look, we have a -- an outlook right now as part of our IGNITE which is 2% to 4% growth. But what I think you're hearing from myself, Linda and Benno today, it is clear, our aspiration is to accelerate the profitable growth of this company. And we are leaning in. We have millions of new consumers coming into our categories. We have new growth opportunities, particularly out of home and we are leaning into these opportunities with the intent to accelerate the performance of the company. It is too early for us to raise our long-term goals. Remember, these goals go out over five years. So it's -- I would say it's in the early innings of the work we're doing. But that certainly is our intention. And at some point, we'll come back to the investor community and update you on our expectations, but I'd say a little too early for that right now. But trust, what you're hearing from us is our intent to accelerate performance and we're leaning in to do that. Kevin Grundy : Okay, fair enough. Thanks, Kevin. I'll pass it on. Benno Dorer : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Our next question comes from Olivia Tong of Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Thank you. Good afternoon and congrats Linda and Benno. It's been a pleasure. All the best to you guys. And Benno in your next endeavors with you. Wanted to talk a little bit about the performance of your categories in recession, because obviously you're leaning into quite a bit of spending. And if you could provide a bit more specificity on your expectations by segment. Because, you're looking for -- obviously a pretty rapid deceleration against the COVID backdrop. And you talked about new customers without losing the old, the potential to further expand your professional partnerships which seems obviously pretty meaningful in this environment. And you seem more amenable to potential international expansion to with the Saudi JV and obviously there's innovation. So on top of that still catching up to demand, so if you could just talk through how drastic maybe the last recession was in some of your categories or what you had to do in terms of promotional advertising to help us understand the outlook a little bit better. That would be super helpful. Thank you. Benno Dorer : I'll start and then Kevin can build on that. So typically what we see in a recession, if you take the last recession. You see about a 0.2 growth in our categories lower than what you'd see in an average year. And then if you double click, there is a number of categories in a normal recession and again right now you have the pandemic, of course, as an additional impact. But you have a number of categories that actually see stronger sales doing a recession. And intuitively that makes sense to see businesses like Kingsford, as people grill more at-home, Brita as people use less bottled water and move to filtered water for it's much superior value, Hidden Valley for more at-home eating occasions, those categories have historically performed very well. And we'd expect to continue that. So there will be puts and takes, and again the difficulty of course, for this outlook is in the volatility created by recession, but also the pandemic as an outlook. And of course, fiscal year '21 back half that will lapse some pretty formidable numbers. But what's been part of the recipe last time in 2008 - '09 was to really focus on investing into the consumer, play offense as we call it, which is our intention now. The playbook includes innovation and we have a strong innovation portfolio in fiscal year '21. And the playbook includes to emphasize consumer value and of course, we're going into this recession with a lot of momentum being seen as superior value on so many of our brands at this point. So we have a strong recession playbook. Our portfolio typically has been recession-resilient, and importantly, we have a very experienced team where nine out of 10 BU General Managers have been with the business at the time of the last recession and a very experienced Senior Management team knowing how to handle this. So we feel like we have an established playbook, and we will certainly continue to invest in the long-term health of the business and the elevated advertising sales promotion spend is certainly part of that. Kevin, any additional thoughts from you. Kevin Jacobsen : Hey, Olivia. Maybe just a couple other thoughts as it relates to the recession and how we managed through the last recession about 11 years ago. So as Benno said, our belief is, and what we've seen as our categories tend to be fairly resilient. If you look at our business performance in the last recession, I believe 8 of our 10 business units grew sales over that period. So not only have the categories been resilient, but our brands have also been resilient during that period of time. And what I'd also have you note is, you always have to think about what drove the recession back in '08-'09, that was a financial crisis. This is a healthcare crisis. So it's very different. We have much more engaged consumers in our categories than we did back in '08 and '09. In addition to that, if you look at our CVM, we're at an all-time high with about 59% of our portfolio identified as superior relative to competition. And we've got the highest household penetration either stable or growing that we had in the history of the company. So you never look forward to recession, but I can tell you having been through three at Clorox, this is the strongest our portfolio has been going into a recession. And then, the only other item I'd offer is what may be different about this recession is, the government as obviously stepped in and this is the most support we've ever seen for consumers during this recession right now in terms of unemployment benefits. We'll have to see how that plays out. But if you assume that government is going to continue to actively support consumers through this process that will certainly help us as well. And so we'll see how that plays out. But I feel pretty good about the overall health of our portfolio heading into this recession. Olivia Tong : Thanks. That's helpful. And then Linda, you're obviously taking over arguably with a lot of growth priorities today versus history. So I'm wondering if you could talk more about how you're prioritizing them relative to one another? I'm sure, obviously the first order business is increasing the capacity for Cleaning and Disinfecting, but there is e-commerce stepping up support for professional, obviously driving the rest of the business as well. So how are you thinking about allocating those investment dollars that you're planning for next year? And then with that JV acquisition, does that in any way signal how open you are to M&A in support of some of the initiatives? Thanks. Linda Rendle : Thanks. Yes, you hit it on the head. The absolute number one priority is executing with excellence this year and increasing supply to meet the demand. We will be focused on delivering the plan that we put in place, which we have passion and conviction around. The business fundamentals are strong across categories. But we must do better on supply to meet demand. Second, IGNITE for us is the right strategy. I was the Lead Architect of that, got to lead our team in creating that and what it has done for us over these last many months as helped us lead through really troubling and volatile times. And what that strategy commits us to us putting people at the center of everything we do, knowing consumers and the people we serve in communities better than anyone, innovating great experiences for them with our products, and that's what we're going to continue to lean into. And we have a team of 8,800 people and an executive team that's passionate and own that strategy, and want to accelerate it. And that gets me to my third point. Where we place investment is in those IGNITE areas that we have passion and conviction around. We're going to lean into our global portfolio, and given the strength of it across the board, we will do what we always do is, we'll follow the money and where we think the best long-term value creation opportunities exist. Cleaning is certainly one of those areas and we've talked a lot about the opportunities we have there around the globe. And then last, what I'll leave you with is, we're committed to how we work. This pandemic has allowed us to re-imagine work quicker than we had ever imagined. Moving our people to work from home, keeping our essential workers healthy and our manufacturing running at full speed. But now what we imagine work will turn to is playing offense 100% of the time. That will be our focus. We use technology to do that to make quick decisions and pivot to put investment where we'll get the highest long-term return, but we feel really confident about those choices and we've managed a number of categories and brands for years and we always feel like we are able to put the investment where it's best suited and we'll do that again this year. And then NASA is a continued focus actually on the core, excuse me, Saudi Arabia is a continued focus on the core. We've been in that business for 50 years, and a joint venture with a family-owned business. It is core to our Cleaning business where we serve many countries in the Gulf region. And we have tremendous confidence in the ability for that business to continue strong growth in the future. It's core to Health and Wellness. We know that consumer has high demand for those products today. We saw double-digit growth in our Saudi Arabia business in fiscal year '20, and it's margin accretive to the company. So to us this isn't a right churn, but this is just a focus on what we talked about in International, which is accelerating profitable growth and leaning into areas that are stable and that we can ensure have long-term growth run rate for us. Olivia Tong : Thanks very much. All the best. Operator : Our next question is from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney : Thanks very much for the question. And let me add my congratulations to both Benno and Linda. Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on -- last quarter you gave us some very, very helpful breakdowns of household penetration versus retail. I guess two questions in there. First, can you tell us -- can you give us any more update about how much of your growth this quarter in Cleaning particularly has been household -- new households, new claim behaviors? And now to worry about -- I don't know, a few months into this and you have some new users. Any additional [indiscernible] give us about repeat -- particularly among new users, new cleaning behavior, people buy more wipes. Are those people coming back to the store for a second, third and at what rate? Thank you. Benno Dorer : Yes. Thanks, Jonathan. Double-digit growth in Q4 in all four segments, and certainly seeing elevated consumer demand across the majority of our categories. Consumer fundamentals as we've noted and as you picked up on are very strong and certainly fueled by the incremental $70 million that we put in in advertising sales promotion in the back half of last fiscal year. But I would say in the vast majority of categories, if you double-click on the consumer behavior, leading to such strong growth, it's very, very strong. What we're seeing is more usage occasions in many categories caused by the pandemic, of course, but also by people staying at home. And we're seeing household penetration increases in most of our categories, and that's really been the major growth driver here. And then we're also seeing, which is very encouraging a higher purchase frequency in several categories indicating that it's more people using our product more than they ever have. We see very, very little stock-up, the exception maybe is, Burt's Bees, where store closings and lower food traffic and beauty care, but also less usage in some categories like facial towel lets and color cosmetics, which makes sense as people stay home has led to a pressure on sales and litter, where we're seeing a category-wide trough from initial pantry loading, but more broadly this is all fundamentally healthy growth with higher household penetration and higher purchase frequencies. I want to maybe point out Kingsford, as an example, beyond cleaning and disinfecting where it's quite obvious, I think that we are seeing particularly strong household penetration increases, but also strong increases in usage frequency. Kingsford for the first time in a while is going household penetration again and all the fundamental underlying indicators in the category is very healthy. We are seeing people buy more Grills, and of course, that Grill purchase increase leads to more consumption of consumables like charcoal. We are seeing millenials come into the category. A big reason why we've been able to grow household penetration is that millennials now come back into the category, so we're seeing incredibly strong growth even with a complete assets. John I don't know if that's you with we need a phone on mute. Thank you. But we're seeing new people come in, we're seeing millennials enter the category and we're seeing them use the product often. So lot of positive underlying metrics behind our Q4 sales growth and we expect this to continue for sure mid-term. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks. Good morning and congratulations to both of you also. I wanted to talk a little bit about International. I know that the Saudi Arabia joint venture is something that Clorox has been very proud of for many years. But you mentioned -- Linda, I think you mentioned the word global. There has been international few times and the company I think has for the last several years has been more about the go lean, get tight control cost and really focused on right models from where you were playing. But to what degree does -- I guess, the current landscape, both in terms of consumer need and in terms of the strength of the Clorox brand and the sort of flexibility you presumably have on profitability, does that enhance your international growth aspirations? Maybe Linda if you were looking at IGNITE and setting the strategy today versus 12 months ago, do you think International would play a bigger role and if not, why not? Thanks. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Lauren. So we absolutely have the opportunity to meet more consumer demand in the US and International. And we're moving quickly with supply chain investments to support expansion in both. What I want you to take away is, we don't see a fundamental change in the composition between the percent of our business in the US and International. We see the ability to grow both strongly. But if you think about the International opportunity specifically, there are three things that we're focused on. The first is, we just need to increase supply to meet the demand that we have in the markets we're already in and the products that we already have in those locations. And we're focused on that just like we are in the US. The second is, we absolutely have an opportunity to expand our product forms in countries we compete in today. So for example, there are many places around the world where wipes have low penetration or we don't play and we see that as being an offering that consumers might be ready for in different areas of the world. And then the third, we are evaluating expansion into new geographies and we certainly see very high interest from consumers in different parts of the world for the Clorox brand in particular. And whether it's interest, we will look and see if there is long-term disciplined approach we can take to entering that market where we see strong return on investments. So that will be very consistent with how we've approached International to date. And that's what I would leave you with is, definite opportunity in International. No change in terms of how we think about the role it will play in our overall portfolio. And we'll be aggressive in pursuing opportunities when we have confidence in them. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks. And then, if I may just also a question on competition. So I think you went -- you've all went through very clearly reasons why market share performance at least in tracked channels is what it is, and it may be not the best gauge of kind of what's materially going on in your business, both curious still how you were thinking about an increase in competitive dynamics, more players, more brands with really reasonable and strong brand equities, looking to play in some of your phases. Historically, actually part of the hallmark of Clorox has been that sort of big share brands and in kind of midsized categories. Your categories aren't going to midsized anymore possibly with where we're talking today. So what do you do in the dynamics those categories change, the competitive landscape changes. What -- how are you thinking about that? Benno Dorer : Thank you, Lauren. I mean look our competitors -- our categories, have always been very competitive. They are competitive and they will be competitive. There is no question. And we also can assume I think that reasonably assume that in the disinfecting space in particular, it's an attractive space. Looking at the growth and the profitability and the ability to make a difference to so many consumers around the world we can expect that that will be more competitive. But for us that's our daily bread and has been our daily bread for very long time. And how do we go about that? We build leading brands. And as we've commented a few times those brands generally are in a great shape. We invest behind them. We invest with an eye on the long-term. We keep the value sharp and we've also commented how that's in the best shape it's ever been, and we innovate, innovate, innovate. So we're not waiting for competition to come in and we are certainly used to competition to try and come in and disinfecting and without sounding arrogant, a lot of times the competition came and went, and we will defend our home turf and importantly as Linda said earlier, we will play offense a 100% of the time. So, we can assume that this business is going to continue to be very competitive. But we're ready for it and we certainly as you noted, are taking the stance and have the financial flexibility to invest in our business in order to ensure success with an aspiration of accelerating long-term growth for the company. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Thanks so much and congratulations, again. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Thank you. And sincere congratulations from me as well Benno. And Linda obviously big congratulations you're way too. I guess, I was hoping you could talk more about the biggest drivers underlying what I see is a fairly wide bottom line range for fiscal '21 relative to an arguably more narrow top line range and I guess I'm specifically interested in how you're thinking about gross margins. I missed the demand volatility and supply constraints, recessionary pressures that you've alluded to as well as some of the competitive dynamics that Lauren just called out. So is there a way to talk about gross margin as a driver of '21 guidance? Kevin Jacobsen : Steve, this is Kevin. And I can talk about both our EPS range and gross margin. I'd say, to your point, our EPS range we're providing this year is wider than what we typically provide on a normal year end. And I'd say that that wider range is really driven by two areas that we expect to see increased variability in our results. The first is the top line, and I think that's probably pretty obvious. The ongoing impact of COVID-19. The impact of the recession, how that will play out on our portfolio will clearly be difficult to predict over the course of the full year. I think we've got decent visibility as we look out over the very near term. But as we get into the back half of the year and we're lapping the 20% organic growth from last year, more difficult for us to determine exactly where that will play out. And so there will be some level of variability from the top line. I would say in addition to the top line variability, when you look at our supply chain, where I expect to see increased variability from previous years is specifically in manufacturing and logistics in terms of the impact we're seeing from COVID-19 and maybe to dimensionalize that, in our fourth quarter, we had about a $30 million of up charges we incurred in our supply chain related to COVID-19. And now as I look forward into '21, we expect those to be temporary charges and we expect them to diminish over time. But a lot of that will be driven by how the pandemic plays out, which is clearly outside of our control. And so it's difficult to call exactly where our gross margin land. And if you think about it $10 million change in profitability is worth about 1 point of EPS growth for this company. And so it's not inconceivable that we could see $20 million or $30 million variability and the supply chain as it relates to the impact of COVID over the course of the year, that would generate 2 point to 3 point change in our EPS performance for the year. And so I think when you look at the variability in the top line, you look at the variability on the COVID cause hitting our supply chain, that's the reason why we have a wider EPS range to start the year. Now as it relates to gross margin, I actually think gross margin be very much in line with where we land on EPS. If we end up with negative EPS for the years because we had larger COVID cost and supply chain than we anticipated and likely declining gross margin. And conversely, if we generate EPS growth this year it will be driven by COVID cost doing better than we anticipated in growing margins for the year. And so that's how we're seeing right now. It's obviously very early in the year, as we get smarter, we'll certainly update you as we learn more in terms of how we think it's going to land, but I think to start the year this feels like a prudent place to start with the range we said. Steve Powers : Yes, that's fair. Thank you for that. I guess, kind of, while you're talking, is there a way you can put some numbers around your expectations for cash generation next year and also the uses of that cash, I'm particularly interested in CapEx, just given the manufacturing ramp that you've called out? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. So as it relates to cash and maybe specifically CapEx, with significant access of cash we're generating as a company. I think you saw in my prepared remarks, it's up about 56% for the full fiscal year, although I'd tell you in the back half year we had doubled the rate of cash we are generating over the last six months of fiscal year '20. So the company is in very good financial position in terms of access to cash to allow us to invest in the business. And again what you're hearing from the three of us today is, we are doing just that, we're taking that cash and we're putting into the business with our intent to accelerate our performance over the long-term. As it relates specific to CapEx, we are also investing in capacity expansion is the primary focus for us. Typically, as a company, our capital spending is somewhere between 3% and 4% of sales revenue each year. I'd say if you look back over the last few years, we've been closer to the low end of that range, a little over 3%. We started investing in the fourth quarter. We invested about $100 million of additional capital in the fourth quarter and that put us just below 4% last year as a percent of sales. As I look forward to '21, as we continue to invest in capacity expansion particularly in disinfecting, Steve, I think we'll end up somewhere between 4% and 4.5% as a percent of sales into capital spending and that puts us if you do the math, that gets us to about $300 million in CapEx spending for the year. And I think that's probably a pretty good assumption for now to work with. Steve Powers : Makes sense. Congratulations again. Lisah -- I mean sorry Linda and Benno. Thank you. Benno Dorer : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Our next question is from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey. Good afternoon, folks. And I'll fill that last sentiment, congratulations Linda and Benno I wish you well and I'm going to miss your quarterly banter. So on to my questions. The guidance for a sequential deceleration, albeit it's still strong levels. It is a little bit surprising context of what any of you guys say that your demand is massively outstripping your supply and your shipping pretty much -- you're selling everything you can and selling everything you could in the fourth quarter translated into 23% organic sales growth and nearly $2 billion of revenue. Why couldn't you match that in the first quarter, if demand is so robust and so meaningfully outstripping supply? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. Jason, this is Kevin. I think your question is specifically really to Q1 and while we don't typically provide quarterly guidance, we thought it was helpful to provide some perspective front half, back half and what we said is, we do expect double-digit top line growth in Q1, to your point. We continue to see very strong demand for our products. It is outstripping our ability to supply. In the near term, we expect that to continue and because of that, we do expect a very strong first quarter. Jason English : Okay. I'll try offline on that one later. On components of your growth, price was obviously a meaningful contributor to this quarter and I imagine promotions. I suspect a lot of that's trade spent with the promotional programs pulled out of the market, given supply-demand imbalance. What is the cadence of that look like based on your expectations as we progress through the year. Should we expect similar price contribution in the first quarter and waning over the quarter? Or could it moderate even faster? Benno Dorer : Yes. Jason there is -- there are clearly as you noted, there hasn't been a lot of price promotion in our categories for sure. It's part of what's encouraging for instance on Kingsford that we were able to grow double-digits without what is usually a pretty healthy price promotion during peak events or holidays like 4th of July and Memorial Day. So that's all encouraging. But if you think about our trade spends, our trade spend, the vast majority of our trade spend is performance-driven, meaning it's tied to customer performance and the customer performance is there. So there are -- there aren't a lot of savings in trade spend, because we're honoring the commitments and because for many of our customers the trade spend is rolled into everyday low pricing. And that's going to continue. So as you think about trade spend, there is not going to be a windfall over the next fiscal year. It's been a little lower in Q4 as you will have noted. And that could continue. But it's also going to vary by quarter and trade spend is not going to be a big source of savings going forward. Jason English : Okay. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Operator : And our final question comes from Linda Bolton-Weiser of D.A. Davidson. Linda Bolton-Weiser: Hi, thanks for taking my question. You made some comments about the general charcoal category and the growth there and what's driving it, but I was wondering if you could be more specific about your own share recovery that at least in the tracked channels it does look like your share is improving. And was the hickory pellet launch important in share growth or is that just too small at this point? And when can we expect the next innovation in charcoal? Thanks. Benno Dorer : Yes. Thanks, Linda and welcome back. That's a nice way to end it. I would characterize Kingsford as a good story in that we had implemented much improved plans, which led to a really strong retailer support and that came just in time as consumers were looking to Grill more in the face of pandemic. So a really nice turnaround story with the second quarter -- consecutive quarter of growth, after certainly a weaker period and Q4 up double digits. Share was up strongly. It's one of our strongest growing businesses share-wise. And if you look at the underlying factors, it is strong retailer support as mentioned, it's household penetration returning to growth. On the brand, it's a growing category, even without the aggressive peak holiday discounts, heavy Grill sales, all of it really encouraging. So the vast majority of the sales and share growth is just on the core. And the good news is, there is so much opportunity left, given the performance in previous years, we are really just scratching the surface of what we can do to recover lost share growth, but also benefit from a category that clearly is on trend. Pellets itself is off to a strong start, and also continues to build and will also keep building in the fiscal year '21 season. But really it has not been a strong factor in the grand scheme of things as we think about the sales growth. So really solid momentum on Kingsford as we enter fiscal year '21 with so much opportunity ahead. Linda Bolton-Weiser: Thank you and good luck. Kevin Jacobsen : Thanks, Linda. Benno Dorer : Thanks, Linda and thanks to everybody. Thank you everyone again for joining us today. I hope that all of you and your families will stay healthy, and I also hope that our paths will cross again at some point after we get through this pandemic. And in the meantime, please stay well and Linda, Kevin and Lisah will speak to you about Clorox's Q1 fiscal year '21 results on November 20 -- no, on November 2. Thank you, all. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Clorox Company First Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. Lisah Burhan : Thank you, Sharon. Welcome, everyone and thank you for joining us. We certainly hope you and your family continue to remain safe and healthy in what remains a challenging environment. As usual, we have a few reminders before we go into results. We are broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for 7 days at our website, at cloroxcompany.com. Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected or potential impact of COVID-19. These statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations, but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements and the non-GAAP financial information section, which includes the table that reconciles non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, both of which are located at the end of today\u2019s earnings release, which has also been posted on our website and filed with the SEC. Turning to today\u2019s discussion of our results, I will start by covering our usual top line commentary with highlights in each of our segments. Kevin will then address our total company results, as well as our FY \u201821 outlook. Finally, Linda will offer her perspective and we\u2019ll close with Q&A. For the total company, Q1 sales increased 27%, reflecting about a point of benefit from the acquisition of majority interest in our joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and about a point of headwinds from unfavorable foreign exchange impact. This quarter\u2019s 27% organic sales growth is supported by double digit sales growth in eight of our 10 businesses. I will now go through our results by segment. In our Health and Wellness segment, Q1 sales were up 28%, reflecting double digit growth in all three businesses. Our Cleaning business had another quarter of double digit growth behind continued strong demand, for our disinfecting products. While we continue to make progress expanding supply, we\u2019re still not at a point where we can fully meet ongoing elevated demand. Despite those constraints, our Clorox brand continues to see increases in both household penetration and repeat rates. We\u2019ve been investing behind this momentum to convert new users to loyal consumers, and we\u2019ve been seeing very strong return on our investment. On the innovation front, our bleach complexion effort is now complete. The Clorox fabric sanitizer platform and Clorox disinfecting wet mopping cloth both continue to show strong growth. On a related note, our wet mopping cloth, along with our Clorox and Clorox Scentiva branded disinfecting wipes and Pine-Sol multi-surface cleaner, all recently received approval from the EPA, for kill claims against the virus that causes COVID-19 on hard non-porous surfaces. Our professional products business also had double-digit sales growth behind strong shipments across all of our disinfecting product lines. A key driver of growth this quarter was the total Clorox Total 360 system, which uses an electrostatic technology to deliver disinfectants to large, hard to reach areas. To support sales and continued momentum in this business, we\u2019re bringing online, new production capacity this month, for the disinfectant used in these devices. In addition, we\u2019ve created a dedicated out of home team, that focuses on growth opportunities in new channels and spaces, to further build on strategic alliances with already established, with Uber Technologies, United Airlines, AMC Theaters and Cleveland Clinic. Lastly, within this segment, our Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements business grew sales by double digits this quarter. This strong growth was driven by shipments to replenish retail inventories, following the recent supply disruptions, and by shipments in support of our RenewLife brand re-launch. Our priorities this year are to continue to improve service levels, in order to capture the strong consumption trend, execute the RenewLife brand re-launch with excellence, and deliver consumer meaningful innovation. Turning to the Household segment, Q1 sales were up 39% with growth in all three businesses. Grilling sales more than doubled this quarter, due mainly to strong consumption behind the grilling occasions and increased household penetration. Sales growth this quarter was also driven partly by customer replenishment of inventory. We\u2019ve been very pleased to see the strong turnaround of this business, reflected in our continued share growth, strong collaboration with the retailers, and successful entry into the pellet category, with our Kingsford pellets continuing to build distribution and share. With recent increases in grilling occasions and new households, including millennials, we\u2019re optimistic about the prospects of this business, and will invest behind this momentum to drive long-term profitable category growth. Glad sales were up by double-digits in Q1, behind ongoing strong demand for our products, as consumers continue to spend more time at home. We\u2019re building on this momentum with a consistent stream of innovation, including our new Glad ForceFlex with Clorox trash bags, which launched in September. This product eliminates Food and bacterial odors throughout the trash bags, and has already earned more than 1,000 five star ratings online from consumers. Our Glad ForceFlex trash bags with unique fragrances and colors, which launched in Q3, also continue to perform well, and are among top selling new items at major retailers. Cat Litter sales grew in Q1, driven mainly by strong online shipments in innovation, supported by higher advertising investments. We\u2019re encouraged by our return to share growth in Fresh Step, behind the continued strong performance of Fresh Step Clean Paws innovation platform and the strong start of Fresh Step with Gain Original Scented Litter with the power of Febreze. In our Lifestyle segment, Q1 sales increased 17% with double-digit growth in two of three businesses. Brita sales were up by double-digits for the third consecutive quarter. The growth is driven by \u2013 mainly by continued strong consumption, especially in larger sized systems and long last systems and filters. Sales growth was also driven partly by customer replenishment of inventory, an effort our team has been very focused on. Household penetration for Brita continues to grow, which gives us more reason to invest further. We\u2019ll be introducing a new and improved LongLast Plus filter that allows water to flow faster and captures more contaminants, along with a new pitcher. The Food business also saw double-digit sales growth, behind ongoing strong consumption of our Hidden Valley Ranch products, which continues to benefit from more at-home eating occasions. This is another business where we\u2019re seeing household penetration growth. We will continue to invest in innovation, and are encouraged to see a strong start to our new Hidden Valley Ranch secret sauce dressing. Finally Burt\u2019s Bees sales decreased this quarter. As the business continued to be impacted by lower store traffic, especially in parts of the store, where Burt\u2019s Bees products are typically found. We have since accelerated our online strategy and strengthened our presence in the fast growing cough and cold category, with the launch of a new line of Rescue Balm with turmeric. While we expect the category-wide challenges to persist in the short term, we have strong confidence in the Burt\u2019s Bees brand and its long-term growth prospects, supported by a robust innovation platform. Now turning to International, Q1 sales grew 18%, driven by ongoing elevated demand for our products, disinfecting products, and essential household products, across nearly every geography. Organic sales grew 17%, reflecting about 9 points of benefit from the Saudi JV acquisition and about 8 points of unfavorable foreign currency headwinds. Our international business has very strong momentum and we are looking to build on that through investments that accelerate our IGNITE Strategy. Increasing the stake in our Saudi JV is just an example of that. Another example is the international expansion of our Clorox disinfecting wipes, which are now being supported by a dedicated supply chain, separate from that in the U.S. This will allow us to better meet ongoing elevated demand in our existing international markets where we currently offer wipes, and to launch this consumer preferred form into new geographies. Now, I will turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss Q1 performance, as well as our updated outlook for FY \u201821. Kevin Jacobsen : Thank you, Lisa and thank you everyone for joining us today. I sincerely hope you and your families are well. I am pleased with our very strong start to the fiscal year, reflecting broad-based strength across our portfolio, with double-digit volume, sales and profit growth in each of our reporting segments. Additionally, each reporting segment delivered gross margin expansion, contributing to our eighth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion for the company. As you saw in our press release, we raised our fiscal year \u201821 outlook, given the strength of our Q1 results and our expectations for a higher top line growth over the balance of the fiscal year. Turning to our first quarter results, first quarter sales were up 27%, driven by 22 points of organic volume growth and 5 points of favorable price mix. Sales results also included one point of growth from acquiring majority control of our Saudi joint venture, offset by one point of FX headwinds. On an organic basis, sales grew 27%. Gross margin for the quarter increased 400 basis points to 48% compared to 44% in the year ago quarter. First quarter gross margin included the benefit of strong volume growth, as well as 170 basis points of cost savings and 150 basis points of favorable mix. These factors were partially offset by 300 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, which were similar to last quarter, included temporary COVID-19 spending. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 12% compared to 14% in the year ago quarter. Primarily from increased operating leverage. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales, came in at about 9%, equal to the year ago quarter. We\u2019re spending for our U.S. retail business coming in at 11% of sales. Importantly, this represented about a 30% increase in advertising support this quarter, compared to the year ago period, reflecting stronger investments to support our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth. Our first quarter effective tax rate was 21%, compared to 22% in the year ago quarter, primarily driven by the impact of our increased ownership of our Saudi joint venture. Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share of $3.22 versus $1.59 in the year ago quarter, an increase of 103%. Excluding the contribution from our Saudi joint venture acquisition, Q1 diluted EPS grew 66%. As you also saw in our press release, Q1 net cash provided by operations was $383 million versus $271 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 41%. Our strong cash flow was due to profitable sales growth, partially offset by higher employee incentive compensation payments made in the first quarter, which were related to our fiscal year \u201820 performance. Turning to our fiscal year outlook, we now anticipate fiscal year sales to grow between 5% to 9%, reflecting our strong Q1 results as well as our raised expectations for the balance of the fiscal year, including double-digit growth in Q2. And as we noted last quarter, we continue to anticipate deceleration in the back half of fiscal year \u201821, as we lap double-digit growth in the same period in fiscal year \u201820, when we saw the initial spike in COVID-19. Importantly we continue to assume or back half sales results will be significantly stronger relative to pre-pandemic sales levels. We also continue to anticipate about 1 point of contribution from our Saudi joint venture, offset by one point of foreign exchange headwinds. On an organic sales basis, our outlook assumes 5% to 9% growth. We expect fiscal year gross margin to be about flat, reflecting the benefit of strong cost savings and higher sales, offset by rising commodity and transportation costs, as well as temporary costs related to COVID-19. For perspective, we expect gross margin expansion in the front half, followed by a contraction over the balance of the fiscal year, as we lap gross margin expansion of 250 basis points delivered in the back half of fiscal year \u201820, driven by strong operating leverage from robust shipment growth during the initial phase of the pandemic. We continue to expect fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to be about 14% of sales, as we continue to invest aggressively in long-term growth initiatives. Additionally, we continue to anticipate fiscal year advertising spending to be about 11% of sales, spending closer to 10% in the front half of the year and 12% in the back half, in support of our robust innovation program. We now expect our fiscal year tax rate to be between 21% to 22%. Net of these factors, we now expect fiscal year \u201821 diluted EPS to increase between 5% to 8%, or $7.70 to $7.95 reflecting our assumption for stronger top line performance, partially offset by a rising cost environment. As we shared last quarter, our fiscal year diluted EPS outlook continues to include a contribution of $0.45 to $0.53 from our increased stake in our Saudi Arabia joint venture, primarily driven by a one-time non-cash gain. Excluding the impact of the Saudi acquisition, our fiscal year diluted EPS reflects strong investments behind the robust momentum we\u2019re seeing broadly in our portfolio. We\u2019re engaging new consumers, supporting back half innovation plans and expanding our portfolio into new channels and markets, all in support of our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth. In closing, I am pleased with our very strong start to fiscal year \u201821, both top and bottom line performance across our reporting segments. This provides a strong foundation for a continued momentum, which we plan to drive through aggressive investments in our IGNITE Strategy, in support of creating long-term shareholder value. And with that, I will turn it over to Linda. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Kevin. Hello everyone and thank you for being with us today. I hope you are well and in good spirits, as we continue to navigate this pandemic. It\u2019s great to be joining you on my first call as CEO, especially after the tremendous first quarter we delivered. Our results show what Clorox does best. We serve people who count on our brands, especially during a time when they need to feel safe, and when their home is the center of their world. This reinforces my first message, our outstanding results are a reflection of our team\u2019s dedication to serving consumers and communities. I am incredibly proud to see the broad based strength in our portfolio, with double-digit sales and profit growth in all reporting segments. In the last 8 months, all eyes have been on Clorox disinfecting products, and our brands delivered once again this quarter, with double-digit sales growth in our Cleaning and Professional Products businesses, reflecting continued higher usage of products in homes, businesses and healthcare settings. And now, we\u2019re also shining a brighter light on the terrific performance delivered by other parts of our portfolio, with double-digit sales growth in eight of 10 businesses, demonstrating the important role our brands play in addressing people\u2019s everyday needs. It\u2019s particularly gratifying to see great results from our Grilling and Glad businesses, as the team has been relentless in driving progress on our business plans, including meaningful innovation. Based on double-digit top line increases and significant margin expansion in our first quarter, we delivered very strong earnings growth for our shareholders and I\u2019m happy we were able to raise our fiscal year outlook. These results would not be possible without the passion and commitment of our Clorox teammates around the world. I\u2019m thankful and proud of how they live by our values, and take to heart our role, in supporting consumers and communities. While I feel good about our financial performance for the quarter, there is one thing that continues to keep me up at night. Our ongoing focus to meet unprecedented demand for much of our portfolio, we are certainly encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making in a number of businesses, including having Clorox Bleach mostly back on store shelves, but there is more work to be done. I can assure you that our teams are leaving no stone unturned across all businesses experiencing elevated demand. We\u2019re continuing to focus on products that can be made faster, and investing significantly in third party supply sources in an effort to expedite our products to retailers. Our consumers, retail partners and communities are counting on us, and I want people to know that maximizing supply continues to be top priority. Next the Clorox team and I will play 1% offense behind our strong portfolio of leading brands consumers love, in support of our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth. I feel privileged to be CEO of this special company and I have my sights set on extending our momentum longer term. In this uncertain environment, people are turning to brands they trust, and we\u2019re proud to have trusted brands in our categories. We\u2019re seeing this play out in strong helpful penetration, not just in our disinfecting products, but in many parts of our portfolio. For perspective, the percentage of our total portfolio was stable or growing household penetration has more than doubled year-over-year, and as I look beyond the pandemic and try to answer the question of whether or not we can sustain our strong results, I\u2019m encouraged by the trends we\u2019re seeing, particularly consumer behaviors formed during the last seven months. They are good indicators our brands will continue to play a meaningful role in people\u2019s daily life. For example, people are prioritizing Health and Wellness, drinking more water and taking vitamins and supplements, focusing on safety and hygiene, cleaning and disinfecting, in and out of their homes. Staying home more, including cooking, grilling, spending time with family and adopting a pet. Spending more time online with about 90% of people saying they\u2019ve shopped online since the pandemic. There are strong signs these behaviors will stick over the long term, as people have been building these habits for three times longer than it normally takes routines to form. And while early, we are encouraged by the strong repeat rates we are seeing across our portfolio, among core and new consumers. This is the time for 100% offense and that means investing significantly behind our global portfolio, including through advertising and market leading innovation. Increasing capital spending to expand production capacity in the near and long term and partnering with retailers, to enhance shopping experiences and grow our categories. With the strength of our global portfolio, the sustained consumer behaviors we are seeing and our significant investments to drive growth, Clorox is in a great position to keep winning with consumers. And finally, the defining opportunity for Clorox is simple, to serve even more people around the world, with the strategy that helps us make the most of who we are and where we have strategic advantage. Our IGNITE Strategy puts people at the center of everything we do, and fundamentally we will address consumer needs and follow them in the most meaningful ways we can. Here is what I would highlight Clorox is a health and wellness company at heart. With the strength of our brands and capabilities in disinfecting, we\u2019re in a great position to extend our role in public health. We will continue to lean into the strategic alliances we\u2019ve established with leading brands to keep their customers safe and we will certainly pursue more of these types of relationships with other organizations, to increase our support for people outside of their homes. I am also excited about expanding Clorox disinfecting wipes in International, supported by a dedicated supply chain that will allow us to scale this business in our existing markets and enter new geographies. More than ever, people are online and we believe digital behavior is here to stay. Clorox has leaned into e-commerce and digital marketing early, so that people can engage with our brands, in a more personal and relevant way. As people navigate a tough economy with pressures from unemployment and less discretionary spending, they\u2019ll continue to turn to brands they trust, and we\u2019ll continue to earn their trust and loyalty by focusing on superior value. And what\u2019s also important to me, is that we continue to be committed to growing the right way, guided by our values and with ESG embedded into our business. It\u2019s how we help our people our communities and our planet thrive now and in the future. Operator, you may now open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Hi, thank you and congrats everybody for the results. Linda, I was just following up from your comments and also Kevin on, kind of the momentum of the portfolio, and obviously you raised your guide for organic. But it does look like your EPS could have some room here. I was just trying to see if you can help us like gauge the level of investment, or perhaps some of the mix effect that we should be seeing, so that you kept your EPS relatively under control, given the gain that you had just to kind of parse out what part of it is investment in promo or just a mix effect? Thank you. Kevin Jacobsen : Hi Andrea, this is Kevin. I can talk about our EPS, as you think about the balance of the year. So as you mentioned, we\u2019ve raised our expectations for the year 5% to 8% off to a very strong start to the year. If you think about the impact of the balance of the year, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done the math, we are projecting we will be down in the back half of the year on our EPS year-over-year, that\u2019s primarily driven by the impact of the prior year. If you recall, we grew EPS, about 30% in the back half of fiscal year \u201820. So from the initial impact of COVID-19, the pantry loading, very strong results in the back half of the year. We have to lap that and in addition to lapping that, as we\u2019ve spoken in the last couple of calls, we are leaning in and investing behind the additional growth opportunities we see in front of us. And you may have heard in my prepared remarks, we think that advertising investment will be back-half loaded. So we would expect to be spending about 12% of sales in the back half. One, supporting a very robust innovation program we have teed up for the back half of the year, as well as pursuing a number of new growth initiatives, both our partnerships and some of the international opportunities we are spending behind. And maybe just a last comment I\u2019d make, Andrea, and I think you know this about us. We are certainly not looking to maximize one quarter, but making sure we\u2019re taking the right investments that generate long-term value. And so, we think there is a good opportunity for us to do that, and we will certainly do it in the back half of the year. Andrea Teixeira : That\u2019s fair. And if I can just ask about Professional, where do you think this business can become, as you are progressing with all these investments and new partnerships? Linda Rendle : Yes. Professional has been a strong part of our portfolio for a number of years, with high-single digit increases up to this point, and we continue to see a long runway for the business, both in the businesses that are established well today, in the Healthcare and Industrial customer setting, but also we\u2019re setting our sights on expanding the reach this business can have, as consumers start to leave their home and we can create environments, partnering with businesses to keep them safe. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on right now, is investing in the people to support that future growth, investing in the innovation to support that future growth, and of course investing in the brand, so that people continue to turn to the most trusted cleaning disinfecting brand with Clorox. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, both. Operator : Next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi, my first question is just sort of a follow-up to that, totally get the difficult comparison year-over-year in the March and June quarters, a 100%. But I also heard you call out higher commodities, and may be freight. And I just wanted to ask what your thoughts were on pricing, whether you plan to take price increases to offset some of those commodity increases, or whether you feel like the market is tentative and shaky enough, where it\u2019s better to potentially hold off on pricing? Linda Rendle : Yes, Wendy. Thanks for the question. We are committed to not taking pricing during the pandemic, it\u2019s to do the right thing and we want to make sure consumers have our products at the right value. And so what we\u2019re focused on right now, is a continued lean into our aggressive cost savings program that we\u2019ve had for a number of years, to ensure that we have the fuel to manage the investments that we have and of course to manage any bumpiness we expect in commodities. But we do expect cost increases through the back half as you said, and we\u2019re monitoring that environment closely. But again we are committed to ensuring that consumers have our brand during a recessionary time at the right value, not taking pricing during a pandemic and leveraging our cost savings program to manage through short-terms up and down. Wendy Nicholson : Got it. And that actually leads into my second question, which is kind of thinking sort of strategically, but also very much with an eye toward the dollars that you\u2019re investing in capacity. I mean clearly, there is a surge right now and the fact that you are signing so many agreements with the airlines or whatever, I mean clearly there is just a huge demand for disinfecting products and wipes in particular. But there will be a day when that passes. I\u2019m kind of curious just as you think about capital spending, are you hurrying to build capital to support demand that is I think going to be huge for some time to come, but is eventually going to fade. How do you think about that conceptually, so that you don\u2019t end up with a lot of capital, but ends up not being needed two years or three years down the road? Linda Rendle : Got it, Wendy. I think it would be helpful to step back and just talk a little bit about what we\u2019re seeing in the macro environment, and why we have strong belief that we\u2019re going to see a lot of these behaviors continue well into the future. We\u2019re seeing consumers in the U.S. and around the world, cleaning much more frequently, cleaning new surfaces and of course cleaning both in and outside of the home and that is true for business customers as well, where they\u2019re having to welcome people back to their businesses, with safe environment. From our research with consumers, they are telling us that they expect many of these behaviors to stick, regardless of whether or not, there is a vaccine or how long COVID goes on, because it\u2019s a way to reassure their health and wellness and for them to feel safe. So we\u2019re hearing from consumers that this is here to stay and we\u2019ve seen evidence of that in past pandemics, as well as just bad cold and flu seasons, where people have adopted new behaviors. The other thing I would tell you, in addition to capacity supporting just that change in behavior, we also see significant growth opportunities that are brand new to our business. Expanding Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and international, if you step back, we\u2019re in about 100 countries around the world with very little presence in disinfecting wipes. That\u2019s a big opportunity for us, complete white space that as we built capacity, we can lean into that even further. And the other thing that I would talk about is, in the industrial space, there\u2019s new technologies that we have, and we think those cleaning behaviors will need to change on a more permanent basis, to reassure people that it\u2019s safe to enter those businesses. And so that\u2019s the other thing I would just put in perspective. We can shift supply to the opportunities that are most poignant at the moment, as we move forward. And then of course Wendy, as you always know we\u2019re really good at balancing and spending capital in a disciplined way, and we can make adjustments to our network, whether that be through in-housing or working with third party manufacturers as we move forward, and we\u2019ve been very balanced in how we\u2019ve approached this, so that we can do just that. Wendy Nicholson : Great, thanks. Sounds terrific. Operator : Next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone and congrats on a really strong result. Just kind of building on Wendy\u2019s question a little bit. I wanted to kind of dig into the organic sales growth guidance. So not expecting think it\u2019s a wide range, but understandably so, up 5% to 9% core sales coming up from what was previously flat to up low-single digits in August. So can you dimension for us a bit, what\u2019s changed since early August? This is \u2013 retail is carrying higher inventory levels now in some of the higher demand category, an extremely strong quarter that was not anticipated in early August, with Kingsford as an example. Maybe just dimension for us, because the magnitude of the upward revision is noteworthy. Maybe just kind of dimensionalize for us a bit, what\u2019s driving the more bullish outlook? And then I have a follow-up for Kevin, on cash flow. Kevin Jacobsen : Hey Kevin, this is Kevin. I can take your first question as well, as it relates to sales. And to your point, we\u2019ve taken up our expectation for the balance of the year pretty materially. I think there is a number of things we are seeing that\u2019s giving us even more confidence for this year. The first is, we continue to see growing household penetration. So we are now three quarters into the pandemic in Q1, and it continued to grow. Additionally, we\u2019re seeing increased repeat purchase rates with both new and existing consumers, and so growing household penetration, accelerating repurchase rates, both giving us more confidence, and as you know, we\u2019ve been exploring a number of additional growth opportunities, both our partnerships, as well as expanding our disinfecting portfolio outside the U.S., and we\u2019re seeing more and more opportunity in both those spaces, that will start to contribute in the back half of the year. And then maybe the last time I\u2019d mentioned is, while we knew, we\u2019d have a very strong year as it relates to our disinfecting portfolio, we\u2019re seeing very strong results outside of disinfectant. I mean you clearly saw our results in our Household segment. Again, we\u2019re seeing users, more users coming into those categories, they\u2019re increasing their frequency of usage, and we think that\u2019s going to continue through the balance of the fiscal year. So I\u2019d say those are the key drivers that led to us taking up the outlook for the full year. Kevin Grundy : Got it. Alright, thanks Kevin. That\u2019s helpful. I have a number of questions, but I\u2019ll \u2013 just one more if I may. Just on with respect to balance sheet and cash flow, so through the cash balance is higher than you are normally carrying and the business typically needs, from a working capital perspective. Understanding is a lot the business is considering now with respect to additional capacity and so forth, but between the higher than normal cash balances, the business is throwing off a significant amount of cash from operations. Talk a little bit about if you were, just in terms of intentions with respect to capex and is there any intention to return to share buybacks as well, something that the company has kind of gotten away from a little bit in recent quarters, but now as we sort of move through the pandemic and there is greater visibility, it could be something that\u2019s potentially on the table. So, thanks for all that and I will pass it on. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. Happy to, Kevin, talk about cash. And as you mentioned, Kevin, we are seeing a pretty significant acceleration in the cash we are generating. Last year, our cash provided by operations was up about 56%. In Q1, it was up about 40%. We\u2019re sitting on just a little under $900 million of cash on the balance sheet, which to your point is more than we typically hold. That really gives us quite a bit of financial flexibility. So for Lind and I, job one will be to continue to look for opportunities to invest in our base business. We know that\u2019s where we can continue to create very strong returns for our shareholders. So we will do that, including investing more in capacity to the extent we think that\u2019s required. Additionally, we will continue to look for targeted M&A. We still have an interest in pursuing strategic acquisitions. The good news is, they don\u2019t feel like we have to do it to be successful, we got plenty of cash to pursue acquisitions to the extent we find a good opportunity. And then Kevin, you mentioned about share buybacks, we actually restart our share buybacks very modestly in the fourth quarter toward the end of the quarter, and in this quarter, we returned about $240 million to shareholders, combination of our dividend, plus about $100 million in share buybacks, that we assigned all to our dilution management program. So we are back in the market, I do expect that to continue. I expect this year, we will return around $900 million to shareholders, both in the form of our dividend, and our share repurchase program. But I think the key takeaway you should have is, the company continued to generate a significant amount of cash, and that gives us a lot of financial flexibility to pursue growth, both organically and inorganically. Kevin Grundy : Got it. Very helpful. Good luck. Kevin Jacobsen : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good afternoon folks. Thank you so much for spotting me in, very much appreciate it. A couple of quick questions. First, based on your prepared remarks, it sounds like you\u2019re still running behind demand in Health and Wellness, effectively selling everything you can make. In that context, the $800 million revenue you\u2019ve been able to reduce to and sell to the last few quarters, any reason to believe that would drop off, as we go into the second quarter? Kevin Jacobsen : Jason, this is Kevin. We expect to still continue to have very strong Q2. As you heard, we think we will be up double-digits. The one thing I\u2019d point to you is if you look at our Q1, we delivered 27% revenue growth. About 2 to 3 points was related to rebuilding retailer inventories. That was on Kingsford, our vitamins, minerals and supplements, as well as our Clorox liquid bleach. We\u2019ve made pretty good progress on catching up with demand on Clorox bleach, and so we rebuilt some capacity in Q1. So I\u2019d expect to have some impact on Q2. But beyond that I expect to see continued very strong performance in our cleaning portfolio, and that\u2019s \u2013 my comment is a global comment, not just in the U.S., but globally. Jason English : Got it. So maybe not, but we are probably not too far off is what I heard. Your full year guidance, from a reinvestment perspective, suggests that, if I look at A&P, and I just compare it sort of a clean year in fiscal \u201819, you\u2019re looking to spend roughly $180 million more in A&P than you did two years ago, and SG&A is expected to be up around $150 million than it was two years ago. As we think forward, how much of those costs do you expect to stick, and how many of them do you think you\u2019ll have the flexibility to retract, when and if demand begins to subside? Linda Rendle : Yes. Thanks Jason. I\u2019ll start with that. You know these investment levels are not a mandate in our business, they are a choice. And we\u2019re choosing to lean into the momentum we see in our portfolio right now, behind some of what Kevin covered. Household penetration has more than doubled the amount of our portfolio that\u2019s stable or growing. We have the highest ever consumer value measures, so \u2013 the percentage of people deem our products as superior. We are seeing people enter our categories at rates we\u2019ve never seen before, and we are seeing repeat, although it\u2019s early, strong. And so what we are trying to do by increasing our advertising and sales promotion spending, by increasing our admin spending, is about accelerating the long-term performance of the company, and that is what we are aspiring to do. And so it\u2019s a choice, it\u2019s not something that we have to do or that\u2019s dictated by the market, and we think it\u2019s a smart choice, because what it allows us to do, is hold on to new households and you know the customer acquisition is one of the toughest things we do in established categories that have high share. So we want to make sure that we\u2019re doing that. We see additional places where we can grow household penetration in the U.S. and beyond in our categories, and we want to ensure we\u2019re doing that. And then we want to support the behavior change that we see with consumers, whether it be in Health and Wellness, the fact that they\u2019re drinking more water or taking more supplements. In hygiene, the fact that they are cleaning more, the fact that they are cleaning new surfaces and they are doing it and inside and outside of the home, supporting behaviors, as people stay at home. So people have been delighted by the fact they get to cook and they are actually enjoying more time around the family meal table and they are able to use different methods of cooking, like grilling, during the week, not just on the weekend or a special occasion. So we think of this investment in both administrative spending and in A&SP, support keeping those new consumers in, bringing additional people into our franchise, in hopes that we can accelerate the long-term performance. But I just want to be clear, it\u2019s a choice, and it\u2019s always a choice that we can revisit, if these behaviors are not as sticky, and we can optimize. One other fact I\u2019d give you, Jason, because I think it\u2019s important. We went back and looked at our spending. Recall that we put about $70 million of incremental spending in the back half of fiscal year \u201820, and the return on investment was extremely strong, and it gave us confidence to lean in, in fiscal year \u201821, that this is both a good short term spend and long-term spend. Jason English : Super helpful. Thank you so much. Linda Rendle : Thanks Jason. Operator : Next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Thanks. Good afternoon. My first question is around the impact of volume growth and mix to gross margin that you called out because of volume growth. Could you talk about why it was such an outsized contributor this quarter versus last? Because volume was strong obviously, but only a point different versus Q4, and then on mix, I understand the aggregate benefit, but I suspect you saw gross margin improvement in each of your segments as well. So can you talk a little bit about promotion, whether that was a factor or lack thereof was a factor? Kevin Jacobsen : Hi Olivia. Yes, I can talk about those questions. Let me start with benefit of volume to gross margin. It was more impactful in Q1 as you said versus Q4. We got a little over 400 basis points of benefit to margin in the Q1. If you go back to Q4, it is about 350 basis points of benefit. And so, as we have seen our volume continue to grow, we delivered about 22% volume growth last quarter, and were up stronger this quarter. So we are seeing a little bit incremental benefit. And then on the mix side, the mix was really driven by business unit mix, as we shared with you in our prepared remarks. We saw a very strong growth from our Household segment, and that tends to have a higher revenue and higher margin, in those businesses, relative to the average for the company. So we have five points of favorable price mix. It was mostly all mix, and it was mostly driven by the strength of certain ones of our businesses growing at an accelerated rate. Olivia Tong : That\u2019s helpful. And then on consumption trends in your key categories, obviously like to moving parts we see still catch up to demand, in the Health and Wellness segment. But then, you are obviously going to have some volatile comps in household, but specific to household, can you just talk about the drivers of the acceleration there, because the comp was easier, but it was two points easier versus Q4 and you accelerated growth by over 20 points. So how much of this is related to exogenous factors like COVID and more time at home or an active outdoor season, versus attracting new consumers to the categories of your brands. And what do you think is sort of a sustainable growth rate for the household business going forward? Linda Rendle : Olivia, I will highlight two businesses. I will highlight Grilling and Glad as good examples of what we have done, and what our expectations are moving forward. So grilling more than doubled sales, as we talked about, and this was due mainly to strong consumption. We did see some inventory replenishment, but that was about a third of what we saw from a sales growth perspective. And what\u2019s going on, are two factors that are coming together really nicely. We spoke about in our Investor Day in October, the fact that we were rebuilding our business plan on Grilling from the ground up. And that was based on business plans that we are in partnership with retailers to grow categories, and fundamentally reinventing our innovation program on grilling. And that has worked very well. You combine that with new behaviors we are seeing in the grilling category and that\u2019s really where we got to the place, where we experienced double-digit sales growth. And what we are seeing from consumers is this, about three quarters of people, even as mobility has increased in the U.S., are continuing to cook at home and expect to continue to cook at home, as they move forward. We are seeing 50% of charcoal grillers, grill more during COVID, and the vast majority of those, expect to continue to grill more, regardless of whether or not COVID is around in the near future, or farther ahead. And the most exciting thing for us, is we are seeing grilling occasions become everyday meal occasions. So before, most of the time when people were grilling, it was for the weekends, gatherings outside for holidays, and now we are seeing the grill being used for everyday occasions, and we expect that trend to continue. So those two things coming together, a revival of our business plans, having the right merchandising plans in place, and there was very little price discounting during this entire period of COVID, and we still saw the volumes hold steady and the sales increase that we experienced. So we think that behavior is here to stay, and based on the innovation we have planned over the coming years, we anticipate that we will be able to meet these consumer behavior change needs and continue to grow the grilling category. And if we look at Glad, it\u2019s a similar story. We were back focusing on the fundamentals of price gaps, innovation, ensuring that we have the right distribution, and that has paid off for us in addition to the consumer trends we\u2019re seeing. So up digital double digits behind strong consumer demand, and this is really about consumer staying home more and cooking more. So what we have heard, is people are using more trash bags, because they\u2019re generating more trash. So purchase frequency is up for Glad in particular, and about a third of households claim to be using, at least one full bag of kitchen trash per week. And as people have told us, they continue to cook at home, in the future, we expect that to continue. The other thing I would call out on Glad, is the innovation that supporting people through this time, as Lisah highlighted in her prepared comments, we launched Glad ForceFlex with Clorox and that\u2019s doing extremely well. It\u2019s early days, but we\u2019re seeing really good consumer acceptance, as well as the Glad bags we launched in Q3, that are experiential with both [indiscernible] and color, those continue to have very strong velocities and are supporting consumers during this time. One other thing I would call out, which I think is exciting for this business, is we have seen household penetration increases in Glad, and we\u2019ve seen higher household pen increases from low-income consumers. So we are offering them the right value at the right time, as they stay home. And if we look to the future and we think about what these businesses can do, we certainly see additional room for us, to grow household penetration, and for us to continue to retain those consumers, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re leaning in and investing in innovation and leaning in and investing in advertising. But what we would expect in the back half, as we lap a strong comp is, we would see that growth rate come down, but if you compare this period versus pre-COVID, say fiscal year \u201819 we\u2019re still experiencing very strong growth. Olivia Tong : Thanks. Congrats on a great quarter. Operator : Next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Yes. Hey, thanks. A couple of quick follow-ups, if I could and then I actually really want to ask about the international supply chain in wipes, but just to clean up what you were just talking about to Olivia? The Household and Lifestyle, you mentioned the inventory catch-up, can you just confirm whether those inventories were back in balance actually in the quarter, or whether there are any lingering pockets of dislocation we should be aware of? Linda Rendle : For Grilling, we have mainly gotten back to a point where we are in supply, and given this is the smaller quarter for Kingsford coming up, just given seasonality, we think we are in a good position moving forward. We still have some work to do on Glad, and still have additional work to do on Vitamins Minerals and Supplements and Brita. So we are not out of the woods yet and what we will say is, it will be a staggered recovery across those businesses that we have remaining over the next two quarters. Steve Powers : Okay. That helps. And then on the international supply chain in wipes, can you give us a little bit more detail us to what that looks like as we stand here today? How expensive it is? How much is in-sourced versus, I presume, most of it outsourced, but just some color there? And then how is that may be likely to change over time, as you build out against the opportunities that you spotlighted? Linda Rendle : Happy to. Yes, this supply chain was incredibly important for us to build it local, in-market, so that we could react to the opportunities we saw quickly, and we stood the supply chain up in just a matter of months, and we already have product shipping into countries today. We do have locations around the world, where we are supplying, because again we have business in Latin America and Asia, and so we are thinking about that expansion, ensuring that we have a distribution availability in that market. We also have designed this product from the ground up as well specifically for the consumer in those markets. So the needs can be a little bit different, depending on the country that you are in, the size of the wipe, the way that they want the lotion to feel. So again, did that within a matter of months and stood it up. We will continue to be flexible. Just as we have built this business in the U.S. over the last 20 years, as we expand in International, we will have all of those things under consideration, how much makes sense for us to have in-house, how much it makes sense to have with third-party suppliers. But the good news about this is, we find the supply chain to be scalable, and will lean in and pursue this opportunity aggressively, because we think our products can help so many more people around the world. Steve Powers : Okay. Thanks Linda. Appreciate it. I will leave it there. Linda Rendle : Thanks. Operator : Next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Jonathan, your line is open. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thank you. I guess I wanted first off I wanted to talk about untracked channel dynamics, because you were helpful in sharing that about two to three points of the sales growth this quarter was related to restocking retail inventories. But there is still kind of even outside of that, a number of these businesses that really don\u2019t tie to what\u2019s showing up in Nielsen. So I was curious, I guess, if there is new distribution, we should be aware of for Glad or for Kingsford, in particular, and if not just you know is the performance offline dramatically different \u2013 sorry, on track, dramatically different than tracked? Linda Rendle : Sure Lauren. Happy to start on that one. So I think it\u2019s safe to say that the relationship in our performance in tracked channels and on track is going to be less linear over time, and is certainly less linear in Q1. But I think it would be helpful to back up and just set the backdrop for what we\u2019ve seen in fiscal year \u201820 and then specifically get into Q1 and then our expectations on this one moving forward. So if you back up in fiscal year \u201820 tracked channels for us as a total company, including international and our professional products business, represented about 60% of total company sales. 80% of total U.S. retail is in tracked channels. And what happened this quarter is, we had strong growth in professional products in international and that accounts for about a quarter of our sales growth, which of course is not accounted for in Nielsen as you highlighted. But if you looked at tracked and non-tracked channels, those growth rates were about the same at about 20%, and that makes sense, because we have been on allocation for a number of our businesses, so you would expect to see both of those at about the same rate. But as you mentioned, Kevin called out inventory, and as we started to replenish inventory and businesses like Kingsford, Brita, Bleach and Vitamins. Minerals and Supplements, that accounted for about two to three points this quarter of the disconnect. We also had a year ago inventory effect, if you think about grilling, because last year we had the inventory, this year we have low inventory and heavy sales that we were replenishing that consumption, and you saw a disconnect in Grilling. And then the one other thing I would call out for you Lauren is promotional periods versus year ago, and I would really caution everybody against using narrow time periods like a week or four weeks, because those periods have changed year-over-year and it causes noise in the data, as well as the fact that we were not merchandising anything in our cleaning and disinfecting portfolio, given our supply. So those two factors both inventory and promotional also contributed. And then going forward, we\u2019d expect this disconnect to continue, because we expect strong growth from international, strong growth from professional products. And then as more consumers move online, more of that will be on track. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, that\u2019s super helpful. And then the other question that was a little bit longer term. So historically, right, a key kind of mantra for Clorox was big share brands in mid-sized categories, right, and that\u2019s still in your investor slide deck and still kind of how you talked about your business. The thing though, is that, your previously mid-sized categories are becoming really big categories, where everybody wants to participate. So I guess, Linda, wanted to talk a little bit about how you may be factoring that change in, whether it\u2019s competitive dynamics, overall category size, attention being paid to these businesses where you\u2019ve kind of been able to operate at a very high level, but arguably with a bit less competitive intensity historically, then may be the case going forward? Linda Rendle : Sure Lauren. Let me try to take that in a couple of buckets, and start first with just your portfolio question. And I feel terrific about our portfolio. If you look at the broad-based growth we had, eight out of 10 businesses with double-digit sales growth, growing most businesses expansion and household penetration, strong consumer value measure across those businesses. I think our portfolio is in a terrific place to be competitive. And then if I answer your question around big share brands in mid-sized categories, I do think that\u2019s what we are still about. And these categories, even though there is a lot of attractiveness, are still relatively small to some of the categories in store, and even with the growth rates we have been experiencing, we would still consider them to be mid-sized. And then if I think about competition, maybe I would disagree a little bit, Lauren. I think our categories have been competitive for quite a long time. We have had national players, if you think about Cleaning, in that businesses, certainly internationally for a long time, people have entered in our space and wipes before several times. So I think that\u2019s going to continue to be competitive, and to your point, will be more competitive in the near future, because it\u2019s a very attractive place to play right now. And what we turn back to, is really what separates us and how we think we can win, and that starts with having strong brands that consumers love, and that they are loyal to. And as I highlighted at the beginning, those factors around the health of the portfolio, our household penetration, our consumer value measure scores, how we\u2019re seeing people enter our categories give us reassurance that we have the right brands to win in that space. And then Ignite really elevates the role of innovation, and I think that\u2019s going to be critical for us to win in the future in these categories. People\u2019s needs are changing. Their behaviors are changing, and we need to innovate to meet those new needs and we\u2019re feeling terrific about the innovation program we have in place now. About the innovation, you can expect to see in the back half of fiscal year \u201821 and then well beyond that, we\u2019re feeling great about that. So for us, again that moment is about investing right now and leaning into the strength of those brands, knowing it\u2019s going to be more competitive, focusing relentlessly on superior consumer value, and ensuring that people know that our brands offer them the very best, when it comes to meeting their needs today as they deal with COVID, and staying home more. Does that help answer your question Lauren? Lauren Lieberman : It does. Yes, thank you so much Linda. Linda Rendle : Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] I have a question from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please go ahead. Jonathan Feeney : Hey thanks for fitting me, and sorry about that. I had some technical difficulties, pretty more than the usual, great quarter. Just \u2013 and I apologize if this has been asked, does your 27% organic sales gain in your opinion represent any data you have, a share gain on a weighted basis versus your categories? Because I am trying to figure out where you stand, particularly in cleaning but broadly, and then as a related question, what\u2019s your current share of sales right now in e-commerce, which would probably be your fastest growing and highest contributive non-measured sales? Thanks very much. Linda Rendle : Sure. Jonathan, I think we can\u2019t answer the question of folks, we have categories that don\u2019t have relevant track share data that we can quantify so Professional Products is a good example and international. But I think if you look at all outlets, we are in a place where share is about flat right now and most of that is due to supply constraints and we would anticipate, if we were in a position to better supply across those categories, to see improvement on that, and I know you know that we hold all of our businesses accountable to growing share. So that\u2019s what I would say about the first part of your question. And then, what I think about moving forward, and how we are anticipating looking at that we are trying to see, is in the very narrow buckets that we compete in, whether that be online or out of home, how are we doing in that individual space, because it\u2019s hard to aggregate this and understand what we\u2019re doing broadly. So we\u2019re looking country by country. We are looking at specific channels in our professional business to see how we are doing, and then we are looking at online. Online specifically about two-thirds of our brands are number one share online, which lines up nicely with the rest of our portfolio, and we\u2019re doing very well there. And that has to do with the early investments we made in e-commerce. We were one of the first to stand up a fully dedicated team on e-commerce pure play customers, as well as standing up integrated teams on our brick and click customers. So we\u2019re in a very good position online, as consumers continue to move online, we will continue to invest there. And you know, the one other thing I would point out is, we have been spending over 60% of our dollars online for a number of years. So we are where shoppers are today, and that has helped contribute to that share expansion. Jonathan Feeney : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And this concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle, I would now like to turn the program back over to you. Linda Rendle : Thank you so much, Sharon. I feel great about our strong start to fiscal year \u201821 and look forward to another year of delivering value to all our stakeholders. Thank you so much everyone, and we will speak again on our next call in February. We hope you all stay well. Take care. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Clorox Company Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. Lisah Burhan : Thank you, Sharon. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining us today. We hope you and your families are continuing to stay safe and well. On the call with me today are Linda Rendle, our CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. Now a few reminders before we go into results. We're broadcasting this call over the internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected or potential impact of COVID-19. These statements are based on management's current expectation, but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements, and the non-GAAP financial information section, including the tables that reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, both of which are located at the end of today's earnings release, which has also been posted on our website and filed with the SEC. I'll start by covering our usual top-line commentary with highlights from each of our segments. Kevin will then address our total company results, as well as our FY 2021 outlook. Finally, Linda will offer her perspective and we'll close with Q&A. For the total company, Q2 sales increased 27% with growth in every reportable segment. It reflects about 1 point of net benefit from the July acquisition that gives us a majority share in our Saudi Arabia joint venture and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. On an organic basis, Q2 sales grew 26%. I will now go through our results by segment. In our Health and Wellness segment, Q2 sales were up 42% reflecting double digits increases in two of three businesses. Our Cleaning business had double digit sales growth behind strong ongoing demand across our portfolio. Consumption remains high and importantly we're continuing to see increases in household penetration and repeat rates among existing and new users driven by new routines developed from the prolonged pandemic as well as strategic brand investments. While we expect tough comparisons as we let these very high growth rates, we'll continue to work to retain the larger base of loyal consumers we've built for our cleaning and disinfecting products even after a critical mass of the population has been vaccinated. We're continuing to make progress on our supply expansion, including a new line of wipes plant coming online this quarter. We're also continuing to identify new sources of supply for other products experiencing constraints, including our disinfecting spray products. As we're able to better meet consumer demands for our base products, we're looking forward to bringing back our Clorox compostable wipes along with a stream of exciting innovation in the coming months. Our professional products business had another quarter of double-digit sales growth behind continued high demand for our cleaning and disinfecting products. It's worth noting though that while demand from businesses such as healthcare facilities has remained high. We've seen softer demand from businesses negatively impacted by ongoing mobility restrictions like commercial cleaning and food service institutions. That's why we're leaning into other out-of-home spaces through strategic alliances and are encouraged by our progress. While not yet a meaningful contributor in Q2, our out-of-home partnerships are expanding. We're excited to announce a new multi-year deal with the NBA and existing partner. Lastly, within this segment, our sales in vitamins, minerals and supplements business decreased in Q2. This is a business where results have not been consistent and we clearly have more work to do. As you remember, we relaunched RenewLife last fall. While we've seen improvements in all outlet consumption, it is not yet delivering the consistent results we want. With more than half American consumers saying they intend to continue taking vitamins and supplements, we continue to believe in the attractiveness of this category. Now turning to Household segment. Quarterly sales were up 20% with growth in all three businesses for a third consecutive quarter. Grilling sales were up double digits driven by continued strong consumption, which reflects the dramatic rise in in-home meal occasion as people continue to spend more time at home. Behind our strategic collaboration with retailers, we've been able to grow household penetration for a third consecutive quarter including among millennials and low income consumers. As we begin planning for the next grilling season, we're building on our innovation through expanded distribution of our new Kingsford pellets and bringing new flavors to our Kingsford product lineup. With consumer spending more on their backyards and backyards and grills, we feel optimistic about the future of this business. Cat Litter sales were up by double digits in Q2 supported by innovation and continued strong performance online. Our Fresh Step with Gain Original Scented Litter with the power of Febreze as well as our Fresh Step Clean Paws Litter continued to perform very well and we're supporting them through a new advertising campaign. A record number of people have become pet parents since the onset of the pandemic in 2020. Making this yet another example of how our diverse portfolio is particularly suited to the times. Glad sales increased in Q2 behind strong demands across our portfolio of trash bags, wraps and food bags as people continue to spend more time at home. Our latest innovation Glad ForceFlex with Clorox trash bags launched in September and is building distribution quickly earning positive reviews. In our lifestyle segment, Q2 sales were up 9% with double digit growth in two of three businesses. Brita sales were up by double digits for a fourth consecutive quarter behind continued strong shipments of pitchers as well as filters. Just as with wipes and sprays, we're continuing to work through supply chain constraints in our Brita business, which has been impacting our shares. We feel good about the long-term prospects of this business especially since once people buy a Brita pitcher, they tend to stay in our franchise with continued purchases of filters. Importantly, as household penetration for Brita keeps growing, we're building brand loyalty among these consumers. The food business had double digit sales increase for a third straight quarter behind ongoing strong consumption of our Hidden Valley Ranch products, particularly dry seasoning and bottle dressings. With more and more people eating at home during the pandemic, household penetration has grown to an all-time high, including above average growth among millennials. We're building on this momentum with a stream of innovation, including Hidden Valley secret sauces, and most recently Hidden Valley Plant based Ranch dressing, which has been supported by strong advertising investments. Burt's Bees sales decreased by double digits as the business continued to be impacted by mobility restrictions as well as changes to consumer shopping and usage habits as a result of the pandemic. This quarter unseasonably warm weather also impacted lip balm sales. Despite these challenges, we're making progress in the fast-growing online channel where the brand had double digit growth in Q2, and we remain confident in the long-term trajectory of this business. Lastly, in international, Q2 sales grew 23% driven by double digit shipment growth in all major regions. The growth reflects about 9 points of benefit from the Saudi acquisition and about 4 points of unfavorable foreign currency headwinds. Organic sales grew 18%. The recent investment we made to create a dedicated international supply chain for Clorox disinfecting wipes is starting to pay off giving us the ability to not only meet ongoing elevated demand in existing markets, but also to expand to new countries. This is a strategic growth platform for the company and we're supporting it through additional advertising investments. Now, I'll turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss Q2 results as well as updated outlook for FY 2021. Kevin Jacobsen : Thank you, Lisah, and thank you everyone for joining us today. We hope you and your families are well. Our sales growth for the second quarter was broad-based resulting in double digit growth in each reporting segment for the first half of our fiscal year. Additionally, this led to profitable growth for the first half, which enables us to capitalize on momentum and continue investing behind our global portfolio to strengthen our competitive advantage. As you saw in our press release, we've raised our fiscal year 2021 outlook given the strength of our first half results and our expectation for continued strong demand across our global portfolio over the balance of the year. Turning to our second quarter results, second quarter sales were up 27%, driven by 23 points of organic volume growth, 3 points of favorable price mix and 1 point of net benefit from requiring majority control of our Saudi joint venture partially offset by FX headwinds. On an organic basis, sales grew 26%. Gross margin for the quarter increased 130 basis points to 45.4% compared to 44.1% in the year ago quarter. Second quarter gross margin included the benefit of strong volume growth, as well as 160 basis points of cost savings and 140 basis points of favorable mix. These factors were partially offset by 420 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, which were similar to last quarter, included temporary COVID-19 spending. Second quarter gross margin results also reflect about 50 basis points of negative impact from higher commodity costs, primarily from resin. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 14.6% compared to 14.5% in the year ago quarter. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at about 10%. We're spending for our U.S. retail business coming in at 11% of sales. This reflect higher investments across our portfolio, strengthening our value proposition to support higher levels of household penetration and lasting brand loyalty among new and existing consumers. Our second quarter effective tax rate was 21%, which was equal to the year ago quarter. Net of these factors we delivered diluted net earnings per share of $2.03 versus $1.46 in the year ago quarter, increase of 39%. As you also saw in our press release year-to-date net cash provided by operations was $629 million versus $498 million in the year ago period, an increase of 26%. Turning to our fiscal year outlook; we now anticipate fiscal year sales to grow between 10% to 13%; reflecting the strength of our first half results and higher expectations for the back-half. With our overall demand for our products remaining quite strong, we now expect back-half sales to be about flat on top of 19% growth in a year ago period. We also anticipate about one point of contribution from our Saudi joint venture, offset by one point of foreign exchange headwinds. On an organic sales basis, our outlook assumes 10% to 13% growth. We now expect fiscal year gross margin to be down slightly, reflecting higher commodity and manufacturing logistics costs as well as temporary costs related to COVID-19. These factors are expected to be partially offset by higher sales. As a reminder, we expect gross margin contraction over the balance of the fiscal year. Primarily from two factors; first, we're lapping very strong operating leverage from robust shipment growth during the initial phase of the pandemic. And second we're facing commodity headwinds this year versus last year's commodity tailwinds. As reminder, our gross margin expanded 250 basis points in the back-half of this year 2020. We continue to expect fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to be about 14% of sales, reflecting ongoing aggressive investments and long-term profitable growth initiatives and incentive compensation costs consistent with our pay for performance philosophy. Additionally, we continue to anticipate fiscal year advertising spending to be about 11% of sales. We spent about 10% in the front half of the year and continue to anticipate about 12% in the back-half in support of our robust innovation program. We continue to expect our fiscal year tax rate to be between 21% to 22%. Net of these factors we now expect fiscal year 2021 diluted EPS to increase between $8.05 and $8.25 or 9% to 12% growth reflecting strong top line performance, partially offset by a rising cost environment. We now anticipate fiscal year diluted EPS outlook to include a contribution of $0.45 to $0.50 from our increased stake in our Saudi Arabia joint venture, primarily driven by a one-time non-cash gain. I'm pleased we've raised our fiscal year 2021 outlook. Of course, it's important to note we continue to operate in a highly dynamic environment and our monitoring headwinds that could result in impacts moving forward. In closing, I'm also pleased with our broad-based strong results in the first half, which enables us to continue investing in our brands, capabilities and new growth opportunities, all in support of our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Linda. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Kevin. Hello everyone, and thank you for being with us today. I hope you and your families are well. It's great to be here today sharing Clorox's results for the first half of our fiscal year. My messages this quarter are largely reinforced what we discussed in Q1 with the most important point being that our global portfolio of leading brands continues to play a critical role in people's everyday lives. My first message is that our first half results are rooted in purpose driven growth. Our purpose as a company is to champion people to be well and thrive every single day. And our portfolio of leading brands is the bedrock of our ability to deliver on that promise. Our first half results reinforce the important role our brands play in addressing people's everyday needs. We continue to see broad-based strength in our portfolio with double-digit sales growth for most of our businesses. Clorox disinfecting products continue to be in high demand among consumers, businesses, and healthcare settings. And as people spend more time at home, we're continuing to see strong performance in other parts of our portfolio. Kingsford is a great example. As Lisah mentioned, our Grilling business delivered double-digit sales growth in the quarter, and with a recharge strategy emphasizing innovation. I'm optimistic about the long-term prospects of this business. Before I move on to my second message, I want to thank the Clorox team around the world who shows up every day to live our purpose. They understand that more than ever people and communities need us. I'm so grateful for their passion and commitment. My second message is that Clorox will stay in the driver's seat, continuing our posture of 100% offense to make the most of the opportunities in front of us, while navigating an ongoing dynamic environment. There's no question Clorox has built significant momentum over the last year, and we have every intention of extending that longer term. Our brand portfolio is especially relevant for this environment and for the consumer trends I mentioned last quarter, which we expect to persist beyond the pandemic. Prioritizing hygiene and health and wellness, caring for pets and accelerating digital behaviors related to practically every aspect of their lives. More than ever as homes where the hardest, it's also where consumers are directing their investments. We are spending across many categories to support quality of in-home experiences. This certainly bodes well for our portfolio. We continue to see strong levels of household penetration. Importantly, what we mentioned last quarter about repeat rates across our portfolio is playing out. We're accelerating purchase frequency and repeat users are the source of most of our sales growth across our portfolio. In addition, our strategic investments are creating a virtuous cycle around engaging and retaining new and existing users resulting in a consumer retention rate of nearly 90%. As I mentioned, 100% offense will help us extend this momentum, which as a reminder includes investing more across our portfolio to retain the millions of people buying our brands. Expanding our public health support to more out of home spaces, increase in capital spending for immediate and future production capacity, including wipes expansion in the international, and partnering with our retailers to grow our category. Given the dynamic environment we continue to face, 100% offense also means actively planning for challenges and disruptions in the near and long-term, including an inflationary cost environment, elevated competition in light of category tailwinds and accelerating advancements in digital technology that we expect to impact all areas of our business. What's important is we'll continue to make strategic choices that position us to achieve our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth. And finally, my third message is this. As we continue to address immediate priorities related to unprecedented demand, we're also accelerating our progress against our strategy to deliver long-term shareholder value. Our IGNITE strategy continues to put people at the center of everything we do, and helps us make the most of our strategic advantage in the near and long-term. Addressing unprecedented consumer demand for much of our portfolio continues to be an immediate priority. We continue to make progress on a number of businesses. We're bringing in more third party supply sources and launching our new wipes line in our Atlanta facility in the third quarter. Importantly, simplification is our mantra and we're seeing the benefit of focusing on fewer skews, which we expect to continue beyond the pandemic. As I mentioned earlier, we're going Clorox's disinfecting wipes international supported by a dedicated supply chain. Our expansion plans are going very well, and we expect to double the number of countries where Clorox wipes are sold. Another immediate priority is to continue supporting people's safety when they're outside their homes through strategic alliances to support public health. We're expanding our programs with Uber Technologies and Enterprise Holdings. We recently established a multi-year deal with the NBA and look forward to pursuing similar opportunities with other organizations. And as the pandemic continues to take a toll on the economy, we know that far too many people feel financial pressure from unemployment and less discretionary spending. We're mindful of the role we can play to support those who are particularly value sensitive and we'll continue to deliver superior value through meaningful innovation. Importantly, we're also making progress in laying the foundation for long-term growth. We will continue to invest strongly in our global portfolio of leading brands, particularly behind robust innovation that differentiates our products and deliver superior value. We will continue to re-imagine how we work to ensure a strong culture with a highly engaged team that works simpler and faster on strategic priorities. I'm proud of how we've been operating during the pandemic, including accelerating our speed-to-market. And finally, as we said before we view ESG as a contributor to competitive advantage, which is why it's embedded in our business. Achievements this quarter include being included in the 2021 Bloomberg gender equality index, achieving 100% renewable electricity in the U.S. and Canada four years early. Signing on to the energy buyer, federal clean energy policy statement, which calls for a 100% clean energy power sector and donating $1 million to Cleveland Clinic to establish the Clorox public health research grant in support of science-based public health research. We are grateful to play a role in supporting people and communities as we continue to navigate the global pandemic. It only strengthens our resolve in pursuing purpose driven growth, ensuring a strategic link between our impact on the world and long-term value creation for our shareholders. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Andrea Teixeira with J.P. Morgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. And I hope you and your families are doing well. So I was hoping if you can give us an idea of the shipments, I guess consumption into the second half [indiscernible] to replenishing the trade or if the fuel rates have normalized at this point. I've remember Linda you mentioned that in the last call. And asking a different way, how much more capacity including third parties you mentioned in the call, have you added in the second half against the second half of the last fiscal? So it seems around 25% by my math in the U.S. which implies that you could still grow volumes in the low-single digits in this upcoming second half of fiscal, if demand remained strong. I understand that obviously you're giving us a flat top line for the second half because you're embedding some deceleration. So how we should be thinking of that and conversely, if you're regaining share, because you lost some share, given the stockouts how we should be thinking of your capacity and fulfillment into the second half? Thank you. Kevin Jacobsen : Andrea, this is Kevin. I can start and Linda can jump in as well. Maybe I'll start with the question on retail inventory levels, and I might broaden it to talk about both inventory levels and the extent of supply chain, both in our warehouse as well as retailers. What I'd tell you is we think we've made pretty good progress over the first half of this fiscal year. And I'd say by and large, we feel pretty good about retail inventory levels with some notable exceptions, there's still portions of our home care portfolio particularly our disinfecting wipes and portions of our disinfecting spray trigger products that we're still not at a point where we can fully meet demand. And in the other area, we still have work to do to catch-up as an Brita. That business continues to perform quite well. We've had four straight quarters of double digit growth, and so we're still not in a position where we can fully support demand on that product. But with the exception of those businesses, I think generally I feel pretty good about retail inventory levels and additionally feel pretty good about inventory levels in our facilities. I would say on Brita, I think we've got a couple more quarters before we think we can catch up. I think by the end of this fiscal year, we'll be in a better position in terms of meeting retail demand. And then I think particularly on our wipes business, it's going to take a while, likely the end of this calendar year we'll be in a position to fully service demand. And then on capacity, you had a question on capacity, Andrea? As Linda said in her prepared remarks, we are starting up our second line at our Georgia wipes facility and that's happening this quarter. And you'll see that start to ramp-up over the next several quarters. Our expectation is by the end of the fiscal year, we'll have more than doubled our wipes capacity from where we were before the pandemic started. And that's a combination of bringing on our facility that's happening now, as well as we continue to bring on additional contract manufacturers. And in Q2, we added more contract manufacturers as well. So we're working both with self manufacturing, as well as third-party manufacturing. That work will continue, well past this fiscal year. Linda Rendle : Andrea, I'll just add on the shared question, which I think you were connecting this to, which is exactly what we're watching closely. You started to see our share improvement in quarter two. So we're up as a total company, eight-tenths of a point that's up from 52 weeks share of being up a half a point, but what's really encouraging to us as if we dive deeper into the businesses that we have gotten back to an in-stock position on. So starting outside of cleaning, if you look at our Hidden Valley ranch business, cat litter and Kingsford all of them growing share, as we've gotten supplied back up to a place where we can meet demand. And then really encouragingly, if you look at our cleaning business, although we have a ways to go until we can fully meet demand in places where we've been able to improve, we're seeing significant share gains to our Clorox clean-up business, which is a spray, is up eight share points in the spray business in Q2. Clorox Manual Toilet Bowl Cleaner up four points, our Pine-Sol business up 2.5 points, and that corresponds with strong plans we have in place, but also our ability to supply. Andrea Teixeira : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi. My first question is regarding gross margin. The 420 basis points pressure that you called out for manufacturing and logistics costs. How much of that specifically was related to COVID and how much longer do you think that will be with us? What I'm trying to get a handle on is kind of gross margin as we look into 2022, what's the right run rate? And is there opportunity for margins to recover as we go into the next fiscal year? Kevin Jacobsen : Hi, Wendy. Yes, as it relates to the impact of COVID in Q2 was about 90 basis points. What we believe is on a full year basis, it's probably 50 basis point to 75 basis point hit to gross margin. It was higher going forward. We think over time we'll be able to step out of these costs. They're really in two buckets, we continue to expedite transportation and that comes at a higher cost as we're trying to fulfill retail orders as quickly as we can in our supply challenge environment. So there's some increased costs there, as well as the increased spending we're doing with our production team to make sure we're keeping folks safe with increased hygiene activity, as well as enhanced benefits. I think over time as we get through the pandemic and that may push you into fiscal year 2022 for us, but as we move through the pandemic, we'll be able to step out of a good portion of those charges going forward. Wendy Nicholson : Got it. And this \u2013 the shipments of wipes into the international markets, I assume that's going to be great over the long-term and there's probably even lower household penetration of wipes overseas than there is in the U.S. But I assume you're sourcing that \u2013 are you sourcing that from a third parties? I'm wondering if I know it's a small number, but is that accretive or dilutive to margins over the next 12 months to 18 months? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. Wendy, on wipes it's as we've mentioned, we've stood up a dedicated supply chain internationally. We used to supply our international wipes out of the U.S. so it had a very long supply chain and that came at an increased cost. We've now stood up a supply chain much closer to our markets we're serving. And so I think over time, that's going to be a nice addition to that international portfolio as we build out that, that business. It really just started in Q2. We saw some really nice performance in the second quarter. I think this is a long-term growth runway for us. So you'll see that continue to build through the balance of this year and frankly, that'll continue to build for the next several years. Wendy Nicholson : Fantastic. And then I don't mean to be a hog, but I just want to sneak in one for Linda. The VMS business, I get why it fits in with sort of the strategy and mission of the company health and wellness focus. And I get that the category itself is attractive, but I'm still not totally convinced that it belongs in your portfolio, that Clorox has the core competencies to make the VMS business a success? So can you talk about that, maybe your willingness to throw in the towel and not focus on that business anymore? Linda Rendle : Hi, Wendy. Thanks for the question. I'll just start with, and you said it, our results have been inconsistent and I'm not satisfied with that, and that is full stop. But if you look at the thesis and you started to talk about this, we really do see these categories being a long-term growth runway for us. And that's why we got into these businesses to start because we see it a nice fit in our overall journey to help people be well and thrive. What we've learned over the last few years as we've operated these is, we made the choice to buy some small brands in a very large $12 billion space. And it's certainly been a hotbed for competition and the lesson we've learned is the ramp-up for the brands is just longer than we thought it was going to be. We see pockets of encouraging results in our renew life relaunch for example in our magnesium supplement business, but there are other places where we're not as satisfied. So, if I take a long-term view to this, we still think these categories are attractive. We still see our ability to innovate, brand build really meaningful in a slew of a lot of things that are going on in therapy. Good claims, good science, but I think the perspective is VMS still only represents about 4% of our business and it's going to take a while before it's a meaningful contributor and we're going to be patients. But I still feel conviction that these are attractive categories too compete. Wendy Nicholson : Fair enough. Thank you very much. Operator : Next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. So I just wanted to touch on the trash bag business. If you could just kind of give us a state of the union in terms of what's going on in terms of shelf space. I understand there's been some pricing taken on the category. And Linda, last quarter you indicated, you were hesitant to take pricing during a pandemic, but just wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about it now, given you're starting to see inflation happen at a much more meaningful rate? Thank you. Linda Rendle : Nik, thanks for the question. So Q2 was another strong quarter for Glad. It grew nicely behind continued strong demand from consumers. We're seeing really good signs of brand health. So our household penetration, up almost a point and a half increased by our retention rates. We're growing repeat rates on the Glad business. So the fundamentals of that business continue to be very strong. You're seeing price gaps where we'd want them to be. And I think what continues to be the differentiator for glad is innovation. It's working really well in the market for us, whether that be our experiential trash bag or if that is our new skew Glad or selects with Clorox are all doing really well. And so as we've said, this is a business where you have to innovate, where you have to bring new benefits to the category and that continues to work well for us. I think if you take a step back and maybe this is a comment agnostic of Glad if you just take your pricing comment and total you're right, we had said we would not take pricing in the height of a pandemic and I still believe that was the right call as we got through the height of it. But as we look forward and as we see the pressure from the cost environment and we see pressure on gross margin, we're going to look to the broad toolbox that we have against our long-term goal of growing EBIT margin. And that toolbox includes things like on the revenue side, managing promotions and ensuring that we can add value through innovation and premiumization, but we will also consider pricing as part of that. And as we look forward, we will see what the right mix is by brands. And we feel given the fact that our portfolio has very high consumer value, the highest we have on record that we're in a position if we need to take pricing to do just that. Nik Modi : Super helpful. Thank you, Linda. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Nik. Operator : Next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Chris Carey : Hi. So just one question on the wipes business. So right, like you've lost about 1,200 basis points of market share there since, over the past year and all of that has effectively come from Lysol and other manufacturers who have seen big increases in market share. And I guess the question is you've obviously been underperforming a category that has delivered really significant growth and shelf is now occupied by a litany of other brands. And so, how sticky do you think that shelf space is in wipes from those new entrance? Maybe said another way, do you think you can get back this share that you've lost in the business, because if so, if you have manufacturing capacity coming online, that would imply that you might, but maybe \u2013 maybe these shelf gains from other competitors are going to last indefinitely? So I wonder if you could just comment on that. Linda Rendle : Sure, Chris. Wipes is obviously a very important and strategic business for us. One category that we created 20 years ago and we'll continue to be aggressive as we think about expanding this business and helping to serve consumers. I think maybe it'd be good to take a broader view of wipes because we're looking at a narrow universe of track channels, but if you look more broadly, the share loss that you're seeing in track channels is not reflective of the fact that we've prioritized our healthcare business to ensure that we have the right supply there. And that our professional business has always had a strong wipes business as well as untracked channels that are very strong. So the broader perspective to be clear; we don't like to lose share anywhere \u2013 anywhere and our goal is to always be growing it over the long-term. But the broader perspective with wipes business is in better shape than you might see in track data. But then even if you look at track data, the only people growing share right now are non-branded or new entrant competitors that are very small. There is no major manufacturer as we all try to ramp up the support. And I think what's going to happen is we're already seeing retailers think about simplification as we move forward, and there's going to be no desire on their part to add 10, 12 whatever a brand sit on the shelf right now that are filling the need. They're going to want to make sure that they're with leading brands, who are innovating and we know that we'll be with Clorox. We feel great about the innovation pipeline we have on the business. We feel great about the fact that our supply is ramping up and we're getting to the place where we'll have double the supply by the end of the year. So I think you're going to start to see as we bring supply back on, share will go in the other direction. Similar to how I highlighted in other businesses, Clorox clean-up eight share points once we brought that back on from a supply perspective; Pine-Sol up 2.5 share points. So this is very much correlated to supply. We think the long-term trends are behind us. And I think the most important part is we have not let up on the innovation and investments, so that as we bring that supply up, we'll be in a terrific place to get back to growing share. Chris Carey : Okay. Thanks. That's very helpful. And then just one follow-up, maybe for Kevin, just on phasing for gross margins in the back half [indiscernible] that manufacturing and logistics impacted gross margin really ramped up in the June quarter last year. It would imply that you're going to start lapping that in the June quarter of this year. But obviously we've seen manufacturing and logistics inflation accelerate in recent months. So do you expect that to remain as significant an impact as we get through the entire year or is there any phasing that we should be keeping in mind there? Thanks so much. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, Chris. As it relates to phasing, as we've updated our expectations for gross margin, as you heard, we now think we're going to be down slightly. One of the biggest changes we're seeing as our expectations for commodities, and we've talked about it, we're clearly an inflationary cycle. If you go back to November, we'd anticipated about 100 basis points of cost headwinds throughout the back half of this fiscal year. We've updated that expectation now where they're going to be closer to 150 basis points hit primarily driven by increasing costs of resin, and I expect that to be pretty consistent through the back half of the year. Chris Carey : Thank you. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. Operator : Next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning or good afternoon; sorry. I was curious a little bit about the international plans. And I was just hoping one to maybe get a little bit more specificity on countries, of course, maybe you can discuss countries you have not yet entered, but those where you've already started to invest in and establish the supply chain? And then secondly, I think just historically Clorox has kind of been, I guess maybe I can say in and out of quote international was sort of some changes and is going back over 20 plus years of making a go-forward in Brazil as an example, or debating, should we really go, try to do something in China or not. And the impediment has often been the question of how do you establish the Clorox brand to mean something with consumers that just may not be familiar with it; the way that it dominates here in the U.S. So can you just talk about how your perspective on that part of the question. Because the wipes form is something that others can do under different brand names in international markets. And so I'm just curious why \u2013 what you're going to do to really drive that Clorox brand in particular, to make this a more successful endeavor than it was kind of in the case in the past? Thanks. Linda Rendle : Sure. Thanks Lauren. In the case of international, we were pleased to see the strong volume driven organic sales growth, which was really broad based across the portfolio including cleaning and disinfecting Glad, Brita, Litter. And what was encouraging is the early contribution from our wipes expansion is about 20% of the growth we experienced in the quarter. So good early signals that it's working. If we think about the countries, we compete in over 100 countries around the world today, broadly with our portfolio. And the very first priority we have is to expand our presence in our cleaning and disinfecting portfolio in more of those countries. So to your good point, not having to introduce them to the brand in a brand new fashion, but actually just expanding the portfolio we have with those consumers to the offer them the benefit that a wipe brings them. And we've seen that successful so far and, early consumption looks good in those markets. And then, as we think about more broadly, the avenues that we have to introduce our brands to consumers have expanded. E-comm is now away that you can enter into a market, learn more about the consumer in a low cost way that allows us to get early insights and decide if we want to build more of an infrastructure behind in the international business to expand. So I think, what Lauren you're going to see from us is a very disciplined approach in this. We want to be fast, which is why we stood up dedicated supply chain, but we want to continue to be disciplined. And we want to see a strong return on the markets that we enter, and the very first proof points are the fact that we're entering markets. We are already in with an expanded portfolio. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. That's super helpful. And then I was also curious about A&P spend; your spending is already back towards historic levels. Obviously talking about increasing in the second half of the year further? As you look further out, Linda and arguably with competitive dynamics in your categories only getting more intense, right, is there's more attention being paid to them particularly core cleaning. How do you think about the right level of A&P be it in dollars or percentage of sales, kind of versus where you're targeted to spend in 2021? Does the competitive dynamics change with the elevated attention to the categories that you're anticipating not just now, but on the other side of the pandemic? Linda Rendle : Yes. I think on average over the long-term 10% to 11% is in the right ballpark. And what will vary of course, and you bring up a good point of competition is exactly what a quarter or a year looks like. Well, depend on the level of competitive activity. We see the amount of innovation we have. And as you know the 12% we plan to spend in the back half is really dedicated to the fact that we have a great innovation lineup. Two thirds of our innovation will be launched then. And we really see the opportunity to introduce consumers to that innovation to drive trial and then to benefit from the fact that we have very strong repeats right now \u2013 repeat rates right now across the portfolio. So we think about as you know A&SP as a strategic long-term investment. We're always looking at whether we think the right level is, but we are not hesitant to invest when we see strong returns and we're seeing that right now on the base business and strong returns as we start to spend behind innovation. So we'll continue to keep you updated, Lauren, if we have any change to that thinking, but very consistent with what we've said in the past. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : Next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Hi. Great, thanks. So as you start to lap the outsized growth of late last year next few quarters, can you talk a little bit of \u2013 just a little bit more nuances to how you expect your various segments to hold up relative to one another? I guess my question is, do you expect more resiliency in the Health and Wellness business just given lingering demand for disinfecting and it could conversely be far from the other segments, or do you think that performance will be more even across the entire portfolio? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. Hi, Steve. I can answer that one. And what I can share with you is our perspective on the back half. And Steve you'll recall back in November, our expectation was in the back half. We'd see our sales declined mid-single digits. With our updated outlook today, it implies our expectation that the back half will be flattish. And if I think about our portfolio in three buckets, I can kind of talk about how we see this playing out. If you think about our U.S. Cleaning business, which includes both our retail and our B2B business, we now think that this is going to continue to grow in the back half of this fiscal year in low single digits. Back in November, our expectation was it would be about flat and keep in mind we're lapping about 40% growth in the back half of last year, so a really strong prior period and we think that business will continue to grow for all the reasons we've been talking about today. On our International business, back in November, we thought that business would grow low single digits. We're now taking that expectation up. We now think we'll grow high single digits in the back half of the year. We're seeing really good results for some of the work we're doing on extending our wipes business. And that will continue to add value over the back half of the year. And then what we call our home essentials business, which is a little less than 50% of our total sales. We've updated our assumption there as well. Originally, we thought that business would decline high single digits. We now think it will grow or \u2013 excuse me, will decline mid single digits. And in all cases, those three segments, all grew double digits in the prior period. And so that \u2013 if you do that math, that gets us to about flat year-over-year in the back half. I'd say importantly though if you take a longer-term perspective and you look at our performance say versus fiscal year 2019, a pre-pandemic environment that would suggest we'll grow somewhere in the 15% to 20% range in the back half of this year. And so I think that the takeaway Steve I just \u2013 I'd offer is this is not just about increasing strength within our disinfecting portfolio. We're seeing performance broadly across our portfolio. We saw that in Q1 and Q2. And it's our expectation going forward what could you see broad strength across the portfolio. Steve Powers : Okay. Okay, thank you. I guess \u2013 and I don't know Linda or Kevin, if you maybe both want to weigh on this, but just as Linda you talked about pricing as a potential lever specifically \u2013 I think specifically on Glad, just given the rise in inflation that you've pointed out. In the past that's been a point of volatility for Clorox. You've gotten the pricing through, but it's often come with volatility in market share and volume as competitors respond or don't respond to various degrees. I guess can you just frame your relative confidence going into this inflationary cycle around how \u2013 just around your confidence taking that pricing and avoiding that volatility this time around. Thank you. Linda Rendle : Sure, Steve. If I think about what pricing does and how we approach this, it's really about managing over the mid to long-term. We don't want to take pricing over short term inflationary and we use trade bonds and we have for Glad in particular over a number of years to manage through those short-term impacts. But as we see a progressing cost environment coming up here, pricing is something we absolutely will consider across our portfolio where it makes sense. And, I think, it's safe to say pricing isn't something that is an easy thing to go execute. It takes a lot to do with excellence. And it comes with ensuring that we partner with retailers to have plans that grow their categories. And I feel like we are better positioned than we have been in a very long time on that. We have a terrific slate of innovation across our portfolio and particularly for Glad. We are spending against our brands, which retailers can appreciate in an incredible way right now because we're bringing people to the physical or digital shelf. And our portfolio is at the best place it's ever been from a consumer value measure perspective. So more people deem our portfolio, a percentage of our portfolio is superior than ever before. So I think with all of that, we're well positioned to do it. And what I wouldn't say is, I don't have a perfect crystal ball. Pricing is always something that we have to go out and we're dedicated to executing with excellence, but we would expect there are little bumps here and there, but we'll manage through them. And over the long-term we know that it's a good thing for us to do and it's right for the category. So again, no plans at this point on any of our brands, but we'll look at it as we head into the remainder of the year and next year as an option for us to expand margins. Steve Powers : Great. Thank you. If I could sneak in one more at the risk of being greedy just on Burt's, clearly there are challenges associated with the COVID backdrop on that business. I guess I'm just curious a little bit as to if this moment has changed at all, how you think about managing that business over time. Clearly, I'm sure you're investing, doubling down, tripling down on e-commerce and digital. But I'm thinking more about some like the portfolio of products that reside underneath the Burt's Bees brand umbrella as there's any shift in \u2013 into where within that Burt's portfolio you might be leading in and investing further versus maybe pulling back versus how you're thinking about going into the COVID situation? Thank you. Linda Rendle : Sure. And absolutely the environment has been bumpy for businesses in this space, and that's absolutely the case for Burt's Bees, but we have very strong conviction in the long-term portfolio as it stands today. And I think a couple of things jump out Steve and you've touched on a couple of them. The first is accelerating our progress in e-commerce and we have done that and leaned in over the last couple of quarters with very good results on the Burt's Bees business. The second is innovation and innovating in spaces where the consumer is particularly apt to be transitioning today as we're seeing that in skincare, we're seeing that in the healthcare space in general, and with that we have launched a new line of naturally clean hand products that helped to meet that need. And then obviously very strong conviction and continued conviction in our lip care business. We're still the market share leader in lip balm. And although we've had some weather issues that have impacted the overall category still feel really good about that business and our ability to innovate there. So overall, from a Burt's perspective, we'll continue to make tweaks as we learn from the consumer. But I think this is a brand where more than ever people are going to want things that they feel care for them and care for them using the power of nature. Steve Powers : Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hi, folks. Hope all is well, thank you very much for spotting me in, two questions. Kevin, this time last year, I know you were providing insight your 8-K breakout [indiscernible] bridges, so the headwind from higher trade spend. Can you give us what if any magnitude of tailwind you've had through the first and then the second quarter from lower trade spend? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. Jason, as it relates to trade spend particularly in Q2, if you look at our price mixes favorable three points in the second quarter, about half of that was favorable price, but half of that was favorable mix. On the price side, a little bit of pricing international, but the bulk of that was reduced trade spending because of the reduced promotional environment. So we've seen that pretty consistently for the front half of this year. Jason English : Would you expect that to turn the other way on the other side of this? So this time next year, would you expect that to be in a headwind? Or do you think the industry and you can settle out at a lower trade level than pre-COVID? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, I might separate my answer, Jason, in terms of the industry and what the impact will be for us. I do expect the industry will move back to a more normalized level of promotional spending as everyone gets more back in supply, I think that's to be expected. And then at the same issue for us our promotional spending is down specifically as a Clorox, not necessarily industry because many products we just can't promote right now because of the limited supply capacity we have. So I expect to see increased promotional spending for Clorox when we get back to promoting some of these products that we just haven't been able to promote for the last six months. Jason English : Yes, that makes sense. And I'm going to stretch on this. I'm not sure what you'd be able to answer and what you can't. But you referenced fiscal 2019 in looking at the back half of year and you said back half expect to grow 15% to 20% off of the same period of fiscal 2019. Clearly in the back half of this year, we're still deep in the midst of a pandemic. What would be, if at all \u2013 how if at all could you hazard a guess as to on the other side of the pandemic what that growth may look like off from fiscal 2019? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. That's thanks for asking the question, Jason, I'm sure you can appreciate, we're not ready to talk about plans beyond fiscal year 2021. We're in the process of developing those plans right now, but maybe just big picture what I leave you with to think about is our intent has accelerated the profitable growth rate of this company. As a result of the pandemic, we've talked \u2013 we have millions of new consumers coming into our franchise using our products. We're investing behind that. We have a number of new growth runways we've talked about both in out-of-home, as well as international expansion. And so we see these as long-term opportunities for the company that we're clearly investing in this year that we think generate long-term value. So again, we want to talk about our specific growth rates going forward, but we believe that sets us up nicely to be able to accelerate the long-term growth rate of the company. But in the near term there is going to be lots of noise as you compare quarters, pre- or post-pandemic. There's going to be a lot of noise for a number of quarters. I think when you get past all that, there's long-term opportunity for the company and we're investing behind that. Jason English : For sure. Lots of noise and lots of debate, thanks a lot. I will pass it on. Kevin Jacobsen : Thanks, Jason. Operator : Next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. A couple for me. I'll try to be brief here, because I know we're late in the call. The first one is going to be for Linda on pricing I wanted to revisit that. Second one for Kevin on capital deployment and share buyback. So, first one, Linda, just given the importance of pricing here, not just for Clorox, but of course more broadly for consumer staples with commodity inflation, so the willingness to take pricing I think is going to be well received and welcome given past commentary that the company was not going to do that during a pandemic. So I think that folks would generally agree that. That's certainly a good thing, but a couple of questions here. A, can you give us a sense of retailer's receptivity to price increases at this point, based on the current commodity environment and state of consumer? I mean, from a Clorox perspective, one could take the view that some of your categories have arguably never been more important to them than they are right now. And then secondarily, you touched on this, but I want to see if we can get a little bit more specific. How quickly can you put through the price increases? I guess what would be the hesitancy \u2013 excuse me, to doing that? Are you looking for more permanence in commodity costs inflation? Just to an earlier question, maybe a little bit of uncertainty in terms of what the competition is going to do. I guess what would be the hesitancy now based on what you're staring down, which is pretty significant commodity costs inflation to taking pricing? And then I have a follow-up for Kevin on buybacks. Thanks. Linda Rendle : Sure. Thanks, Kevin. Again, let's maybe step back and talk about pricing as a strategic lever and really what we're trying to do overall. And as you know, we're trying to expand our EBIT margins 25 to 50 basis points over the long run. And what we always look at is the broad set of tools that we have in our toolbox to manage cost wherever they may be. And one critical element of how we've done that over the short-term is cost savings, for example, and we had another robust savings this quarter and we expect to continue that. And I think as part of our IGNITE strategy, we put additional levers in place thinking about the role of technology and the role of sustainability could play and helping us do that over the long-term. So we're very much focused on managing as many of the short-term cost inflation increases that we see through those types of levers. What we're looking at right now is over the mid- to long-term based off of the outlook what role could pricing play. And that has to play a broader role in the category plans that we have. It's not something in isolation. So what we're focused on right now is strong innovation, strong brand investments, ensuring that we have the right assortment on shelves with retailers to match the fact that consumers\u2019 behaviors and needs have changed. And that is really the single highest priority we had in addition to supply over the last many months and continues to be over the next few months. So that would be why I would answer we're not ready to announce any type of pricing action at this moment because what we're focused on is serving consumers, what we're focused on is growing our categories, getting back to supply and we're focused on a terrific innovation agenda we have for the back half. And if we can do that with excellence, we will get to a place where as Kevin said, it's a very nice back half as you look back and take a broader view compared to fiscal year 2019. What gives us conviction though in the strategic \u2013 our strategic ability to take pricing again is the health of our brands, and the fact that we have been investing, the fact that we do have an innovation portfolio that strong, the fact that we have been partnering openly and transparently with retailers on how we get through the last 9 to 10 months together. So as we make those decisions, we feel confident in that overall suite of activity that we have that can help the categories. We'll continue to evaluate when the right time might be to do that. But for now we are really focused on investing in those brands, getting capacity back to 100% and innovation. Kevin Grundy : Got it. Thanks for the comments, Linda. Quickly, Kevin, just on capital deployment. As you know, company is carrying a higher than usual cash balance. The debt leverage looks pretty low relative to historically what you've carried about 1.2 times net debt-to-EBITDA, roughly, so understanding that you\u2019re, look, addressing some capacity needs for the business. But given the cash balance, given the pretty strong balance sheet, and the fact that, look, your socks off again today what was a pretty strong quarter. And the group is trading at relative lows versus the market that we haven't seen since the global financial crisis, really. And you have about $1.5 billion in board authorization. What would be the argument against leaning in a little bit more heavily on share repurchases at this point in time? And I'll pass it on. Thank you. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, thanks, Kevin. For us, as it relates to our capital deployment priorities, as you know, Kevin, no change in the priorities we've talked about for quite a while. Now we'll continue to prioritize investing in our base business and you folks see us doing it this year. Kevin, as you mentioned, we're increasing capital spending to increase our production capacity. We're also increasing investments in our brands in terms of advertising R&D and technology. So that'll continue to be job one. We'll also continue to pursue strategic M&A. We want to expand our portfolio, particularly in the health and wellness space. We have a number of areas we're interested in. So we'll continue to evaluate those and look for opportunities to do that. And as you mentioned, we have a very strong balance sheet right now, where we're carrying a little under $800 million on the balance sheet that is elevated. And so, as we've said, if we don't have a need for that cash, we will look for ways to get it back to our shareholders. If you think about this year, I expect over the balance of the year, we're going to return about a $1 billion to our shareholders, about half of that through our dividend, the other half through share repurchases, that's up pretty significantly. We were somewhere around $780 million or so we returned last year. So we've stepped it up this year. And then as we develop our plans for fiscal year 2022 and beyond, we'll continue to evaluate the best opportunities to invest that cash. And as I said, again, if we don't have a good use for it, we're not going to keep it on the balance sheet. We'll look for ways to get that back to folks. Kevin Grundy : Got it. Thank you both. I appreciate it. Good luck. Kevin Jacobsen : Thanks, Kevin. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : [Operator Instructions] I have a question from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Great, thanks. Most of my questions have been asked, but just one for you. It's just around your conversations with your retailers and just thinking about the categories that you participate in going forward, not necessarily just now or even 6 to 12 months from now, but how they're thinking about shelf space allocation, level of promotion necessary to drive the category in cleaning, and not only just in cleaning and disinfecting, but also your other big categories. And again, this is sort of thinking two to three years down the line with allocation to shelf space and how to think about running the categories post-pandemic. Thanks. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Olivia. You're hitting on exactly what we're talking to retailers about right now and we're partnering with them on is what is the long-term for these categories as we get through what's been an incredibly unprecedented, I think we can never underestimate or overuse that word unprecedented. And we're really turning to what does the future look like. What will the habits and behaviors that have started today that we believe will be very sticky in the future mean for the assortment that's needed, for the type of promotion that's needed for the shelf space. And what I would say is that varies depending on the category. And our categories have always been different at shelf, what's required from an assortment perspective, how much is merchandise et cetera. So we\u2019re working with them on those individual plans. We're bringing them consumer insights and what we're seeing in the changing behaviors. So for example, the fact that people are cleaning and disinfecting more, and we expect that to continue. They're cleaning different surfaces. They're thinking about the fact that when they leave the house, they're thinking about those surfaces around them in a different way, and we're helping them to plan for that. And then I think really importantly, what we've talked to them about is the innovation needed in order to address those needs and how we ensure we introduce that innovation in a quick manner that we get it on the physical or digital shelf and that we get the right trial behind that. And retailers are really receptive to hearing that right now. And in fact, are loving the fact that we're coming with so much innovation despite all of the craziness over the last nine months. So without getting into specific category details, that's exactly what we're doing. And retailers will begin to make those first moves as supply gets to the place where we're able to fully meet it and you'll start to see what it looks like online. I think a couple of themes, the first is simplification. We've taken the opportunity to simplify our portfolio, to help us run faster and many of our businesses, and that's panned out really well for us. I'm actually really well for retailers and so they're going to continue to drive simplification. We win in that environment being a number one and number two share brands. And then the second thing is omnichannel, making sure that a consumer has access to the right products depending on where they are and where they're shopping. And we're focused on that with retailers and ensuring that they have all of those right levers in place depending on where consumers are entering into their store. Olivia Tong : Great, thank you. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Olivia. Operator : And this concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle, I would now like to turn the program back over to you. Linda Rendle : Thank you, everyone. I'm happy with our first half results and look forward to strong execution of our plans in the back half. We'll speak again on our next call in May. Please stay well.

To help cut through some of the complexities this quarter, I'd like to share what we see as three important key takeaways. First, we're on track for another strong year. Our FY 2021 outlook continues to project double-digit sales growth. On a two-year stack basis we're also positioned to deliver about 19% sales growth. Second, we continue to see opportunity to accelerate our long-term financial performance. For example, many consumer behaviors that have changed during the pandemic are expected to stick including enhanced hygiene practices. We're leaning into these changes through new growth runways to help Clorox develop into a global disinfecting brand. And third, the pandemic has only reinforced the relevance of our IGNITE strategy priorities which center around people and innovation leveraging technology as a critical enabler. Now, turning to our third quarter results. Our strategy has enabled us to deliver flat sales in Q3 on top of 15% growth in the year ago quarter. Q3 sales reflected about one point of net benefit from July 2020 acquisition that gave us a majority share in our joint venture in Saudi Arabia. On an organic basis sales were down 1%. In our Health and Wellness segment, sales were down 8% reflecting declines in Cleaning and PPD. Sales in Cleaning business declined this quarter from lower shipments in a number of our cleaning and disinfecting products. The lower shipments are a result of demand normalization in bleach and Pine-Sol relative to the year ago period when consumers turned to these products given the persistent out of stocks in wipes and sprays at the onset of the pandemic. Segment results also reflect ongoing supply constraints in our wipes and sprays. Nonetheless, two-year stack growth remains very strong, reflecting a much higher level of consumer demand and household penetration than pre-pandemic, even as we begin to see a return to new normal in the US with a growing percentage of the population vaccinated. As we continue to increase supply in our wipes and sprays, product availability and assortment will improve, which in turn should lead to improvements in shares. We're also excited to be bringing back some of the innovation we've had to pause during the pandemic, including Clorox compostable wipes and Clorox Scentiva disinfecting sprays and wipes. Sales in our Professional Products business were down by double-digits this quarter, due to lower shipments of cleaning and disinfecting products as many businesses remain close during the third quarter relative to the year-ago period. Similar to the trends in cleaning, demand for our consumer-preferred disinfectants, like wipes and sprays remain elevated and consumption continues to be limited by our ability to supply. And as expected, consumption of bleach and other cleaning and disinfecting products has normalized. With continuing category tailwinds, progress in our out-of-home partnerships and a strong innovation pipeline, PPD fundamentals remain healthy. Importantly, we feel good about the prospects of this business. Lastly, within this segment, sales in our vitamins, minerals and supplements business were up in the third quarter, driven by higher shipments of our strategic brands and lower trade spending. Notably, we were lapping a double-digit decrease from the year-ago period, driven by a disruption in our supply chain-related to COVID-19. As noted in today's press release, we recorded $267 million net non-cash impairment charge related to this business, which Kevin will address in more detail shortly. Despite the setback, we're moving forward focused on implementing a refreshed portfolio strategy and incorporating what we've learned since acquiring these brands. There continue to be strong tailwinds in the VMS space. And we have clarity on the path of this business becoming a more meaningful contributor in the long-term. Again, just some brief context before I get into the results in our other businesses. Similar to cleaning, inventory levels in the year-ago period impacted Q3 results, especially in Brita, where we remain supply constrained. With continued elevated demand and supply challenges, several of our businesses in these segments have gone back on allocation. In Household and Lifestyle, consumers continuing to stay at home as well as business closures impact our businesses differently, benefiting some and challenging others. Nonetheless, our two-year stack growth across our segments remain very strong and well above our long-term sales growth targets. Turning to the Household segment. Quarterly sales were up 6% with growth recorded in all three businesses for a fourth consecutive quarter. Grilling sales were up by double-digits in what was a record-setting quarter of shipments for the business. Through strategic collaborations with our retail partners, we've been able to continue to grow household penetration and share. In the past year, we've introduced Kingsford products - Kingsford's products to more than one million new households. And they've invested in their backyard, including buying new charcoal and pellet growth, which will create a lasting tailwind for this business. Our pricing strategy has also led to a less promotional environment, which will reduce pantry loading going forward. And we've improved our product lineup and distribution, making it easier for consumers to find our Kingsford pellet innovation and new flavors of our Kingsford product lineup at even more locations nationwide. All these goodness is helping us build a healthy momentum for this business, which is especially important, as we head into peak \u2013 the peak of the grilling season and tough comparable periods. Cat Litter sales increased this quarter, despite lapping consumer stockpiling in the year-ago period. The driving forces behind the business strong performance have been its success in the e-commerce channel and innovation. Fresh Step with Gain continues to do well and build distribution with more innovation planned for Q4. Additionally, the record number of pet adoptions that has occurred during the past year will resonate for years to come as cat parents continue to purchase necessities like litter long after the pandemic has ended. Glad sales increased in Q3, mainly behind lower trade promotion. As a reminder, while we began to see elevated demand at the tail end of the year-ago quarter, heavy consumption didn't occur until late in FY 2020. So Q4 will be a more challenging comparison than Q3. In recent months, we've also seen a significant resin price inflation. To manage those rising costs, we have announced a pricing action on this brand effective in July. As we've mentioned, we'll manage inflationary pressures holistically using all the tools in our toolbox. This approach will allow us to continue introducing innovation that resonates with consumers, which has driven profitable growth for the category for a long time. For example, over the past decade, we've started using higher-quality resin that has allowed us to reduce overall use by 20%, resulting in a stronger bag with a reduced environmental footprint, all while improving our cost structure over time. Our latest innovation Glad ForceFlex with Clorox trash bags has been performing well since its fall 2020 launch. In Lifestyle segment, Q3 sales were flat. The Food business had a double-digit sales increase for a fourth straight quarter behind continued consumption growth of our Hidden Valley Ranch bottle dressings and dry seasonings. This growth was on top of high single-digit growth in the year-ago period. The ongoing trend of at-home meals has driven household penetration to another record high. Our optimism for this business is further fueled by the success of our latest innovation Hidden Valley Secret Sauces and Hidden Valley plant right-based ranch dressing, which has both \u2013 have both been performing well. Brita sales in Q3 were down by double-digits, as the category consumption decelerated from its COVID-related buying spikes in the year-ago period. Despite these results, consumption level has remained much higher than pre-pandemic, partly fueled by strong filter replacement. As with wipes and sprays, our supply chains have not caught up with demand in Brita, particularly for filters and impacting our shares and sales. On a positive note, we're continuing to make progress in addressing these supply issues, which has already helped us begin to recover share. Burt\u2019s Bees sales also decreased by double digits, due to the changes in shopping and usage behavior, that have occurred during the pandemic. The business was also lapping the effect of pantry loading in the year-ago period. Mask wearing and decreased mobility have created headwinds in both the lip care and face care segments. Still, the brand has not only maintained, but fortified its position as the number one lip balm. As we prepare this business for improving consumer mobility and consumers returning to cosmetics and colors, we'll be launching towelette innovation in value sizes and the new watermelon scent. These bright spots, combined with the continued growth in online channels, contribute to our confidence in the long-term growth prospects of this business. Lastly, International has its own unique dynamics that sets us apart from our other segments. Unlike the US, most international markets where we operate don't yet have high vaccination rates. As a result, demand for cleaning and disinfecting product, remain elevated. The two-year stack growth rate for this business is about 22%. In our International segment, Q3 sales grew 9%. These results which reflect the combined impact of about seven points of benefit from the Saudi JV acquisition and about two points from foreign currency headwinds are on top of 11% growth in the year-ago period. Excluding the impact of Saudi acquisition, half of all sales growth was driven by the introduction of a new line of Clorox disinfecting wipes, mainly flat packs innovation sourced from our dedicated international supply chain and launched in more than 30 countries this fiscal year. With strong innovation like this and differentiation of our brands in their respective categories, we feel good about the growth runway of this business. Now, I'll turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss our Q3 performance, as well as our updated outlook for FY 2021. Kevin Jacobsen : Thank you, Lisah, and thank you everyone for joining us today. We hope you and your families are well. Before I review our third quarter results, let me first address the non-cash impairment charge we reported today. The Better Health, Vitamins Minerals and Supplements business, represents about 4% of total company sales, comprising several small brands, we acquired in two separate transactions. Performance on this business has not delivered on our expectations. The impairment was a result of our updated valuation, which assumes lower sales and profit projections versus our initial expectations at the time of the acquisition, primarily driven by an increased level of competitive activity and the need for more investments to scale these small brands. As a result of our updated valuation, we record a pretax non-cash impairment charge of $329 to lower the carrying values of goodwill, trademarks and other assets of the Vitamin, Mineral and Supplement business unit. Net of a deferred tax benefit of $62 million associated with this impairment, we recorded a $267 million charge to net income or $2.11 per share. This represents about 27% of its initial purchase price. Going forward, we are implementing our refreshed portfolio strategy. We continue to believe in the attractiveness of the VMS space, driven by strong consumer tailwinds and the strategic fit, given our focus on health and wellness. Importantly, we fully expect that our VMS business will be a meaningful contributor to our company results over time. To ensure clarity around the underlying operating performance of our overall business, my comments on the third quarter results will exclude the impact of this non-cash impairment. In addition, my comments will exclude the impact of a onetime non-cash gain related to our Saudi joint venture acquisition. It's important to note, that while the Saudi joint venture is expected to contribute $0.45 to $0.50 to our reported EPS, it includes a $0.60 non-cash gain that we're excluding from our adjusted EPS outlook. Moving forward, in our fiscal year adjusted EPS 2021 outlook, we are continuing to include $0.10 to $0.15 charge, primarily from an ongoing intangible amortization related to the acquisition. Before I review our third quarter results, I'll comment briefly on our fiscal year outlook. As you saw in our press release, we've confirmed our fiscal year sales outlook and provided an adjusted EPS outlook, which excludes a non-cash impact from the VMS impairment in the third quarter, as well as a one-time non-cash gain of the Saudi joint venture acquisition in the first quarter. For perspective, excluding these items, help provide clarity around our underlying operational performance, which is unchanged from our previous outlook. Importantly I'm pleased we're on track to deliver another strong year for our shareholders, targeting a two-year stack of about 19% sales growth, well above our historical financial performance. Now, turning to our third quarter results. Third quarter sales were flat, in comparison to 15% growth in the year-ago quarter, when we saw the initial spike from COVID-19. Our sales results reflect a 5-point decline in organic volume, offset by 4 points of favorable price/mix and 1 point benefit from our Saudi joint venture acquisition. On an organic basis, third quarter sales declined 1%. Our sales results came in largely as expected, although there's certainly variability across our portfolio, which reflects a very dynamic environment we continue to navigate. Importantly, we grew sales in six out of our 10 businesses. Gross margin for the quarter decreased 320 basis points to 43.5%, compared to 46.7% for the year-ago quarter. Gross margin results reflect a pronounced inflationary environment, resulting in 360 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, including temporary COVID-19 spending, as well as 170 basis points of higher commodity costs, primarily related to the rising cost of resin, partially impacted by the extreme weather events we experienced in the Southern US earlier this quarter. Gross margin also reflects 100 basis points of negative impact from lower volume in the quarter. These factors are partially offset by 140 basis points of favorable trade promotion and 110 basis points of cost savings. Selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, came in at 13.3%, compared to 15.1% in the year-ago quarter reflecting lower incentive compensation expenses, primarily related to the non-cash impairment on the VMS business. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels, as a percentage of sales, came in at 11%, reflecting continued strong investments across our portfolio, with U.S. spending at about 12% of sales, to support a robust innovation program in the back half of the fiscal year. Our third quarter effective tax rate was negative 1.4%, driven by the impairment charge we took on our VMS business. Excluding the impairment charge, our third quarter tax rate was 23%, compared to 19% in the year-ago quarter, as we lap excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation. Net of all these factors, adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter came in at $1.62 versus $1.89 in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 14%. As you also saw in our press release, year-to-date net cash provided by operations was $893 million versus $806 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 11%. Our strong cash flow was due to profitable sales growth, partially offset by higher tax payments and higher employee incentive compensation payments. Turning to our updated fiscal year outlook. We continue to anticipate fiscal year sales to grow between 10% to 13%, reflecting the strength of our first half results and our ongoing assumptions for moderating demand over the balance of the fiscal year as we move beyond the peak of the pandemic in the US and lap exceptional prior year comparisons.  Our assumptions for one point of contribution from our Saudi joint venture offset by one point of foreign exchange headwinds remain the same. On an organic sales basis, our outlook continues to assume 10% to 13% growth. We now expect fiscal year gross margin to be down due to a more pronounced headwinds from elevated commodity and transportation costs. We now expect fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to come in below 14% of sales reflecting lower incentive compensation costs primarily due to our third quarter non-cash impairment on our VMS business.  Additionally, we continue to anticipate fiscal year advertising spending to be about 11% of sales, reflecting our ongoing assumption to spend about 12% in the back half to support our innovation program. For perspective, this fiscal year, we're planning to spend about $125 million more versus a year ago to ensure we're leaning into engaging consumers to build lifetime loyalty to our brands.  We continue to expect our fiscal year tax rate on a reported and adjusted basis to be between 21% and 22%. Net of these factors, we anticipate fiscal year adjusted EPS to be between $7.45 and $7.65 or 1% to 4% growth, reflecting the continued assumptions I mentioned last quarter, including strong top line performance partially offset by an increasingly elevated cost environment. In closing, I'd like to note that as we transition from the peak of the pandemic in the US, we're navigating a highly dynamic operating environment with the following factors that can influence our results in the near to medium-term. First, category dynamics and consumption trends. As more people get vaccinated and become increasingly mobile in the US, although we recognize different markets are in varying stages of pandemic, we're keeping an eye on short-term changes in these trends as they could cause variability in our top line.  That said longer-term, we believe our portfolio will continue to play a meaningful role in addressing consumer megatrends that have accelerated over the last 12 months, which will contribute to higher demand for our products relative to demand levels prior to the pandemic.  Second, more pronounced cost headwinds, which we'll plan to navigate with all the tools in our toolkit including opportunities for pricing in key areas of our portfolio. And third, increased production capacity to support ongoing elevated demand. This remains a key priority for us as our teams continue to look for every opportunity to expand our production capacity, while recognizing the ongoing volatility this creates on our extended supply chain.  And finally, I'll reinforce that we're on track to deliver another strong year for our shareholders, while keeping our sights set on the long-term. As you saw in February, we raised our long-term annual sales target to 3% to 5%.  Based on the early success of our IGNITE strategy and our continued plans to lean in even further with strong investments behind our brands, people, technology, production capacity and of course, our new growth opportunities where we believe we have a right to win. These efforts are all in service of our broader ambition to accelerate profitable growth, to create long-term value for our shareholders.  And with that I'll turn it over to Linda. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Kevin. Hello, everyone and thank you for being with us today. I hope you are all well. A year ago around this time when the pandemic spiked in the US, we knew we were facing unchartered territory. And as I look back at how we've managed our business to support our consumers, retail partners and communities over the last 12 months what makes me proud is that we stayed true to three things.  We embraced our role as a health and wellness company, which helped us prioritize our actions, including ensuring the safety of our people and emphasizing our support for health care workers. We put people at the center taking care of our teammates around the world and staying the course in doing everything we could to serve public health and consumer needs. We were led by our values, with our commitment to do the right thing guiding our strategic choices and actions. Out of all of this, our purpose became clearer. We champion people to be well and thrive every single day. With this in mind, here's what's important for you to take away from today's call. First, our business is well positioned for the future. I'm grateful our consumers have rewarded our team's dedication to serving people and communities around the world. Our business is significantly larger than it was before the pandemic. People have turned to our trusted brands for support, during an incredibly tough year, and Clorox has the most trusted brands in many categories. We see this play out in strong household penetration across our portfolio, with our brands in 90% of US households. We continue to see strong repeat rates across our brands among core and new users versus last year. And as Lisah mentioned, we continue to focus on retaining this larger base of loyal consumers. And of course, this is showing up in our results, including flat sales in comparison to a very strong base in the year-ago quarter. For perspective, it's worth noting that we delivered a two-year stack of 15% total company sales growth in the third quarter. And as Kevin mentioned, we're on track to hit a two-year stack of about 19% sales growth for the fiscal year. My second message is that, we have strategic plans in place to address near-term priorities as we continue to navigate in a very dynamic environment. First, there's more work to be done on improving supply, especially after weather-related disruptions in the third quarter and higher-than-anticipated demand in certain parts of our portfolio. We're pulling every lever available to us to improve supply, including working with third-party supply sources as we continue to run flat out. I'm encouraged by our progress, but our overall supply chain remains a top priority focus for us. Next, we fully acknowledge that market shares for key brands are not where we want them to be. That said, share declines are primarily driven by recent supply challenges. And as we continue to improve supply capacity, we expect to recover market share. We feel good about seeing continued strong consumption and demand across our portfolio relative to pre-pandemic levels. And as Kevin discussed, we're facing stronger cost pressures from critical input costs and a tightening transportation market. One of the four key choices in our IGNITE strategy is to generate fuel to support growth and mitigate inflation. We're taking a holistic approach to address these cost pressures by leveraging a number of tools to support our margins, including margin accretive innovation, net revenue management, pricing through trade reduction, and less price increases and as always a relentless focus on cost savings. My last message is this. With conviction in our purpose and guided by a strategy that makes the most of our strength, we continue to have our sights set on our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth. In the past year, we learned that by putting people at the center our IGNITE strategy has helped us to do what we do best, serve people who count on our brands. And we continue to have an opportunity to serve even more people around the world. And as we think about our future, our strategy is proving to be particularly relevant as it leverages significant consumer megatrends that have accelerated because of the pandemic. The latest research still tells us that consumer routines and behaviors formed during the pandemic are expected to persist, including prioritizing health and hygiene, drinking more water, taking vitamins and supplements and spending more time online. What's more the role of home has changed. With many companies pursuing hybrid models for their workforce, we expect more cleaning, more meal occasions and more trash to be generated at home. Our portfolio continues to be in a unique position to play a meaningful role in people's lives and we have every intention of accelerating new growth opportunities to support these trends. Moving forward, we're leaning into our IGNITE strategy with innovation remaining core to our key areas of strength. That means; innovating in our products, especially, larger stickier innovation platforms that deliver superior consumer value and multiyear growth for our business; innovating in consumer and shopper engagement; personalizing experiences for consumers so that we get to know 100 million people by the year 2025; and partnering with our retailers on category vision and leadership to support healthy and profitable categories. The turnaround of our Kingsford business is a great example of how our focus on innovation is contributing significantly to strong category and brand growth. Innovating how we work across the organization through technology that makes us smarter, work faster and in the case of our supply chain enables us to respond more quickly to future demand spikes. And finally, innovating through an ESG lens because we believe in the strategic link between our societal impact and long-term value creation. Here are some highlights in the last quarter. We're 21% of the way toward our goal to reduce virgin plastic and fiber packaging by 50% by 2030. We've achieved 76% of our 100% goal for recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging by 2025. We're introducing a company-wide learning and development program focused on sustainability because ESG integration in our business not only means embedding it in every brand, but also rallying every person behind our efforts. And with ESG embedded into our operations, our brands are not only contributing to our corporate ESG goals, but they're also pursuing meaningful goals that matter to their consumers. As an example by 2030, Brita has a goal to provide clean water access to 0.5 million people in the US facing poor-quality tap water. This speaks to the heart of Brita's brand purpose. Before I open it up for questions, I'd like to echo the important takeaways Lisah mentioned at the beginning of the call. First, we're on track for another strong year. Second, we'll seize the opportunity before us to accelerate long-term profitable growth. Third, our IGNITE strategy has proven its relevance in the face of the pandemic by putting people at the center, emphasizing innovation and leveraging technology to lay the groundwork for the future. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hi, guys. Kevin Jacobsen : Hi, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : Two things for me. First, one just can you clarify the 3% to 5% long-term top-line growth range from down in CAGNY, can you just clarify specifically what time period is that over? Is that a post fiscal 2022 range? Does it include fiscal 2021-2022? Just trying to understand that? And then second there are a lot of sort of puts and takes as we think about the next few quarters here from a top-line standpoint. In theory more difficult comparisons, COVID cases are dropping off. Vaccine counts are going up. Those are some headwinds, but you mentioned some of the supply chain challenges that you're working on. And you've talked about the greater opportunity in professional and international longer-term, which drove that higher long-term top line growth guidance down at CAGNY. So I was just hoping you could give us a bit of context as you look out here over the next few quarters in terms of some of those headwinds versus tailwinds. Could the business potentially decelerate with the comparisons you're facing, or do some of those positive areas more than offset it as you think about the business over the next few quarters here? I know you're not going to give a specific number, but just trying to think how you guys think through that particularly with some of those longer-term positive top line tailwinds you're thinking of? Does that play out in the near-term, or how long does that take to play out? Thanks. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure Dara. And let me start with your first question, or as you mentioned we raised our long-term sales goal of 3% to 5% back in February. In terms of the timing that's part of our IGNITE strategy, which runs through 2025. And Dara how I see that playing out as we talked back in February and we have the same point of view, we expect our sales to be roughly flat in the back half of the year. And that's consistent with Q3. And as we get into fiscal year 2022, our expectation is we're going to be by the back half of the year back to our long-term raised sales outlook at 3% to 5%. So as you know, we've got some tough comps here for the next three quarters. But as we get through those comps by January, we were at this new elevated level. And that's really as we work through the next phase of this pandemic as we see higher vaccination rates, more mobility, we fully expect that we'll see a slowdown in demand for products that's expected. When we get to that new normalized level, we think we're back at this 3% to 5% rate going forward. Dara Mohsenian : Great. That's helpful. And then any context around some of those headwinds and tailwinds and particularly supply chain challenges? Any progress on that front, how much impact could that have from a top line perspective as you think over the next few quarters here? Linda Rendle : Sure. I'll take that one. I'll start maybe with the big picture on what we're seeing as definitely tailwinds for us and we mentioned some of this in the script but with a little bit more color. We're definitely seeing consumer behavior trend sticky as we look over the mid to long-term. We're seeing hygiene continue to be that cornerstone of health for folks. And even as people are getting vaccinated and mobility is starting to increase, we're seeing people embrace those new cleaning behaviors as new routines. And they're both doing that inside and out of the home. In the business case, we're still seeing the need for higher disinfection as they welcome people back. But the issue has been depending on the market you're in and certainly we're seeing that in the U.S. mobility has not really increased the point where businesses are fully at capacity yet or even open in many cases. So we're seeing that both as a long-term headwind but as a short-term impact definitely to Q3. And we're looking to the future quarters to see how mobility will improve. I think the other things that we continue to see around people taking care of their health and wellness are persisting. We have a new installed base, for example, with Brita with a lot of people who purchased pitchers over the last period and we're seeing them continue with filter sales in their quest to be healthier and you take on good habits. Digital continues to persist and we think that will be a tailwind for our business as we've invested as you well-know more in digital marketing than the average in our industry leaning into that trend already. And then, of course, our strong position in e-com that we've built over many years and we continue to see that accelerate. And that's up to 14% of our business year-to-date. And then, the role of home continues to be a tailwind. And that was above our expectations in quarter three for sure. But we're seeing people persist, even as people have more mobility, people are eating more at home. And that what hasn't really changed at all, as people who were working from home during the pandemic are continuing to work from home. So we see that in our impact whether that be on our Kingsford business, on our Hidden Valley Ranch business or our trash business there's definitely positivity to that stay-at-home trend. So I think all of those are going to be tailwinds, as we look to the coming months and in the long-term. From a headwind perspective, supply chain has continued to be a challenge. And what we've done is gone after a tremendous amount of sales. We're a much bigger company than we were pre-pandemic. And that means that we have increased the complexity in our supply chain. We have a lot more nodes. We have a lot more third parties helping us. And then, what didn't help this quarter, of course were the weather disruptions that we experienced that caused quite a few force majeures in our products. And although we were managed -- able to manage through it, and deliver our overall commitment from a quarter three perspective, it's something we're watching really closely to see any volatility we have. But the supply chain being more expanded, continues to be something that we're watching, continues to be something that could be a help or a hinder as we look forward. Dara Mohsenian : Great. That's helpful. And if I can just sneak one more in, on the pricing front, obviously you mentioned the Glad increases, potentially opportunities in other areas. Can you talk a little bit about, if you have pricing plans in place across the rest of the portfolio? Is it still being decided? Is it just a matter of when you communicate it? How do you think about pricing, in the rest of the portfolio beyond Glad? Thanks. Linda Rendle : Absolutely, so as Kevin highlighted and Lisah highlighted in their scripts, absolutely seeing the inflationary pressure, as I think the entire ecosystem is now across our industry and from a retailer perspective as well. And what we have our sights set on is how, do we get to that long-term EBIT margin goal we have of 25 basis points to 50 basis points, from an accretion perspective. And the way we approach it, is very holistic. We're looking across a robust toolbox to address this, things like margin accretive innovation. And we have a terrific innovation program, that started at the beginning of this year and is continuing as we launch incremental innovations in Q4, net revenue management, pricing and that will include both, list price increases and trade reductions. And then, of course, our relentless focus on cost savings. So we're employing that entire toolbox right now, across all of our businesses. And we're coming from a place of strength in this. Our brands are strong right now. We have never had a higher consumer value measure. Household penetration is strong. We're seeing strong repeats. So we're feeling confident in that. And we're evaluating our ability to take price across all businesses. But I'll tell you, we will be very surgical and targeted in this. We're going category-by-category because we're -- of course we're weighing the broader environment. And we want to be measured in that. But I -- the message I want you to hear is we're looking at it very broadly across our portfolio. And what we're really focused on is executing by category with excellence. Dara Mohsenian : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Chris Carey : Hi everyone. So I just want to follow-up on, on that line of commentary around pricing. And then, I have a second question. So just on the pricing front, maybe just help us understand, your pricing at Glad, last time that happened it was -- caused volatility on shelf. Now you have competitors that are moving ahead of you. Can you just talk to confidence that that won't happen again this time? And then related to the pricing you did mention that lower promotions I think are going to be a part of how you're getting some net pricing. I think that's what you said. But promos are already at a pretty low level. And so do you anticipate your promotional levels going below peers? And then I have a second question. But the general framework there is, just Glad pricing risk and just -- did I hear that right that you think promo can actually be a source of pricing basically implying that maybe you're not looking at list prices in the rest of the portfolio just yet until we get well into fiscal '22? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Linda Rendle : Thanks Chris. I'll start. So we have confidence in our brands and the strength right now and that is absolutely inclusive of Glad. And all of the investment that we put in, in terms of incremental advertising, what we put in from an innovation perspective and how consumers have turned to our brands during this time, continue to give us confidence in our ability to take pricing. I think what we're also seeing this time versus what we saw last time is a broader inflationary environment that really is pretty systemic throughout the industry and what everyone is experiencing. So as you mentioned, we've seen competitors move in categories like Glad. I think Glad in particular, I'll just highlight we have already come up with that price increase that's effective in July. But given the volatility and the increases we're seeing in the resin market, we are looking at will we take even additional pricing in Glad based on what we've seen. So again we want to be -- let the cost pressures guide us. We're doing this for the mid to long term but we're seeing extraordinary circumstances in resin right now that are helping us to go faster on Glad. What you should take away on the other brands is not that we are not looking at with price increases. We look at that -- first of all we do that annually as a company to understand our position. But right at this moment, we're looking at that. But what I want you to hear is the way that we do that across the brands needs to be holistic. So some will include those price increases, others will not. And what you'll hear us apply to every business is cost savings. You'll hear us think about how we can have margin accretive innovation across every business, but less price increases we'll be very targeted on, but again evaluating across our entire portfolio. And I think from an on-shelf and a retailer perspective, we're working on category growth plans with them. And we're lapping a very strong period of growth. And as you think about the lower promotion question, what we're trying to do is get to a more normalized state of promotion. And it's still although accelerated versus where it was in Q2, it's still well below pre-pandemic levels. And as we lap that growth there's little incentive to put a bunch of deep discounting out in the system and we're working on growth plans. So that's how we're thinking about the lower promotions in the context of the environment, is that we all have strong growth to lap. And of course, we want to make sure that consumers that we continue to lean into them and invest behind the tailwinds. And that could mean a lower promotional environment. So we're watching that closely and again it will depend on the category. But the overall sentiment would be, keeping it as rational as we can and using promotion for what it's intended for to drive trial and to get consumers to keep us curious. Chris Carey : Thank you for that. Maybe just to close the loop, I mean the last time there was a commodity cycle pricing accounted for several hundred basis points to gross margin. Can you just comment on whether that is a sort of a realistic framework to think about go forward? And then the second question is just, I think if there was one area which surprised certainly relative to our model this quarter was the decline in professional and certainly on a sequential basis. Like I appreciate the cyclicality of the business, but there's also this underlying -- we've heard about all these partnerships that you're signing. And I guess also international came in a little bit light just relative to what we've seen from a lot of other staples companies this quarter. And so maybe I think underlying the question is just the confidence that these two businesses can be contributors to your 3% to 5% longer term growth outlook. Just maybe any puts and takes that you saw this quarter which give you confidence that those businesses can be bigger growth drivers going forward? Thanks so much for all that. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. Hey Chris maybe I'll start and I'll turn it over to Linda as well. On your first question in regard to the impact of pricing, I'd tell you it's too early for us to start providing perspective. We're right in the middle right now of building our plans for fiscal year 2022. And as Linda said we're going to be looking at a number of different levers in terms of how we're going to work to offset the transportation and commodity cost increases we're seeing. Pricing will certainly be one of those levers but we'll be looking at a number of others as well. So, we'll update you on that one as we get further along with our plans in August. In regard to International just a perspective of International as you may have seen volume was down. I think it's worth noting we feel very good about the progress we're making on our cleaning and disinfecting work. And as Lisa mentioned in her prepared remarks, we continue to expand the number of countries we're introducing wipes into and we've added 30 countries now. Specifically, though in the third quarter, one of the challenges we had was in Canada. While we saw growth pretty broadly across our portfolio in Canada and if you're tracking that region, you may know they are now in their third lockdown. And in the Canadian market it's a little different than the US, in their lockdowns for items that are deemed non-essential. If you go into a retail outlet, in many cases, those aisles are blocked off where you can't shop them. And so as an example in third quarter we grew our cleaning and disinfecting business in Canada, but we saw pretty significant declines in other parts of our business. Our Brita business was down over 30%. Our Burt's Bees business is also down by a similar amount because consumers are not able to shop those aisles. Now, right now the lockdown they've announced goes through May 20th. So that has some knock-on effect as we move into our fourth quarter. But we expect as we get out of that lockdown, those businesses will rebound. But by and large, we feel very good about the progress on our cleaning and disinfecting portfolio internationally. And then Linda will talk a little bit about our professional business. Linda Rendle : Yes. I think professional is a unique part of our portfolio because it really is tied very heavily to mobility. And if you think about this, it has to really do with the comparison period. So, last quarter three, businesses hadn't shut down by the -- in that point even though we saw consumer takeaway in the retail side for the most part businesses were open. So, we had a very strong comparison period to lap. And in contrast to that this quarter most businesses continue to remain closed. And you have to recall too we have a very established business when it comes to professional. This is not just about the new opportunities, but we've been cleaning these businesses for years and years. It's about 7% of the company before this growing strongly mid-single to high single-digits and so that really had an impact. And I think if you look broader across the professional space, not just ours, they're seeing the same trends broadly in that industry. But if you take a step back the trends continue. The partners that we've had as we brought on in the new out-of-home space continue to see the benefits of offering their guests a clean and disinfected space branded by Clorox and we continue to expand those partnerships and bring new ones on. The two-year stack on this business is up 17% so very strong growth on top of strong growth for many years. And we continue to have conviction in the long term. The reality is consumers need that reassurance that spaces are clean. We know businesses want to provide that to them so they can get back to growing again. And we have a terrific new suite of innovation that we're excited about that's coming in quarter four including expanding our electrostatic sprayer business with both new forms and chemistries. So feel really good about the long term of this business. There's a lot of noise in the short term, as most of the professional spaces out there have encountered, but no change to our outlook for the future. Chris Carey : Okay. Well thanks. Thank you both for all that. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Yeah. Hi, everyone. So Linda, I was hoping you can address something on disinfecting wipes, just two vectors to think about on category growth. So I look at numerators vaccinated shopper data suggest that vaccinated consumers buy rate that disinfecting wipes is dropping faster than unvaccinated consumer. So I was just -- hope you can provide some complex and thoughts around that. And then secondly on market share given this has been a supply-related issue, I mean what's the case that you can make to retailers to get back the space at a point where you feel like the supply problem no longer exists? I mean, is it going to be about marketing support, brand loyalty or basket size place? So any thoughts around that would be helpful. Linda Rendle : Sure Nik. Just starting with disinfecting, we continue to see really strong behavior changes from consumers. But we did anticipate to experience as people became vaccinated behavior is changing. And we did see that curve move up slightly. So as people got vaccinated, it just happened a little earlier. And frankly, vaccines happened earlier than we had anticipated. So that's normal. We expected that as we go forward. But the key takeaway is versus prepandemic levels cleaning behaviors are still significantly elevated. And we continue to expect them to be into the future. And we're hearing that from consumers. We're seeing that in their buying habits and continue to feel confident about our ability to -- for these growth areas in cleaning and disinfecting to get us to our 3% to 5% growth rate moving forward. I think as it particularly comes to market share, just to be really clear, we are not happy. Whether it be supply related et cetera, we want to grow share. And that is our goal and we want to do that over the mid- to long term. This really does have -- it's primarily driven with supply, particularly in cleaning and disinfecting. Not only did we have the weather-related issues, but as we talked about the more that we expand our supply chain, the more nodes that it has, the more risk it introduces. And that really impacted our ability to lap a very, very strong period that of course included the depletion of all the inventory across the system last quarter three. As we look forward to supply though, we're optimistic. We've made good progress and we anticipate substantial improvement in the next four months. And we plan to be in stock on most businesses in cleaning including wipes by the end of Q1. And what consumers are already experiencing is better than what they've experienced for the months premium to that. They're going to the shelf and they're finding something from Clorox which is good to see. And then we anticipate being fully in stock across our Cleaning business by the end of Q2. So that includes some things like sprays and some of the other items that are still supply constrained. When it comes to market share moving forward, supply is going to help, but the other thing is innovation. And we have a terrific suite of innovation in quarter four that retailers are really excited about. And that includes reintroducing things that we had to put on pause. Scentiva that was a large growth platform for us prior to the pandemic, we are starting to ship that again. Compostable wipes are also back in market again. And we know they had a strong start prior to the pandemic and we'd expect them to continue. And then, we're also going to be expanding our disinfecting floor mopping business that we had started right at the beginning of the pandemic. And we expect broad distribution on that. In addition, we're launching brand-new to the space innovations, including paper towel wipes, a brand-new Clorox non-bleach all-purpose cleaner, and then building off of our electrostatic business, that's already at over $100 million in sales and launching new forms and new chemistries kind of brand-new to the market. So, a great suite of innovation that we're working with retailers on and that's what we're focused on innovation and growing the category. And that's resonated really well. Nik Modi : That's very helpful. And if I could just -- just one real quick one on vitamins. You talked about you have plans in place. Can you be specific in terms of what exactly you plan to do to kind of turn around the fortunes of that business? Because it seems like the overarching kind of backdrop of that industry is going to look much better than it would have been pre-pandemic just given everyone's focus on self-health and self-care. So any specifics around the strategy would be helpful. Linda Rendle : Yes. Nik, why don't I give a little bit of background too? I think that would be helpful then to talk about what we're planning to do just as a backdrop. As Kevin mentioned in his remarks, we bought a bunch of small brands through two acquisitions, three to five years ago. These were small brands very strong in the then fast-growing natural channel. And we expected them to grow consistent with what we're seeing in that broader category, high-single-digits to low-double-digit growth, and of course, getting a shorter time to synergies. The underperformance is related to what we bought. So channel headwinds have been a big component of that. Natural went from plus 8% at the time we bought it to a headwind at negative 5%. And that's only accelerated given the pandemic and what we're seeing in retail consolidation. We're also very heavily weighted in probiotics and that category has been fragmented. It slowed down given the massive amount of people who've been launching probiotics in other forms, in food, et cetera, and then certainly higher competition as people have entered that attractive space. And then, just given the size of the brands that we bought, we realize it's going to take a longer time and more investment to get there. So, what do we do looking to the future? It starts with the fact that we have really good conviction in the strength of the category and the tailwinds that we see from a consumer perspective. Those remain very strong. People are continuing to do things to take care of their health and wellness, and vitamins and supplements are absolutely part of that. So with that, I'll give you what I can talk about in the strategy at a high level and we'll welcome talking about more detail coming up in the future. But what we're really focused on is first making sure that we have the right category knowledge and we feel great about that. We have a better understanding of how the category works and how we need to operate with those small brands in it. We've hired new industry talent that has a lot of experience in this space and they've helped us to get clear on that. And we've refreshed our strategy, and particularly around our portfolio and how we win with those brands moving forward. And so with that, and I know Nik you probably want more details on that, but we'll have more to share later. We fully expect to be able to get to company accretive, sales and profit over the long-term. But we've built in a slow ramp-up period as we think about that, because it's going to take some time to do what we plan to do on these brands and get to a place where they're delivering that type of accretive growth for us as a company. Nik Modi : Excellent. Thank you, Linda. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Nik. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Linda, on the Glad bag pricing comment, when should we see this flow through? I'm assuming that's fiscal 2022 consideration at this point. I'm curious because as you know it will mark about six months that your large competitor took pricing from what I understand. Is that the strategy now to recover some of that share? And any other categories that -- I appreciate that you don't want to come across as being opportunistic. And I know knowing from the benefit that you had from your strong brands and everything to come across as taking price in the middle of pandemic, but now that we are hopefully coming through high vaccination rates, so when do you think is the time to actually take some of the other categories that are also impacted by transportation cost pressures and commodities to be considered to be taking pricing? And one -- also before you can answer. But just so before the as far as I understood like you think that commentary about having the supply chain normalized and having the cleaning products by -- fully on shelf by the end of the calendar second quarter, would we expect also that international and professional the professional business will be normalized? So that's only the cleaning and you still have the work to do to recover share and capacity on these other segments? Thank you. Linda Rendle : Thanks. I'll take those in turn and we'll start with the Glad pricing question that you had. So we announced that price increase to the trade in March and it will be effective in July. And as I said previously, we are though looking at given the continued inflation that we're seeing with resin would we want to take an additional action on Glad. And that we're still contemplating and we don't have news to share on timing on that. But the round that we just announced will be effective in July and then it will pass through. And we'll see retailers change prices on shelf as they do that. As it relates to your broader comment on pricing that really is category specific and it has to do with the timing. These businesses have different seasonal aspects to them. They have different promotional plans. They have different innovation plans. And so I don't have any more to share on timing on any of those categories, but I just want you to take away that we are looking at it across every category. We -- but we will be doing this category-by-category and it really has to do with those dynamics that we're experiencing, and of course, the broader plan. And I also want you to take away what we are absolutely doing on every category right now is cost savings and we're going back. We're pleased to be on track to deliver our cost savings target for the year. And we're looking at what other places could we plus that up across all of our businesses. And then of course, innovation is the same. But as we have more news on pricing we'll share it. But at this point it's Glad and news that we're looking at would there be additional action we'd want to take on Glad given what we're seeing in resin. And then as your question on supply chain, professional has some shared supply chain as does a small portion of international with our US retail cleaning business, but they also have components that are completely separate. But they are largely expected to recover on the same timing that we have from retail. Although, international I would say at this point particularly with wipes given we have a dedicated supply chain, we're not at a point that we're constrained in the vast majority of our International businesses because of that dedicated supply chain. Andrea Teixeira : And any anticipation of like accelerating the growth into other countries? I think you mentioned I think Lisah mentioned 30 countries already. Is there any ramp up or additional places, or you'd say, right now I got the wipes which is obviously the low-hanging fruit. Now I'm going to offer them sprays or other things that may actually accelerate the international growth? Linda Rendle : Yes. As we spoke about at CAGNY against our goal to accelerate long-term profitable growth, and get to that 3% to 5% sales range, we anticipate stronger growth from international. And that really is behind building a global Clorox cleaning brand, which we had to start to, but we think we can help serve more consumers around the world. And the idea would be, of course, wipes is an important part of that portfolio, but really looking broadly across the set of cleaning products that we have, strengthening our innovation across the Clorox brand. And that can include things like sprays, like you mentioned that we would be able to do that. So that's exactly what we're looking at as we enter markets, what's the right product lineup and where can we leverage innovation to expand our presence in those markets behind the Clorox brand. Andrea Teixeira : Very useful. Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Good morning for you guys, I suppose. A question on elasticity, obviously, there's a lot of inflation and pricing is coming through across the board. I know there's a \u2013 you've got quite a strong view and the consumer research suggests an intent for pretty structural changes of use of products in the home and at the home. To what degree, are you worried about the risk of breaking that trend, or do you feel like you have to be careful about maybe there's an opportunity that can be lost if too much pricing is taken? From a cost perspective, it makes perfect sense to take pricing to cover it. But what are you thinking about from an elasticity perspective and how that may change things? Linda Rendle : I'll start. When we look at the strength of our brands, we always focus on consumer value as the measure, we look at to determine the strength of our brands and our ability to take pricing, because of course consumer value is composed of the strength of the brand that we have. It's comprised of the product and how people experience that versus competitive products. And of course, pricing is a function of that as well. And we're looking at that triangle that that forms to say, what is the right mix by category by sub-segment to deliver that right value for consumers and we're always trying to optimize that. So we take that into account as we think about it. Given the fact that, we have higher consumer value than we've ever had since we began measuring it that implies, the strength of our brands that they have ability to take price. And as we strengthen our innovation program, as we've leaned in to spend 11% behind our brands this year, and keep them strong that was one of the questions we've got a lot of is, why would you invest during a time when people want your brands already? And it was about building that brand strength and equity over the long-term. So that we have ability to introduce them to new products, as they demand it, and of course take pricing as we need to. So we're taking that into account. I would say, regardless of pricing, these consumer behaviors are here to stay. Consumers have absolutely shown a willingness to pay during this time to keep themselves safe and well through, all of their behaviors whether that be cleaning, drinking more water et cetera. And also as they start to eat at home, we've seen lots of trends around consumers having meal experiences. They've invested in grills, and they've invested in that long-term behavior. So we feel really good about our ability to do both, which is continue to take advantage of the trends that we're seeing, but also price where it's appropriate to recover margin. Kaumil Gajrawala : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Hey guys. Thanks. A couple of questions for me. The first one is just, as we think about the Health and Wellness segment factoring in what you guys are seeing or envisioning as the new normal level of consumption coming out of the pandemic, as well as your improved ability to supply, I guess I'm just trying to gauge, what you think the kind of the average absolute run rate of sales in that segment is likely to be as the new base? You've obviously been running $800 million plus for the last several quarters. And then, this quarter came down below $700 million. And I'm trying to sense, do you think the -- do you think this is the new normal level of consumption? Does it bounce back and meet somewhere in the middle? Just how you're thinking about that as we go forward. Linda Rendle : Sure. I think, if you look -- if you -- maybe I'll take a step back and talk about what we're seeing overall and what we've seen in the past because, I think we're operating from a really strong base. I'm not sure, how clear this was in the past. If you take a step back and look at our retail cleaning business, prepandemic that was a place of strength for us. We were growing mid-single digits in both topline and bottom line in the retail cleaning business for a number of years. So if you look at the five-year CAGR prepandemic, that was mid-single digits. So we were starting from a place of strength. And we see that continuing as we move to the future and we see -- building off of that. So if that gives you an idea of what we're thinking about, it will be above the company average is what we're anticipating, given the fact that it's a place where consumer tailwinds are working, where we think innovation is going to play a really big role because consumer needs have changed. And then again, that investment and we've long been investing in the Clorox brand, but we've increased that during this pandemic. And we think it's going to be pretty solid from a behavior perspective, as we move forward as we combine all of those things. Steve Powers : Okay. Okay. I can work with that. I guess shifting gears to gross margin. I guess there are two things here. The depth of what I think your guidance implies for the fourth quarter is something like a 600 basis point -- 600-plus basis point contraction in the fourth quarter if my math is correct. You can correct me if it's not. I guess, what I'm -- what I -- coming that's question number one I guess of this. But the second part is just trying to gauge your sense of urgency of building that back. Obviously, you're taking pricing in Glad, looking at pricing elsewhere as you made clear. But are you -- do you would you be satisfied with kind of a more elongated Glad path of margin recovery, or is this something that you're eager to claw back as we think about the first half of '22? I'm just trying to A, size the level of contraction and then B, gauge your sense of urgency in getting it back. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, Steve, thanks for the question. Two things. On Q4, we don't provide quarterly guidance but what I can share with you is as we said for the full year we expect our gross margin to be down. For me that's likely about 100 bps on the full year basis. And as we mentioned back in February my expectation is it would be down to a lesser degree. As we've highlighted what's really changed for us is while transportation continues to be a challenging market for us. It's really resin that had the biggest impact really driven by the ice storm we saw back in February. When we talked back in February, during our previous earnings call, I had anticipated about 150 bps headwind from commodities in the back half of the year. I think that's going to be closer to 200 bps now in the back half. And you saw in Q3 in our attachments we provided about 170 bps in Q3. I think it will be higher in Q4. And I think it will probably peak in the front half of fiscal year '22 and then we'll start to see some softening. And so I think that's how it's going to play out this year in the near-term. And then your longer-term question on margin recovery, Linda just mentioned it. We are committed to growing EBIT margins 25 to 50 bps over the long-term. And so we're going to continue to aggressively work towards that goal. And as part of that is the actions we're talking about now as it relates to recovering these cost increases, pricing being one element of that, but we're going to be leaning into cost savings in many other areas as well. We'll work to recover margin. And then maybe last comment Steve that might be helpful. If I provide a broader perspective, if you think about our financial performance where we were before the pandemic at the end of fiscal year 2019 and where we're likely in this year on a two-year stack basis that's about a 100 bps increase in gross margin. And so we'll certainly be challenged this quarter and next quarter. If I take a long-term view we've improved the margins of the company about 100 bps over the last two years. And then as I said earlier, our goal is by the time we get to the back half of fiscal year 2022, we are delivering 3% to 5% sales growth. We're expanding margins. We're delivering earnings growth. So hopefully that gives you some perspective on our desire to quickly move through this challenging environment but make sure we're taking the necessary actions to put us on track for our long-term sales and profit goals in the back half of 2022. Steve Powers : No it does. I appreciate it. If I could squeeze in -- just to build on that. I don't think you specified exactly across the Glad portfolio, how impactful this announced price increase is? Is there any quantification you could offer on the actions that you have planned for July? That would be helpful. And then you did something different for Clorox and moving to an adjusted EPS quantification for fiscal 2021. I guess, there's like a -- it sounds like there's a $0.03 to $0.04 amortization charge that is in GAAP, that is not in your adjusted number. And I guess is the intention beyond fiscal 2021 to move to an adjusted, or should we think about as we think about sizing up your fiscal 2022 guidance moving back to GAAP and layering back in that $0.15 for the year? Thank you. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. Thanks Steve. On the two questions on Glad, I'd tell you think low to mid-single digits pricing action that will take effect in July. And as Linda said we'll evaluate if additional actions are necessary. And then on an adjusted EPS as you said, we introduced it for the first time this quarter. And, Steve, the intent is we really thought this would help as we provide both on a reported GAAP basis, but we also thought adjusted would help our investors as we've had two large noncash charges now. We have the gain in Q1 from our Saudi acquisition and we have the VMS impairment. And so we think giving that additional perspective is helpful. And particularly as you go into fiscal year 2022, continue to use adjusted allows you to have a better understanding of our operational performance as you're able to look past this one-time gain or one-time charge we have this year. So you should expect us to use that going forward. Steve Powers : Okay. Thank you so much. Kevin Jacobsen : Thanks Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : [Technical Difficulty] versus adjusted, because being a GAAP reporter arguably has been a point of pride for the company right and something that you could also argue contributed to the stock valuation over time. And I know that's a very, very high bar to hold yourselves to. But I'm really -- I mean I get that the impairment charge is this big one-off. But if I remember back in last year's fourth quarter when you introduced the guidance and including the JV gain, you specifically talked about it as being offset by tax and FX in the full year earnings growth. And now you're asking us to switch to adjusted just when we would be looking at fiscal 2022 growth rates. So I'm struggling with really being comfortable with that ask, particularly if you believe there's so much going on with the business. It's really positive and constructive that we shouldn't need to be kind of playing these games. So Kevin, I'd really just love further perspective on that decision. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. Lauren, I wouldn't agree with playing games that characterization. We think that's helpful additional perspective. So to be clear, we'll continue to provide a reported GAAP basis estimate and we will provide an adjusted estimate as well. And again, we think both numbers are helpful and insightful for investors. We have a very large gain in Q1 and a large charge in Q2. We want to make sure our investors can understand our operational performance.  To your point, Lauren, there's a lot going on operationally. We want to make sure we can help investors understand that as clearly as possible. So setting those two items aside, we think is another insight to our business. It will be helpful. So that's why we introduced it and why we'll continue to use it going forward in '22. So as we look at our '22 performance, you can evaluate that versus our 2021 performance excluding these two items and really understand I think more clearly on an operational basis our performance year-over-year. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Thanks. That is very helpful perspective and I appreciate that. And then I did just want to follow-up one more question on market shares. And I know that Nielsen is far from perfect particularly with your strong shares in club and the quick gains you've made in e-commerce over time. But Nielsen does measure something. And when we look at Nielsen, it looks like your share in spray cleaners and in wipes is not just down this year, but is down. If I looked back pre-pandemic that your shares were down pretty considerably, particularly in the spray cleaning category. So I just would like some further perspective there on whether or not there's been some channel prioritization dynamics, whether or not in hindsight there's a sense that maybe you could have invested more and been more proactive in cleaning historically? Because it feels to me like again just looking at the Nielsen and knowing it's imprecise there's a bit of a hole to dig out of on share that's not really related to during the pandemic supply constraints. Thanks. Linda Rendle : Hey, Lauren, I'll take that one. Thanks for the question and try to provide some clarity on this one because I know it's really complex. Maybe taking a step back would help on this one just to get clear on what we experienced in cleaning and what we think we drove pre-pandemic, what we're seeing now, which again we're not satisfied with. And then how we see this playing out over the coming months and years as we get to a more normalized state.  So first big picture, if we step back and look at our retail cleaning business, it's actually been a great area of strength for us. I mentioned a little earlier that, we had strong growth. So if you look at the five-year CAGR pre-pandemic, we grew that business mid-single digits both top and bottom line. And that corresponded to an overall share increase in home care of two points from fiscal year '13 through 2019. So that was something that we've been investing in. We had been really trying to expand the Clorox brand. We had a strong focus on innovation. We have launched Scentiva during that time. We had done improvements on a broad range of our portfolio. So it's been a nice area of strength for us.  I think as you dive into the individual segments, Lauren, you do get to what you said which is there are ups and downs. And sprays is an incredibly complex fragmented category. So while we were winning in a lot of the particular segments that we are strong in, it could be true that in other ones we weren't. And we have a very strong spray business to your point outside of track channels, which is about 50% of our business. So -- in aggregate. So we -- I feel like we walked into this pandemic in a strong way from a Clorox perspective. There's always work to be done in individual segments as you highlighted. But overall, we were winning in Home Care. And as we look to the future I think a lot of those elements are going to continue to resonate, but we're going to ramp them up. One, the strength of that Clorox brand. It's why we've invested so much this year behind that and increased the spending. We're on track to spend across the company another $125 million in advertising and sales promotion this year, why we've ramped up innovation. And I mentioned the innovations that are worth repeating; reintroducing Scentiva, compostable wipes are back on shelf; disinfecting floor mop costs, which is a brand-new incremental category for us to compete in; having new offerings in Clorox sprays that aren't bleach and that's a first for us as well as paper towel wipes and then broadly expanding against our new electrostatic business that we really created from nothing a number of years ago with some partnership. So I feel terrific about what we have in place to continue to meet consumer needs. I am not happy Lauren with where we are share-wise. None of us are, but we feel confident in our ability to get back into that share growth as supply continues, again which is the majority of the issue. But we're laser-focused on that consumer value metric innovation and investing behind the Clorox brand. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Linda, thanks. I really appreciate that. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Lauren. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Linda Rendle : Kevin? Kevin Grundy : A bit. But -- so for your outlook now specifically advertising and marketing still 11% of sales, including 12% in the back half of the year. I think as you guys are well aware both of those are historical highs as far as I have going back this is a decade. So on a full year basis on a six-month basis, was there any thought at all about pulling back as commodity costs move higher? I suspect the answer is not a lot given a lot of the discussion around market share, but maybe you can comment on that? And then just confidence on ROI behind the spend given a lot of the volatility that exists around consumption, et cetera. The context here understanding supply-chain constraints have been a problem and one that you're trying to address, but I'm sure the hope would be in principle that market share would be in a better place with advertising and marketing your historical levels. That's probably not going out of much of a limb. And then maybe just, sort of, tying this up longer term is 11% the right number? We don't have to go back very far. And it was 9% of sales. Is it possible this comes in it comes back to 9% which is not, sort of, permanently in the P&L. So maybe some comments there which I suspect you're not making that sort of decision in a vacuum. It's going to be where is market share and whether you're satisfied with it. But not to belabor this because I feel like we've spoken on a lot of it but anything you feel in that would be incremental, would be helpful? Thank you. Linda Rendle : Sure, Kevin. 11% for this year was something we had a lot of passion and conviction on given the fact that we're seeing so many people enter our brands. And we wanted to create that loyal consumer base moving forward. And we wanted to give them the right product information that they needed during such a trying time for everybody, but also give them new solutions as people had different challenges to solve. And innovation and advertising play a really important role in that. So for this year, we are on track to spend 11% as you highlighted and we have a strong spend coming up here in Q4. And that is behind the new innovations that we've launched. And I think you'll recall probably from previous conversations that our goal was to double the amount of advertising we spent on innovation this year to welcome people into those new product experiences and create loyalty and trial. As we look forward -- and let me comment on ROI, before I say we move forward. That's something that we're tracking real-time and getting information and insights on. And what I can say is the ROI continues to be very strong and that's why we continue to spend, and we're seeing it translate into results from a consumer-metric perspective. So continue to have incredibly high household penetration. We have household penetration gains across a number of our categories. We're seeing loyalty strengthen. So retention rates growing, repeat rates growing on both core users and new users. We're seeing consumers buying larger quantities more often. So all of the things that we would attribute to to long-term consumer metrics that show the health of the brand, the advertising drives, we're seeing that not only just the strong ROI but those metrics increase that are important to us to talk about loyalty. As we move forward, we don't have a prescribed number whether it be 10% 11%. But what I can say is we're committed to investing in our brands. And we'll continue to optimize what that right level of spending is depending on exactly like you highlighted market shares, depending on the innovation programs we have. But what you should hear from us is we will continue to invest in our brands. And we'll \u2013 as we update and give you a perspective for 2022 and beyond, we'll communicate what that exact number looks like. But you heard our continued commitment to advertising as a strong lever to help us get to our 3% to 5% over the long term. Kevin Grundy : Very good. Thanks and good luck. Linda Rendle : Thank you. Operator : And your final question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. And it appears his line disconnected. Linda Rendle : Jason one more time. He's not there at all, operator? No? Operator : His line disconnected. Linda Rendle : Okay. That's the final question? Operator : Yes. Linda Rendle : Very good. All right. Thanks again, everyone. We look forward to speaking to you again on our next call in August. Until then, please stay well. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Linda. Linda Rendle : Thank you, Lisa. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Fiscal 2021 was an extraordinary year for Clorox, with the pandemic putting us through the ultimate test of volatility, including rapid changes in consumer demand and significant cost inflation, which was reflected in our Q4 results. Despite the complexities we faced, we delivered 9% sales growth for the fiscal year on a reported and organic basis, reflecting growth in all 4 reportable segments. This was on top of the reported 8% increase we delivered in fiscal 2020. On a 2-year stack basis, we delivered 17% sales growth. With rising cost pressures, we experienced declines in gross margin, particularly in Q4, resulting in a decrease of 200 basis points for the fiscal year, which we will discuss in more detail. Fiscal year 2021 adjusted EPS decreased 2% to $7.25. Recognizing the immediate priorities before us, I\u2019d like to reinforce what matters most, long-term profitable growth. With a business that\u2019s significantly larger than before the pandemic and a portfolio of trusted brands exposed to more tailwinds, we have clarity in our strategic imperatives, and I have every confidence in our ability to continue delivering long-term value creation for our shareholders. When I look at fiscal 2021, our performance has shown the strength of our people, brands and products, as well as the resilience of our categories, as we work tirelessly to supply consumers with products across our portfolio. As a result, we experienced significant growth in demand and strengthened our position amongst global consumers, with strong household penetration supported by higher repeat rates across new and existing users. The last 12 months have also demonstrated the need to accelerate our IGNITE strategy, to address near-term headwinds and capitalize on long-term opportunities. The industry environment remains dynamic, with significant inflationary pressure and continuing uncertainty. In the face of these conditions, our top priority is strong execution, to mitigate the impact of elevated cost headwinds and continue to improve market share. The pandemic has also highlighted areas where additional investments can help us be as agile as possible in the future. We are clear on the opportunities ahead of us to differentiate Clorox and build a stronger, more resilient, and more profitable company. This includes driving our growth runways and making investments to enhance our digital capabilities and drive productivity improvements, which I will discuss shortly. We are confident that strong execution of our IGNITE strategy will enable us to achieve our 3% to 5% long-term sales target and deliver long-term shareholder value. Before I discuss Q4 and our progress against our strategy, I\u2019d like to thank our Clorox teammates around the world for everything they\u2019ve accomplished over the past year, as well as their commitment and dedication to serving people and communities around the world. For Q4, faster-than-expected moderating demand for cleaning and disinfecting products, had a pronounced impact on sales growth, as we move through the peak of the pandemic and lapped the unprecedented demand we experienced last year. The magnitude of this quarter\u2019s gross margin contraction was a result of faster-than-expected sales, moderation, acceleration of inflationary headwinds and improvements in supply, which led to broader product assortment, including the reintroduction of value packs. I\u2019ll discuss shortly the actions we\u2019re taking to address these headwinds. Now, let me share a few highlights of our progress on our IGNITE strategy. First, with fuel growth being a critical focus to help address elevated cost pressures, and ensure the long-term health of our brands, I\u2019m pleased we delivered over $120 million in cost savings in the fiscal year, surpassing our annual target. Second, we made strong progress on our 2025 goal to know 100 million people, crossing the halfway mark to our goal this fiscal year. Our higher investment and personalization has led to significantly improved ROI. It has been one of the contributors to increasingly strong payouts, driving our confidence in continued investments in our brands. Third, with innovation at the heart of our strategy, we doubled our innovation investments in fiscal 2021. And new products were a bigger contributor to our top-line, which we expect to continue in fiscal 2022. Next, as consumers have increased their digital usage during the pandemic, we leaned into digital marketing and commerce, resulting in our e-commerce business nearly doubling in the last 2 years, which today represents about 13% of total company sales. Finally, we continue to make progress on our ESG goals. For example, we advanced our commitment to climate action and submitted our proposal on Science Based Targets for our operations, and Scope 3 emissions to the Science Based Target Initiative in June. And as a people-centric company, we continue to focus on the wellbeing of our teammates, and our value-based inclusive culture. I\u2019m particularly proud that during this trying year, we achieved our best safety score in recorded history. With a recordable incident rate of 0.26, significantly lower than the 3.3 industry average. I\u2019m also pleased that in fiscal 2021, we continue to have high employee engagement of 87%, putting us at the top quartile of Fortune 500 companies. Now, let me turn to fiscal 2022. We expect inflationary pressure to persist along with continued moderating demand as we lap COVID-19-related demand surges in the first half of fiscal 2021. While this is reflected in our fiscal 2022 outlook, which Kevin will discuss, by the second half of the year, we expect to be within the lower end of the range of our long-term sales target. Like others in our industry and beyond, we are experiencing significant increases in input and transportation costs across all categories in our portfolio, which have accelerated since Q3, and we\u2019re holistically and dynamically managing this with a laser-focus on rebuilding margin. We implemented pricing on Glad and announced actions on our food, cleaning and international businesses. This represents about 50% of our portfolio. We\u2019re also pursuing pricing in additional parts of our portfolio, which we\u2019ll communicate at the right time. Based on the constructive conversations we\u2019re having with our retail partners, and importantly, the strength of our brands, we feel confident about our ability to execute our pricing plans. In addition, we will continue to drive our hallmark cost savings program. We expect sequential growth margin improvements as we progress through fiscal 2022, with our assumption for gross margin expansion by Q4. In terms of market share, as we\u2019ve discussed previously, we have experienced some declines due to supply challenges, but has made notable progress. With strong investments in internal and external production capacity, including additional manufacturing lines and a significant expansion of our production team, in June we achieved our highest case fill rate since the start of the pandemic. I\u2019m pleased to see that in the latest 13-week data ending July 17, we saw market share gains in 7 out of 9 businesses. Certainly, we recognize there is more work to do in parts of the portfolio, such as Glad trash. And we have adjusted our plans to drive market share improvements over time. Despite these near-term headwinds, we remain focused on our long-term priorities, rooted in our IGNITE strategy, to deliver our long-term growth aspirations. While some pandemic-related behaviors may revert over the next 12 months, we continue to believe there\u2019s been a shift in behaviors that will advantage Clorox longer-term, including a focus on health, wellness and hygiene, more time at home, as well as increased adoption of e-commerce and digital platforms. The pandemic also revealed the urgency to upgrade our digital infrastructure and capabilities. Last year, I brought in Chief Information and Enterprise Analytics Officer, Chau Banks, who has extensive experience in business driven digital transformation to conduct a fresh assessment of our own program that was already underway before the pandemic. With that assessment now complete, we are accelerating our transformation through planned investments of about $500 million over the next 5 years to enhance our digital capabilities and drive productivity improvements, including replacing our ERP. This will enhance our supply chain to better position, Clorox to meet customer needs, yield efficiencies, and support our digital commerce, innovation and brand building efforts. Prior to the pandemic, we were already adapting our business to differentiate Clorox from a digital perspective. We\u2019ll continue to invest in e-commerce and digital marketing across our portfolio, leveraging data driven insights to engage with consumers in more relevant ways. Moving to innovation, innovation continues to be a key focus area for me and our new Chief Growth Officer, Tony Matta, who joined last October. Tony has more than 20 years of brand building experience with leading consumer companies, ensuring we have stickier innovation delivering multi-year value. We\u2019re driving lasting new product platforms, such as Fresh Step Clean Paws and Scentiva, which continue to grow. In addition, we\u2019re extending innovation by leveraging external partners to create new revenue streams. We\u2019re continuing to support our brands, especially margin accretive innovation with disciplined, high ROI advertising and sales promotion investments to build and strengthen consumer loyalty. We also remain very focused on driving our growth runways to build Clorox into a global cleaning and disinfecting brand. We are still in the early stages of a multi-year journey, but continue to believe they can become a meaningful contributor to growth longer-term. And as we execute on all these initiatives, we will continue to drive the strategic link between our societal impact and long-term value creation, as we live our purpose and keep our ESG commitments front and center in our decision making every day. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lisah to review our business unit performance. Lisah Burhan : Thank you, Linda. Now turning to our segment results. In Health and Wellness, Q4 sales decreased 17% for the quarter, while full year sales were up 8% with growth across all businesses. On a two-year stack basis, Q4 sales grew 16% and full year sales grew 22%. In cleaning, sales were down by double-digits compared to double-digit growth in the year ago quarter, primarily due to the deceleration of demand across various cleaning and disinfecting products. On a full year basis, cleaning sales grew behind a strong front half performance. While demand fell faster than anticipated, it remains higher than it was pre-pandemic with strong repeat rates among new buyers. Importantly, our supply and product assortment are almost fully restored, which is reflected in our market share improvements, especially in wipes and sprays. As consumer demand migrated to more preferred forms and value packs. We also saw a negative impact to price mix, which we expect to continue over the next few quarters. Going forward, we\u2019ll be focused on strengthening our merchandising activities, especially for the back-to-school period. Sales in professional products were down by double-digits versus year ago period when we experienced double-digit growth. For the full year, professional product sales were up by double-digits, fueled by an exceptional front half performance. Demand started moderating in Q3, and continued into Q4 as customers work through high inventory levels, especially of Clorox T-360 electrostatic sprayers. In the short-term, we expect results will continue to be volatile as we lap periods with unprecedented demand. Longer-term, this business continues to be a strategic growth area for the company. As part of our initiative to expand into new channels, we continue to add to our roster of out-of-home partnerships, including Live Nation, the world\u2019s leading live events company. Lastly, within the Health and Wellness segment, our vitamins, minerals and supplements business increased by double-digits this quarter after lapping a double-digit decrease caused by a supply disruption related COVID-19. For the full year, sales were up as well. Sales growth for the quarter was driven by a strong performance in the food, drug and mass channel and e-commerce. Turning to the Household segment, Q4 sales were down 8%. Full year sales grew 10% with growth across all 3 businesses. On a two-year stack basis, Q4 sales grew 8% and full year sales grew 12%. Glad sales decreased by double-digits in Q4 lapping strong double-digit growth in the year-ago quarter, which was impacted by initial stockpiling. For the full year, sales were up. Our efforts going forward, our focus on managing the strong inflationary headwinds we\u2019re facing. And as Linda mentioned, we still have more work to do in this business to restore market share. Grilling sales decreased by double-digits in Q4 as demand started moderating after 4 consecutive quarters of strong double-digits growth. For the full year, sales grew by double-digits, fueled by very strong consumption overall. Our focus on expanding distribution of our latest innovation Kingsford pellets continued with a nationwide launch, building on the products initial success, while they\u2019re also introducing signature flavors made with 100% real spices that will be available in select retailers before Labor Day as we gear up for the 2022 grilling season. This innovation is intended to help our business continue building consumption among multicultural millennials, and other healthy growers. Cat Litter sales grew by double-digits in Q4, driven by continued strong consumption. For the full year, litter sales also grew. The results reflected strengthen e-commerce with Fresh Step becoming the number one brand online for the first time and positive overall category trends boosted by record pet adoptions during the pandemic. Going forward, we\u2019re excited about our latest innovation Fresh Step Outstretch litter, which lasts 50% longer than regular litter, thanks to patent pending technology. In our Lifestyle segment, sales were down 3% and full year sales grew 6%. On a two-year stack basis, Q4 sales grew 13% and full year sales grew 16%. Brita sales were down as demand continued to moderate from an extended period of elevated consumption. Full year sales grew on top of double-digit growth in the prior year. Despite the deceleration in Q4, business fundamentals are strong, especially now that our supply is mostly restored. We\u2019re excited about the strong merchandising program we put in place this year, including the largest back to college event ever for the brand. The food business was down primarily due to lower shipments of Hidden Valley Ranch bottle dressings, with consumption moderating as consumer mobility improved. Full year sales were up by double-digits, on top of double-digit growth in the prior year. The consumer fundamentals for this business are strong with the brand growing market share and household penetration. Burt\u2019s Bees sales increased by double-digit this quarter as overall category consumption began to recover. Full year sales were down as category consumption was negatively impacted by store closures, mask mandate and stay-at-home measures. We expect this business to continue to recover as people begin returning to their pre-pandemic shopping patterns and consumer mobility keeps improving. We\u2019ll build on that momentum with our new lips to love campaign supported by strong innovation pipeline. Lastly, turning to international, Q4 sales grew 5% reflecting the combined impact of the Saudi JV acquisition and benefit of price increases partially offset by lower shipments due to moderating demand after a period of elevated consumption. Extended lockdowns in Canada also contributed to the decrease in shipments. The results on top of 12% growth in the year-ago period, when we saw elevated consumption across our portfolio during the early stages of the pandemic, importantly, we continue to expand our global disinfecting wipes business building on the dedicated international supply chain that was developed in 5 months in our making progress launching our Clorox expert disinfecting wipes in existing countries as well as new markets. For the full year, sales increased 14% reflecting very strong growth for the majority of the year before moderating in Q4. On a two-year stack basis, Q4 sales grew 17% and full year sales grew 19%. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss Q4 and full year financial results for FY 2021 as well as our outlook for FY 2022. Kevin Jacobsen : Thank you, Lisah, and thank you everyone for joining us today. As Linda mentioned, for fiscal year 2021, we delivered 9% sales growth on top of 8% sales growth in fiscal year 2020. Well, this is lower than we anticipated in our outlook. We feel good about delivering another strong sales year. Of course, we continue to manage to an extremely challenging cost environment, which impacted our fiscal year margins and earnings. Importantly, we delivered another year of strong cash flow, which came in at $1.3 billion, compared to a record $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2020. I\u2019m pleased our strong cash flow allowed us to return almost $1.5 billion to our shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program, representing an increase of about 90% in cash return to shareholders versus fiscal year 2020. Before review our Q4 results, I wanted to highlight a $28 million non-cash charge we booked in Q4 related to a third-party supplier for our professional products business. As we have shared previously, during the height of the pandemic, we worked with a number of third-party suppliers to support us in addressing unprecedented demand in the consumer and professional spaces. We\u2019re reducing our reliance on one of these suppliers. And as a result, we took a charge in the fourth quarter. Important to note, this non-cash charge is included in our reported EPS and excluded from our Q4 adjusted EPS, as it represents a non-reoccurring item. Turning to our fourth quarter results, fourth quarter sales decreased 9% in comparison to a 22% increase in the year-ago quarter, delivering a two-year stack of 13% sales growth. Our sales results reflected 8% decline organic volume and two-points of unfavorable price mix primarily in our Health and Wellness segment, as supply improvements result in a broader product assortment, including the reintroduction of value packs. On an organic basis, fourth quarter sales declined 10%. Fourth quarter sales were lower than expected primarily in our Health and Wellness segment, as demand for cleaning and disinfecting products moderated more rapidly than we had previously anticipated. While the cleaning and disinfecting category continues to moderate, we\u2019re pleased to see improving share as we increased our ability to supply. Gross margin for the quarter decreased 970 basis points to 37.1% compared to 46.8% in the year ago quarter. Gross margin results were lower than anticipated, largely driven by higher input costs and lower sales. The year-over-year change in Q4 gross margin was primarily driven by lower sales, resulting in lower manufacturing fixed costs absorption as well as a significant cost headwinds driving about 290 basis points of higher commodity costs, 180 basis points of increased transportation costs as well as 130 basis points of unfavorable mix. Our fourth quarter gross margin also includes about 70 basis points of negative impact from the non-cash charges just mentioned. These margin headwinds were partially offset by about 90 basis points of cost savings, and 50 basis points of benefit from our pricing actions in our international division. Selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales came in at 14.4% compared to 14.1% in the year ago quarter. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at about 12% with U.S. spending at about 14% of sales. Strong investments in Q4 supporting our back half innovation program and reflected our continued focus on building loyalty among new consumers. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 0%, primarily driven by a tax benefit from exiting of a small foreign subsidiary, which was mostly offset by the charge we took to pre-tax book income associated with this decision, as well as favorable return to provision adjustments. On a full year basis, our effective tax rate was 20%. Net of all these factors, adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter came in at $0.95 versus $2.41 in the year ago quarter, a decline of 61%. Before I review the details of our outlook, let me provide perspective on the strategic investment, Linda discussed. We\u2019re planning to invest about $500 million over the next 5 years to enhance our digital capabilities and drive productivity improvement, including the replacement of our ERP. In fiscal year 2022, we plan to invest about $90 million in operating and capital expenditures with about $55 million impacting our P&L, and the remainder reflected on our balance sheet. Beginning in Q1 and going forward, our adjusted EPS, will exclude the portion of the $500 million investment that flows through our P&L to provide better insights into our underlying operating performance of our business. Now, turning to our fiscal year 2022 outlook. We anticipate fiscal year sales to be down 2% to 6%, reflecting ongoing demand moderation, primarily in our cleaning and disinfecting products in the front half of the fiscal year. In addition to the unfavorable mix, and higher trade spending, as we move to a more normalized supply and promotional environment. We assume these factors will be partially offset by the pricing actions we\u2019re taking broadly across our portfolio. Organic sales are expected to be down 2% to 6% as well. We expect front-half sales to decline high-single to low-double-digits as we lapped 27% growth in the front-half of this year 2021 during the height of the pandemic. Additionally, we expect Q1 sales to decline low-double-digits. As we move to the back half of the year, we expect to return to the lower-end of our long-term sales growth targets. Of course, we continue to operate in a dynamic and uncertain environment, which could impact our outlook. We anticipate fiscal year gross margin to be down 300 to 400 basis points, due to our assumption for significant ongoing headwinds from elevated commodity and transportation costs, which represent nearly $300 million in year-over-year cost increases. We expect these headwinds to be more pronounced in the front-half of the year, particularly in Q1, as we expect key commodity cost increases to reduce gross margin by about 500 basis points, driving our assumption for Q1 gross margin to decline 1,100 to 1,300 basis points. For perspective, in Q1 we\u2019re lapping a modern gross margin record of 48%, reflecting over 400 basis points of favorable operating leverage on 27% sales growth in the year-ago quarter. As we mentioned in our press release, we expect sequential improvement for gross margin over the course of fiscal year 2022, with the assumption for gross margin expansion in Q4. This is based on our assumption that cost inflation will begin to moderate. And then, we\u2019ll see the benefits from mitigating actions flow more fully through our P&L. We expect fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to be about 15% of sales, which includes about 1 point of impact related to our investment to enhance our digital capabilities. Additionally, we anticipate fiscal year advertising spending to be about 10% of sales, reflecting our ongoing commitment to invest behind our brands and build market share. We expect our fiscal year tax rate to be about 22% to 23%. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects lapping several onetime benefits in the prior fiscal year. Net of these factors, we anticipate fiscal year adjusted EPS to be between $5.40 to $5.70. As we start fiscal year 2022, I\u2019d like to emphasize our priority to address elevated cost pressures, from both commodities and transportation throughout the fiscal year. We are focused on executing the pricing actions we discussed today. We\u2019ve implemented our announced price increase on our bags and wraps, and are taking pricing on our Food, Cleaning and International businesses. This represents about 50% of our portfolio. We\u2019re also pursuing pricing and additional parts of our portfolio, which we\u2019ll announce at a later date. While it\u2019s still early, we are confident in our ability to price, given the strength of our brand, and the constructive conversations we\u2019re having with retailers. Consistent with our IGNITE strategy, we\u2019re addressing short-term headwinds head on, with an eye on the long-term health of our business. We will continue to invest in our brands, including meaningful innovation to drive differentiation, which will help us continue to drive superior consumer value. We are leaning into our cost-savings program and productivity initiatives to help address ongoing cost pressures. And, we\u2019re accelerating investments in our digital transformation, to drive increased capabilities, lower costs across our supply chain, and improve innovation efforts and our brand engagement activities. And finally, as Linda mentioned, our business is significantly larger than before the pandemic and we\u2019re well positioned for the future. Our global portfolio of trusted brands is more relevant than ever. And we\u2019re positioning ourselves to make the most of the changing consumer trends we see. We have confidence in our strategic plans and our ability to execute, to enable us to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Linda. Linda Rendle : Thank you, Kevin. Before we open the line for questions, I wanted to take a moment to reiterate our commitment to and confidence in Clorox\u2019 long-term growth and value-creation potential, which is fueled by our IGNITE strategy. We\u2019re focused on strong execution in the face of dynamic conditions, including addressing significant cost headwinds and improving market share. In addition, we have clarity on the strategic imperative and executional mandate to differentiate Clorox and build a stronger, more resilient, and more profitable company. And as we accelerate and execute our IGNITE strategy, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll drive improved performance. Christy, you may now open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Rendle. [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. So 2 questions, just first on the $500 million investment program on digital and productivity, could you just give us a better sense for why the program is necessary now? We\u2019ve heard the IGNITE strategy has been working the last couple of years. We\u2019ve heard historically that you\u2019re ahead of the curve in competition on the e-commerce side from you guys, and happy with innovation progress. So sounds like there was a review when you took over Linda, and obviously, Chau Bank\u2019s appointment. But I\u2019m sure you were focused on these areas before also. So, was this a surprise? How did it develop, particularly given it\u2019s such a large amount? And then, as we think about the payback, is this what\u2019s necessary to get back to long-term goals that at some point, in theory, sometimes a big spending program can yield payback above and beyond prior goals? I\u2019m assuming at this point, it\u2019s more to help return to prior long-term goals. And then, I also have a second question on gross margins if I can come back. Thanks. Linda Rendle : Sure, Dara. Thank you. So why don\u2019t we start with your first question, why necessary now? And what\u2019s clear is the pandemic has absolutely accelerated consumer digital behaviors in a way that we never contemplated during our IGNITE strategy. And certainly, we saw that as a key consumer tailwind for us as we penned that strategy. But we\u2019ve seen such a rapid movement online by consumers, both in the e-commerce space, and then certainly in the marketing consumption space, that we really knew we need to take a step back and look at the program that we had in place, and ensure that it was sufficient for us to deliver as we move forward, and what we look towards across the entire operation. And I think the other thing that I would note is, our challenges in fiscal year 2021, managing the type of volatility that we haven\u2019t been exposed to in the past, underscored the urgency to upgrade that digital infrastructure and capabilities. And what I want to make clear is, this is really not about today, this is about maintaining momentum as we come out of our IGNITE strategy period. And you\u2019ll see the bulk of the value of this comes after our IGNITE strategy period, so 2025 and beyond. This will allow us to have really real-time access to data and information that will help our entire operation move more efficiently and better serve consumer and customer needs. So we\u2019ll make first investment in our ERP, which is the foundation and infrastructure of all of these changes. And that\u2019s needed and accelerated to build these digital capabilities. We\u2019ll have better supply chain visibility across all parts of the supply chain with real time data, which will improve things like procurement and supply planning. It will further enhance the work that you already referenced, that we\u2019ve done on digital and e-commerce and further enhance our ability to do personalization, and get more out of that goal, and will help us on innovation. So really, what this was about was the change in circumstances and the environment, a rapid change in consumer behavior that couldn\u2019t have been predicted before the pandemic, and we\u2019re leaning in. And this is really about building a stronger company with more momentum coming out of the strategy period. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. And then, could you just talk a little bit about the yield from this, how we should think about that in terms of timing and magnitude over time? And then second, Kevin, on gross margins, when you include the guidance for fiscal 2022, you\u2019re obviously experiencing a lot of gross margin depression over a 2-year period, probably record amount of compression. So I\u2019m just trying to understand your focus on pricing. It seems like the magnitude and timing of the pricing is less than what we\u2019ve seen in the past versus these unprecedented cost pressure. So I just want to understand why we\u2019re not seeing a greater offset through pricing. Is pricing more difficult in this environment from a retailer or competitive perspective? Is it more \u2013 some of the pressure was unexpected? Are there other pressure points of gross margin? How do you sort of think about and help us understand why we\u2019re not seeing more of an offset to those outsized cost pressures like we\u2019re seeing with some of your peers? Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah, Dara, thanks for the question. And let me share our perspective on gross margin. If I think about where we were before the pandemic, our gross margin was just below 44%, about 43.9%. As we moved through the pandemic over the last couple of years, we ended this year about 43.6%, so just a little below where we were before the pandemic began. As we go forward, as both Linda and I talked about in our prepared remarks, we are facing what we\u2019re describing as unprecedented cost environment in terms of inflation. Just, Dara, for perspective, as I mentioned before, we\u2019re going to experience, we think about $300 million of cost increases this year between both commodities and transportation. That\u2019s about a 400 basis point hit to gross margin this year. Now, from the pricing actions we\u2019re taking, we think we can offset about 2/3rds of those this year, with the pricing actions we\u2019ve announced plus the more we\u2019ll announce at a later date. And then, we expect to fully offset the cost increase going forward. But that\u2019ll extend beyond fiscal year 2022, just based on the phasing of these actions we\u2019re taking. And so, I feel confident we\u2019ll recover these. But they\u2019ll take a little longer beyond 2022. And then the other items, Dara, I\u2019d point out to be aware of, as you think about our margin in fiscal year 2022. There are 2 other items. We had a temporary benefit during the pandemic as it relates to mix, as well as trade spending. As I think you know, for many of our categories, there is very limited promotional activity, because of lack of supply. We expect that is temporary and expect that to reverse out as we get back to a more normalized promotional environment. So we think about fiscal year 2022, I expect about 50 bps of headwind from higher trade spending. And then, also on mix, when the pandemic hit and we rationalized our production, try to get as much product out as possible, we ran 35 count canisters, an example on why, because we could run most of those. As we introduced larger sizes, as we introduced multi-packs, which is very good for consumption and trial, that will come in as a lower margin as well. So you\u2019ll see that positive mix turn negative, as we get back into a more normal level of skew offerings. And so, that\u2019s about another 100 basis point hit, we\u2019re going to see in 2022. Now, both of those are temporary benefits as a result of the pandemic that we expect to unwind. And they will unwind this year and get back to more normalized level. And so, I think what\u2019s important as we go through the year, and you think about the phasing of our margins, the biggest challenge we\u2019re going to face is in the front half. When you think about the cost environment I highlighted, we expect to take about 75% of those cost increases in the front half of the year. And then, you\u2019ll see sequential improvements as we move through the year and turn back to margin expansion. I expect ours \u2013 we get to Q4 and we start recovering some of these costs that you should see our gross margins back in the low 40%s. And we\u2019re committed to rebuilding it back to where we were before the pandemic began. Let me stop there and happy to take any follow-ups. Dara Mohsenian : Yeah, just on the timing of pricing, it does seem like it\u2019s taking longer than it has previously. Obviously, a lot of compression year-over-year in Q4, almost 1,000 basis points. And we\u2019re not expecting positive gross margins until you get to Q4 of next year. So I\u2019d be curious for your thoughts, specifically around the pricing offset. I understand there are issues like mix and some of the other issues you mentioned. But it does seem like it\u2019s taking a long period of time to get pricing in, relative to history. So just trying to understand that. Linda Rendle : Yeah, timing is related to the commitment that we made at the beginning of the pandemic. And we continue to hold fast to, which is our absolute number one priority was to supply as much of the demand as we possibly could. And that continue to be our priority as we headed through Q4. We made the immediate call to price on Glad, given what we were seeing in resin. And that will go in market shortly. And we were doing the work behind the scenes to ready pricing across the rest of the portfolio as needed. Clearly, we\u2019re going to need to pull that lever and we are with about 50% announced to date and plans to take additional pricing that will communicate more details around coming up in the future. But it really was about that continued priority of meeting as much demand as we possibly could. Dara Mohsenian : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Peter Grom of UBS. Peter Grom : Hey, hey, good afternoon, everyone. So my question is just more on the conservatism and the guidance at this point. I know there are a lot of moving parts here. But I think a lot of investors are kind of asking, is the company being prudent, conservative, lowering the bar, whatever term you really want to use or you\u2019ve embedded in the flex that even if trends deteriorate from here, is this guidance range still achievable? I think I know the operating environment is very different. And I\u2019m not sure I would necessarily call this a rebase versus what we\u2019ve seen in the past. But it will be helpful to get your view on how much flex there is in this guidance, should inflation rise or consumer demand fall more from here? Thanks. Kevin Jacobsen : Hey, Peter, this is Kevin. Thank you for the question. On our outlook, what I\u2019d say is I don\u2019t view this as conservative. I view this as balanced. I think you folks all know, we are operating in an environment of unprecedented volatility, as you think about the changing consumer demand, the macroeconomy as well as, how the virus is going to play out. And so we recognize, we\u2019ve been operating this environment for the better part of the last 18 months and we expect that to continue. I would say that\u2019s certainly true in the front half of 2022. And then, our hope is we\u2019ll start to see it level out a bit in the back half and get to more normalized environment. And so, you should expect ongoing volatility in the front half. The way, Peter, we try to account for that is, we provide a bit of a wider range in our outlook than what we would normally provide at this time of the year. And we just think that\u2019s prudent to recognize the level of variability we have. But I would describe this as a balanced forecast based on everything we\u2019re seeing today. Peter Grom : Okay, super helpful. And then, just quickly, just maybe a point of clarification on Dara\u2019s a question or your response to Dara\u2019s question. Returning to 40% in Q4, does that mean that you don\u2019t expect to be about 40% gross margins until Q4? I just want to make sure I\u2019m thinking about that in the model correctly? Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. So, Peter, the way we\u2019re envisioning this playing out over the course of the years, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we expect Q1 to be down about 1,100 to 1,300 basis points, primarily driven by the cost environment. I\u2019ll talk more about that in a moment. And then, we expect sequential improvements as we move through the year. And by the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll turn to margin growth. And then, what we expect is, by the fourth quarter, we\u2019ve got margins back in the low 40%s. With our expectation going forward into 2023 and while I\u2019m not providing an outlook today, I would say on margin, we fully expect to continue expand margins as we move into fiscal year 2023. Peter Grom : Okay, great. Thank you. Super helpful. Best of luck. Kevin Jacobsen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Wendy Nicholson of Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi, a couple of questions. First of all, with the amount of money you\u2019re spending on the new digital ERP investments, what\u2019s your expectation for kind of capital allocation, potentially, to step in and support the stock and buy back stock here, because I know your leverage is still really low compared to your peers? But then, Linda, kind of stepping back aside from near-term, the guidance for 2022 gross margin, I mean, I\u2019ve covered this stuff for 20 years and I have to go back literally 20 years to find a 40% gross margin for the company. And I totally get that we\u2019re in a weird period with COVID. And you made a commitment to not raise prices. And I think that\u2019s great. But I think it begs the question, is there something structural in the business, when you mentioned higher promotional spending. I mean, this does not seem like the time to be investing in promotional spending when you\u2019re also raising prices, and you\u2019ve got so much commodity inflation. So sort of a year into your job as the new CEO, do you think a mid-40%s gross margin is the right number and this really is a temporary blip? Or is this a sort of, \u201cHey, we may be over-earning on the gross margin line. And, low-40%s or even high-30%s is really where we\u2019re sort of more normally positioned?\u201d Sorry for the long question, but the guidance for 40% gross margin just seems crazy to me. Linda Rendle : Sure, Wendy. I\u2019ll start with the second part of the question, then I\u2019ll hand it over to Kevin to talk a bit more about capital allocation on your first question. So what we\u2019re seeing and you said it, it\u2019s absolutely an extraordinary environment. And if you look at all the factors combined, and what\u2019s contributing to our gross margin, I hate this term a little bit, but it\u2019s really the perfect storm, where we\u2019re lapping incredible sales growth, and things like operating leverage. We are lapping promotional levels being down. And I would argue promotional levels for us are our strategic. We\u2019ve always viewed that investment, just like we do our marketing dollars, it helps us build trial, it helps us expose consumers to things like innovation. And that\u2019s going to continue to be important in the future. And it\u2019s why we want to put that money back in the system to ensure as we have record-setting innovation coming into the marketplace, from a top-line perspective, that we\u2019re able to support it with those dollars. And then, of course, the cost environment at which, I think, we\u2019re seeing broadly and it\u2019s not just a Clorox issue, but certainly an industry problem. So all of that is happening at once. What that leads me to is, this is natural issue. This is a temporary issue, albeit an extraordinary one. And we\u2019re managing with discipline. And I think the good news for us is we\u2019ve managed albeit not this deep, but certainly environments that have happened like this over time. And what we do is go to work and execute, and we\u2019re going to do it just like that in the past. We\u2019re going to take pricing, and you\u2019re going to see much more pricing come from us now as it starts to pick up and we\u2019ve improved supply as we\u2019ve spoken about. We\u2019re going to put our cost savings machine to work with the mandate to our team to remove any costs that are possible in the system. And that\u2019s what they are focused on every single day right now. And we\u2019re going to take it one day at a time and execute it. But I feel confident in our ability to get back to what Kevin spoke about, and get back to those margins. It\u2019s just not going to happen this year. Again, we\u2019ll see improvement in Q4 and continued improvement as we move through fiscal 2023. But we do view this as a temporary issue. Kevin Jacobsen : And, Wendy, on capital allocation, I\u2019d tell you, there is no change in our priorities in terms of how we\u2019re going to allocate our capital. And as you know, our first priority will continue to invest in our base business. And that includes our digital investments. Both Linda and I spoke about that today. And so, if you think about where we were last year, we ramped up investments in our base business, both investing in innovation, investing in brand building, as well as investing in increasing production capacity within our supply network, primarily focused on increasing our wipes capacity. And so, as we move into fiscal year 2022, as we\u2019ve gotten through some of those investments in our facilities, you should see our capital spending return down more in our normalized range of 3% to 4% of sales we typically operate, and you should expect that this year. And then we will deploy a certain amount of capital towards this technology investment. The way I see this $500 million playing out is about 60% of it will flow through our P&L, and about 40% of that will flow through our balance sheet. And if you think specifically about fiscal year 2022, we\u2019re going to invest about $90 million, with about $35 million flowing through our balance sheet, will deploy cash. And then, after we invest in the base business, we\u2019ll continue to look for ways to return excess cash to shareholders. Last year, we generated tremendous amount of cash through the pandemic, and we returned almost $1.5 billion. I suspect this year, because of the challenging cost environment, and the reduced profitability we\u2019ll return closer somewhere between $700 million and $900 million between our dividend and our share buyback program. But I\u2019d also highlight, if you look at our dividend program, with our recent increase we announced back in June, we now have an average annual increase of a little over 7% over the last 5 years. And that puts us in the top third of our peer group. So I think we have committed to continually returning excess cash to our shareholders. And we\u2019ve operated fairly high level than our peer set and you should expect us to do that going forward. Wendy Nicholson : Okay, that\u2019s great. And just on the digital investment, what\u2019s the sort of payback timing for that? I mean, when should we start to see whether this investment was worth it, if you will, bottom line? Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah, Wendy, thanks for that question. So this is really an investment in setting our future. You\u2019ll start to see some of that payback late in our IGNITE strategy towards the tail-end of it. But this is really about setting up the company to be prepared to succeed over the long term. And so we\u2019ll invest the $500 million over the next 5 years. You should see an investment starting or return starting late in our IGNITE period, late 2024, 2025. And then, really accelerating as we get beyond IGNITE. And then, Wendy, our commitment is we\u2019ll continue to update folks exactly on our progress and both our investments and the returns we\u2019re generating on that investment. Wendy Nicholson : Great. Thank you so much for the color. Kevin Jacobsen : Thank you, Wendy. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Chris Carey, of Wells Fargo Securities. Christopher Carey : Hi, everyone. Kevin Jacobsen : Hi, Chris. Christopher Carey : I want to understand, you made some comments of your quarter about the Health and Wellness business normalizing to something like $700 million or below run-rate, which could have played out this quarter. But that business could grow from that over time. And I\u2019m curious, your thoughts on timeline of that trajectory from where we are today. What you think is going to be developing over that time period, whether that\u2019s professional, getting back in stock in some of your businesses, the promotional spending or the pricing? And, I guess, underlying that question as well, as I\u2019m conscious, of course, that the Health and Wellness business has really tough comps in the first half. But the Household business also has pretty difficult comps, and the Grilling business is normalizing. And, just trying to get a sense of, if this trajectory is playing out in Health and Wellness? What you kind of see in your Household business for the first half of the year? I guess, back of the envelope math would just suggest that you kind of need to see some improvement on a stack basis there. And whether I\u2019m thinking about that correctly? And then, I just have a quick follow-up. Linda Rendle : Sure, Chris, I\u2019ll start with Cleaning. I think this is absolutely a dynamic time for cleaning, given all of the volatility. But there were 2 things that we said at the beginning. We believe that this was a change in consumer behavior that would be long-term. And the evidence continues to support that that is absolutely the case. So if you just look at some of the consumption numbers, even though it did decelerate faster than we expected, as vaccination rates picked up, at least until we got to the point we are today, you still see a very strong 2-year stack of growth. So in Q4, that was over 20% for our cleaning business. But also, if you look at consumption, that\u2019s been up in the range from 25% to 30% versus pre-pandemic level. So we really are seeing that behavior be sticky with consumers. Of course, we\u2019re lapping incredible growth in those businesses, and frankly, demand that we couldn\u2019t supply early in the pandemic. So what you\u2019re seeing is a normalization, but as we said, a significantly higher run rate moving forward. And we expect that to continue, exactly, where that will net out is still unknown. And, I think, there\u2019s a lot of unknowns moving forward. Delta certainly is an unknown, cold and flu season, et cetera. But we have continued confidence that this will be a long-term trend that we can grow off and will provide us the opportunity to accelerate profitable growth. And as we talked about raising ourselves target to 3 to 5, this is a portion of that. So continue confidence there. Again, I would say, though, as we look to the first half, and as we lap 27% sales growth overall for the company, for cleaning and disinfecting, and for our household business. We won\u2019t expect to deliver accelerated results versus that period. But as we start to lap in the back half is when we get to the low end of our sales algorithm, and seeing both cleaning and disinfecting, and our household business contributing positively to that. Christopher Carey : Okay. Yeah, thank you for that. Kevin, did you have something \u2013 I just have a quick follow-up. Just on the Health and Wellness margin in the quarter, I appreciate, there was a mix dynamics and volume deleveraging, but obviously, it was quite low, well below our model. And any perspective on, can you expand just on what exactly is occurring in that business? And how we should be thinking about the margin trajectory, they\u2019re going into fiscal 2022 and, perhaps, why that\u2019s going to be improved? Thanks so much. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah, Chris, as it relates to margin on our Health and Wellness segment, I would highlight a few items. The one is, as I mentioned, we took a charge as it relates to a PPD supplier that impacted our Health and Wellness segment, and that was about 11 points in terms of margin. That was non-cash that won\u2019t continue going forward. And then also keep in mind, we are lapping 85% growth in the Q4 prior year, so we\u2019re lapping a big year-over-year number, as well as we\u2019re dealing with increased costs. So, I think, it goes back to what we\u2019re talking about. We\u2019re dealing with a very challenging cost environment in a very near-term, and that\u2019s going to pressure margins. But we do think this is short-term, we continue to have tremendous confidence that we\u2019re going to be able to expand margins as we get into the back half of fiscal year 2022, and then on into 2023. But we have to recognize it in the very near-term is going to challenge margins. You saw that in the fourth quarter, and you\u2019ll see that in the first half of fiscal year 2022. Christopher Carey : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good morning, folks, or good afternoon, I guess, depending where you are. A couple of quick questions. First, real quick on cash flow, have you given free cash flow guidance? If not, can you? And you\u2019ve got this target out there free cash flow conversion as a percentage of sales 11% to 13%. As you migrate away from gap and start excluding things, should we expect that that ratio to move lower or for you to lower end of that ratio? Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. Jason, on cash flow, as you rightfully said, our target is 11% to 13%. We\u2019ve done very well against that target. If you look at fiscal year 2020, the height of the pandemic, we\u2019ve delivered a little bit over 19% in terms of cash flow, as a percent of sales. We had a good strong year in fiscal year 2021, we ended up at 12.9%. I would say this year, given the challenges on the cost environment, I expect, we\u2019re going to be at the low end of that range. So I think closer to 11%, if not slightly below that. But that\u2019s really a reflection of the more challenging cost environment. Long-term, we have tremendous confidence that we continue to deliver that 11% to 13% going forward. Jason English : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And, Linda, I know you\u2019re pleased with the market share progress, but if we look at it versus pre-COVID levels, particularly for your cleaning segment. You\u2019re still well below where you are pre-COVID, even here in July and, in fact, if I look at like multipurpose cleaning \u2013 multipurpose clean spray or cleaning wipes, it\u2019s only gotten worse versus 2019 for the last couple of months. Is this the reason that your progress on pricing is so slow? Is it to try to sort of reset some price gaps and become more competitive to current market share? Or is it in fact due to like the service levels you mentioned and really the need to restore them first before we were able to start to push through pricing with retailers? Linda Rendle : Thanks, Jason. I would say, I\u2019m very pleased with our share results, given the environment that we have. We\u2019re seeing significant increased competition and we had supply challenges given the unprecedented demand and we\u2019re making, in my view, great progress. So share up in 7 of 9 businesses. If you look at the latest 13 weeks, we widened our share gap in wipes back to double digits and growing, and that\u2019s with significantly new competitive entries in the category, we grew [bread at] [ph] 8 share points. And we have a very strong start to back to school, and that programs working well continued strong Kingsford share growth, after many quarters in a row of share growth in Kingsford. And you\u2019ve heard my commitment, and I continue to stand by it, we remain committed to growing share. And we\u2019re focused on that fiscal 2022, and headed in absolutely the right direction. And I\u2019ve also called up places where I\u2019m not as happy, I\u2019m still not happy on where we are in Glad, we have work to do there, we\u2019re focused on the fundamentals and executing. And this really is completely unrelated to pricing, Jason. Pricing really has to do from a timing perspective with ensuring that we had the supply and then going back and working with our retail partners to ensure that we could implement the new plans in place. That really is the only reason why we\u2019ve delayed that. We will, of course, do the very important work you call out on price gaps as we move forward and that will be important. But given the incredible cost environment we see across the industry, we would expect to see categories moves, and we\u2019ll move along with them. And then we\u2019ll do the work to go back and ensure that we\u2019re in those right gaps. And then the other piece I would add Jason is our brands have never been stronger. And that was our goal exiting fiscal year 2021 was to be in a stronger position to grow off of this new significantly higher base. If you look at our household penetration, repeat rates, our consumer value. And as you know, we measured the percentage of our portfolio that is deemed superior by consumers that set a record high at 70%. So we feel fully confident in our ability to take pricing with the consumer. And then, of course, it\u2019ll be met with great marketing spend and innovation to continue to support that demand. Jason English : Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Jason. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Great, thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions on your outlook. So first, just from an organic sales perspective, you\u2019re expecting down 2% to 6%. My question is perhaps for Kevin, what is embedded in that for category growth building on some of the prior questions, you sound pleased for the most part with some of the market share improvement? So is that reflective, generally of what you expect for the categories that you participate in? I\u2019ll be it against some difficult year-over-year comps in the first half of the year. And then a little bit longer term, I don\u2019t want to belabor this, but maybe I\u2019ll just kind of play it back. And you tell me if I\u2019m hearing this sort of correctly, the longer-term margin restoration now for this company. Linda, I think to an earlier question, you said you don\u2019t see this as a structurally lower margin business. Kevin, I think, you kind of alluded to this is probably a multi-year journey, though, to get back. So down materially this year, some improvement in fiscal 2023, but probably not getting back to what would be quote unquote, normal sort of margins for this business until fiscal 2024, 2025, maybe you can just confirm that, and I have a quick follow-up on pricing? Thank you. Kevin Jacobsen : Hey, Kevin, thanks for the question. So on the 2, on organic sales growth, our assumption in the minus 6 to minus 2, is it we\u2019ll see modest category decline, as we see demand moderate, and the other pandemic, and then that\u2019ll be partially offset by share growth broadly across our portfolio. And so that\u2019s embedded in our assumptions for organic sales growth. And then on margin restoration, what I\u2019ll tell you is we are committed to recovering the cost inflation we\u2019re experiencing this year. And as I said, between our cost savings program and the pricing actions we\u2019re taking and the phasing of those pricing actions, we think that\u2019ll extend beyond this fiscal year. And so I see this more as a short-term issue, but medium- to long-term, I have confidence in our ability to get back to that mid-gross margin number. I\u2019m going to resist providing a gross margin outlook for fiscal year 2023. It\u2019s just too early to do that and there\u2019s a lot of moving parts. But embed in our assumptions right now is, we\u2019ll see a moderation in the commodity environment as we get through the end of this calendar year. And if that commodity environment moderates as we anticipate plus the pricing actions we\u2019re taking, you\u2019ll see a start to rebuild margin, and then continue into fiscal year 2023. And, Kevin, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen this before. But if you go back and you look at some of our previous pricing actions over the last decade, we\u2019ve done this 3 other times. And in all cases, what you saw was a margin decline in the year when the commodity costs spike. And then we went on to rebuild margins in subsequent years. And most recently, in fiscal 2018, if you recall, we had 9 straight quarters of gross margin expansion following our pricing actions. And so my expectation is, you\u2019ll see something similar where we\u2019ll start Q4, and then I\u2019ll continue on into the fiscal year 2023. Kevin Grundy : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then the quick follow-up is just, I think, the comment was you price on 50% of the portfolio. I suppose maybe some questions on why the delay in doing that. But setting that aside, I guess, understanding some of the past competitive dynamics, what\u2019s the probability of pricing on the remaining 50%? Understanding there has to be a cost justification, but difficult to envision many categories where there\u2019s not talk about the decision there? What\u2019s going on price gaps versus private label game theory versus the competition? Why not moving on the other 50%? Or maybe sort of some further color on expectations there? And then, I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you. Linda Rendle : Sure, yeah, on the 50%, as we said, I think in an earlier answer, and in our prepared remarks. It means, we\u2019ve announced pricing of about 50% to date, and we are planning additional pricing that will speak a little bit more once the details are in market. And really, there were considerations across how we would do that at what credit categories and what time, and we really took the category by category, it started with that first principle that I spoke about, which is we had to ensure we were in the right supply position as a starting place, before we did that. And as we\u2019ve brought supply back online, we\u2019ve opened more and more of our categories to looking at that. And then, of course, we\u2019re doing the really important work to look at each category, look at the dynamics, our position in that, what our innovation and marketing plans look like and balancing that across every one of the categories, because what we\u2019re really here to do is maximize the long-term on this. And what we want to ensure is that pricing as a part of that way that we restore margins, but also that we don\u2019t give up the opportunities we see in front of us to accelerate overall long-term profitable growth, and that\u2019s the balance we\u2019ve gone through on every category. But, I think, what you\u2019re going to see from us as this all nets out, is that we\u2019re taking a very prudent stance on pricing. It will be a meaningful contributor to gross margin expansion as we move through the year. And as Kevin said, we have all confidence that as we move beyond that, we\u2019ll be able to restore margins with pricing as an important part of that. Kevin Grundy : Okay. Very good. Thank you both. Good luck. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Kevin. Kevin Jacobsen : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping if you could just give us a little bit of color do you have it on where you think retailer inventories currently stand and same for PPD and any research you\u2019ve done on consumer pantries that you\u2019ve built in the category correction in the first half. But I\u2019m just curious, where you stood on retail inventory levels in particular in PPD? Thanks. Linda Rendle : Sure, Lauren, broadly as we look across retail inventory is given the good supply progress that we made in Q4, we have largely restored inventories across the bulk of our portfolio. We do have some additional work to do on the broader assortment, a few packs and cleaning and disinfecting here and there, and still have some work to do on Kingsford and Food. But largely, I would say on the retail side inventories are restored, we\u2019ll see how that plays out, of course, as delta takes on et cetera, how those inventories continue to progress as we go through the first half of the year, but largely in a good spot now. In the professional business, it is different. So if you look at the front half of fiscal year 2021, we had a 70% increase in sales for our professional products business. And then we had a big drop off of that in our back half, as we\u2019ve talked about in both sets of results. And what we\u2019ve uncovered is there just looks like there\u2019s a lot of inventory in the professional channel. Given that, that front half that we experienced and it\u2019s not just our inventory, it\u2019s actually inventory across all manufacturers. And that network is primarily supplied by distributors. And so having visibility into each point of that supply, we do now when we realized there is more inventory there. So that means, as we left that 70% growth in the front half of fiscal 2022. And we start to read down that inventory, it is going to be bumpy in the short-term, continue to have strong confidence in our ability to grow PPD, you look at the two-year stack growth, its 35% sales growth. But I think it is going to be bumpy here as we left this front half, having the inventory on the system and then lapping an incredibly strong first half of last year. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s super helpful. And then, I have a question about variety, you\u2019ve talked about how obviously during the height of the pandemic to increase throughput SKU rationalization and the smaller packs in particular now bringing some of those value packs back in and then larger sizes. Did you consider using this as sort of an opportunity to intentionally kind of streamline mix? Is everyone in the industry of revenue growth management, right, but ways to actually improve the profitability of what you do choose to merchandise, because I would have thought that that could also give you a bit more flexibility and particularly as you\u2019re going through this cost environment? Linda Rendle : Yeah, absolutely. We\u2019ve spoken about adding net revenue management more aggressively to our toolbox to deal with margin moving forward and that is absolutely the plan. So 2 things. One, as we brought SKUs back into assortment we did just that, Lauren, we did not bring back the full assortment, we took the opportunity to simplify which helps us in many areas in the cost lines and P&L. But also from a retailer perspective, optimizing their mix and leveraging their store shelf space, as well as online mix in the right way. So you will see a smaller assortment, our goal is to ensure that we had share of assortment, right? But in full knowing that distribution points might come down, and we\u2019re certainly seeing that play out. But your point moving forward is exactly right. We intend to use more net revenue management tools, which would include things like assortments and getting the mix right to drive margin over time, and all of our business units are developing plans to use that as a bigger lever moving forward. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Great. And then, Kevin, if I just can sneak in one more, I did have a question for you on the charge this quarter related to the PPD supplier, either just be helpful to better understand what was underlined next, because if it was you discussed, paying up for supply, which obviously given the commitment that the company made to supply these critical products during a very tough time is important. But I\u2019m just not sure \u2013 I\u2019m curious if the charge piece of this like why that choice would effectively be excluded from results. And I know this is backward looking. But I think it\u2019s just helpful to get that perspective. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. Sure, Lauren, happy to talk about the charge we took. So as we mentioned, we took a $28 million charge in the fourth quarter. And this was related to a PPD supplier. And what this related to it very early in the pandemic, when we saw the unprecedented increase in demand, we invested to help scale this supplier up to help increase their ability to supply products. And so what we\u2019ve done now is as they\u2019ve done that they\u2019ve had some challenges more recently, and we made a decision, we\u2019re going to move away from them. And so what we\u2019re doing here is we wrote off the investments we made in that supplier, which was really done to help scale them back when the pandemic first began. And at this point, we\u2019ve moved our business away to other suppliers. So we think, we\u2019re in good shape going forward from a production perspective. And then, we excluded this as a non-reoccurring non-cash item in terms of the charge we took in Q4. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Thanks so much. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. Thanks, Lauren. Linda Rendle : Thanks Lauren. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Stephen Powers of Deutsche Bank. Stephen Powers : Hey, thanks very much. Hey, Linda and maybe Kevin as well, I listened to the discussion on the strategic investments that we started with, and it makes good sense to me logically, I\u2019m not today in the \u2013 the business case at all. But, I guess, I\u2019m not clear on why we\u2019re adjusting out those investments from recurring EPS. And, I know, we talked about this move to adjust their earnings last quarter, and I get the rationale to provide investors clarity. But the other one time gain or a charge for impairment, I think, that\u2019s different than what I\u2019m hearing, which is backing out strategic investments for a pretty long time, 5 years after years of not doing so. So just why are these investments different from what I perceive you guys, who have been doing proactively for the last several \u2013 any number of years to get you in a position where you are now? It seems almost normal course in evergreen for Clorox. So, I guess, there\u2019s more clarity on why these particular investments are unique and different enough for you to consider them non-recurring worthy of adjustment that would just help philosophically on this idea of adjusted earnings. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah, Steve, this is Kevin. Thanks for the question. I say about these investments, a couple of thoughts. The one is just in terms of the size and investment. So as we mentioned, $500 million over 5 years is a big investment for us. The vast majority of that investment will go towards are replacing our ERP system. So I think this is pretty typical for large ERP investments that you typically do only once every 20 years or so to isolate that. So people can understand the investments we\u2019re making there, versus underlying performance of the business. And then the other aspect on this investment, and Linda mentioned it, this investment really is about the future of the company, much more sales and what\u2019s going to do to benefit our IGNITE strategy through 2025. And so we\u2019re making some pretty significant investments here, both in replacing our ERP as well as up-scaling our digital capabilities that really will start to benefit us as we move beyond 2025 our IGNITE strategy. So we thought it\u2019s appropriate to be able to isolate these and help folks understand your underlying operating performance, which has been pretty volatile as well as the investments we\u2019re making really set the company up for the long-term. Stephen Powers : Okay. Okay, fair enough. You talked a little bit about this already, but the building blocks, Kevin from the double-digit declines in the first quarter to achieving the low-end of the long-term algorithm in the back half. Can you just talk a little bit more about just, for my own benefit, that the bridge from 1Q the back half and really, where your confidence comes from that 3% plus will be kind of achievable in the back half and extrapolating forward? Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah, thanks, Steve. So if you think about the top-line, the front half of the year, we said it\u2019s going to be much more challenged a big portion that is we\u2019re lapping 27% growth. So we had record growth in the back half \u2013 or, excuse me, the front half of fiscal 2021, we\u2019ve got a lap. As a result of that, we expect our business to be down high-single, low-double digits. I think, we\u2019re getting to the back half the year. And we get back to more normalized comps. And we think we\u2019ve gotten through the bulk of the demand moderation that we expect in the front half of the year that gives us more confidence that we\u2019re going to be in a more normalized operating environment with more normalized comparison periods, that we should be back in that 3% range or so. Linda and I continue to have tremendous confidence in the opportunity for the extra point of growth, I think a little bit out of getting hidden by the comps we\u2019re going through in the normalization. And so that\u2019s really a short-term issue for us that we think plays out over the next 6 months. But as we look to the back half of the year, and we think we get to a more normalized environment, then I think you\u2019ll start to see the benefits we\u2019ve been talking about that we can to see going forward, that we think is really a medium- to long-term opportunity. Stephen Powers : Okay, great. And if I could squeeze one more clarifying in your release, Kevin, there was a line about unfavorable price mix driven by supply improvements that led to the reintroduction of value packs. I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s all mix. But it does a price mix, if there was a price component to that, could you just talk about that? Or is it \u2013 am I right that it was essentially mix? Kevin Jacobsen : It was essentially mixed in terms of the headwind, the less favorable pricing, because we continue to price in international. So we had about a point benefit in price within that price mix, as it relate to the international pricing that we\u2019re doing, the rest of those about 3 points of negative mix. And that mix was, I\u2019d say two-fold, certainly as we talked about reintroducing additional SKUs. But the other item that we\u2019re seeing is, as we now have wipes\u2019 back end supply, consumers are changing to more convenient forms. So during the height of the pandemic, when we couldn\u2019t supply wipes, it increased our bleach sales in less convenient form. And now that we can produce wipes, consumers are moving back into more convenient form of wipes versus using bleach. Ultimately, that\u2019s good for consumers. It gives them a more preferred solution. But that comes at a slightly lower mix for us. So a combination of the conversion within the product families, as well as introducing additional SKUs, we get to more normalized environment. Stephen Powers : Okay, understood. Thank you very much. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. So, Linda, I wanted to follow-up on your comments on Glad bag. I was hoping, if you can comment on why it\u2019s taking so long to recover even after your main competitor has been narrowing these price gaps and leading in prices increasing, I believe, twice already. Is that because you always laid on innovation and competitors and private-label caught up to it, especially during COVID? And following up on an earlier question, you had committed to keep prices intact during the pandemic, but what do you need to see now that your capacity is back on track and vaccinations are up? Are you still thinking you need to narrow those price gaps in particular for the value proposition in that category, and in particular, in large count bags for Glad trash? And then I have a follow-up question on commodities for Kevin, please. Linda Rendle : Sure. So on Glad, if you look at Q4, just to set the backdrop, sales were down double-digits, but we lapped very strong double-digit growth in Q4 of last year. And we had a 2-year stack of Glad on 9% sales growth, in the fiscal year results, low-single-digits. So overall from a sales perspective, we were happy with where we landed. Really, it\u2019s a sheer disappointment that I continue to have. We want to grow market share and particularly in a category like trash. We are seeing the share trends improving. So we were down about 0.9 points in the latest 52 weeks, down 0.5 points in the latest 13, and down 0.4 in the latest 4 or 5. So definitely trending in the right direction behind improving distribution, getting the fundamentals right, et cetera. When it came to pricing, again, we announced pricing back in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s being implemented now. So \u2013 and we took a larger first round than what we saw in the marketplace to take into account what we saw from the category. And we\u2019re evaluating that again if an additional price increase is warranted. But we feel like we\u2019ve made the right move on Glad. And again, we\u2019ll continue to watch that. Innovation continues to work incredibly well in Glad. And we\u2019re committed to that program moving forward to differentiate our bags. But what we\u2019re really focused on right now is in-market execution, ensuring we have the right distribution at every retailer, implementing pricing flawlessly, and then, getting back to merchandising, which will be important in this category. So, again, this is less of a comment overall in terms of sales, but more around winning in the market, ensuring that we have plans that grow share in the future. Andrea Teixeira : That\u2019s fair, thank you. And the question for Kevin is really like what are your guidance in bags for gross margin? In terms of \u2013 is that fair to say that guidance in bags, while you\u2019re announcing pricing, which is the 50% of the portfolio? And then, in terms of pricing, are you baking in resin to stay as spot or you\u2019re actually using forward curves to basically swap and adapt? Or in other words, if it gets better from here and you take more pricing, there is upside to your guidance. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah, thanks, Andrea, for the question as it relates to how we thought about commodity forecasts. We have projected out what we believe is a commodity environment over the course of the year. So we\u2019re not using a spot rate. And our fundamental assumption is we will see commodity costs continue to increase. In fact, we think this quarter, we\u2019ll see them peak and then begin to moderate in the fall, late calendar year, commodity costs will start to moderate and continue in the back half of the year. And so, this is I think I mentioned on one of the earlier questions, we anticipate about 75% of the commodity cost increases, we\u2019re projecting for the year, we\u2019re going to see in the front half of the year. This is going to be the most extreme comparison period. And just to give you maybe a little bit of additional information to help dimensionalize it, when you think about resin, we\u2019re projecting over 100% increase in the cost of resin in the front half of the year. So that\u2019s the type of environment we\u2019re dealing with. And so that\u2019s a difficult environment to recover that type of margin compression in the time that it\u2019s rising. But we do think we\u2019re positioned well to recover that over time. But right now, we\u2019re projecting for the full year what we think where commodities will land. So any change in that we\u2019ll certainly update you as we learn more. Andrea Teixeira : And if I can squeeze just one question on inventory, the pantry, is there any anecdotal evidence that you\u2019ve heard from your \u2013 basically, your customers saying that \u2013 consumers or even your market studies that consumers have built a lot of inventory on bleach, in particular. To your point already that they\u2019re using bleach to disinfect. And that is super dynamic, or just consumption still remains elevated from your commentary before. It\u2019s just a question of having them switch back to branded as you supply more. Linda Rendle : Yeah, we don\u2019t have any evidence from consumer studies or from retailers that there is excess pantry inventory across any of our categories, where there was pantry loading that happened early in the pandemic, for example, on Glad, those things have already reversed themselves out. And what we\u2019re just seeing is continued elevation of consumption in the cleaning categories as you articulate, but lower than levels at height of the pandemic. But really, we don\u2019t see this as a pantry-loading issue. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you so much, Linda. It\u2019s excellent. Linda Rendle : Great. Thank you. I believe that\u2019s the end of Q&A. Thanks again, everyone, for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you again on our next call in November. And until then, please take good care. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Clorox Company First Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin. Lisah Burhan : Thank you, Michelle. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On the call today with me are Linda Rendle, our CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. I hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. In just a moment, Linda will share a few opening comments, and then we'll take your questions. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, including about our fiscal 2022 outlook and the potential impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our business. These statements are based on management's current expectations but may differ from actual results or outcomes.  In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements and the non-GAAP financial information section, including the tables that reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, both of which are located at the end of today's earnings release, which also has been filed with the SEC. Now I'll turn it over to Linda. Linda Rendle : Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I hope you and your families are well. Hopefully, you found our prepared remarks and this new earnings format helpful. We're off to a solid start to fiscal 2022 with stronger-than-anticipated demand across our portfolio and focused execution in a challenging operating environment. We've made meaningful progress on our strategic priorities this quarter, including restoring supply across much of our portfolio, which has enabled us to hold or gain market share in the vast majority of our businesses. We are proactively addressing the inflationary and cost headwinds that are impacting our margins through pricing and cost reduction initiatives. And at the same time, we're making important investments in our business to strengthen our competitive advantages and position the company for long-term success, including advancing our innovation pipeline, deploying our targeted advertising and sales promotion strategy and investing in critical digital capabilities.  Given our Q1 performance and the actions we are taking, we are reiterating our fiscal '22 outlook. With that, Kevin and I would like to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : So -- and thank you for the new format. Linda, I wanted to touch base on your commentary. I think obviously, it came in better than tiered of your low double digits when you closed the fourth quarter of last year -- of last fiscal year. So I wanted to kind of break down what you think is driven by -- how much you think was driven by the Delta variant coming back? Or how do you see tracking now in the second quarter in terms of demand? And if you can also touch on -- obviously, you put some pricing in place. How do you think pricing can come in? And if you have that price mix impact as mix has been normalized, and then I have a follow-up on the COGS on the cost side. Linda Rendle : Okay. I'll start with the demand piece, and I'll get into pricing and Kevin can talk about mix. So on the demand side, as we articulated back in Q4, we definitely expected it to be bumpy this year as it came to consumer behavior, et cetera. But the good news is this quarter, given our strong position on supply, what we saw as a very successful return to merchandising with our back-to-school program and, of course, Delta impacts, demand was stronger than we anticipated across the vast majority of our portfolio. So that wasn't just in our cleaning businesses, but really across the board.  We generally saw consumer mobility continue to be strong. So we haven't seen as big of an impact as people were in shelter in place before. Delta really didn't have that same impact and yet we did continue to see strong demand as people chose to stay at home more, are self continuing to work from home and are continuing to prioritize health and wellness habits, whether that be cleaning and disinfecting, taking vitamins, minerals and supplements, drinking water. We did see a little bit, Andrea, of timing shifts from Q2 when it comes to merch and a little bit of inventory, but that wasn't the majority of what we saw from an improvement perspective, it really was based consumer demand.  I'll switch to pricing now. As we spoke about in the release, we have announced pricing on 50% of our portfolio. That sell-in continues to go well, and we're seeing execution hit market now in many of the businesses. Given the incremental costs that we're experiencing, we're taking additional action and now pricing a total of 70% of the portfolio this year. And we are beginning to implement many of those as we speak with additional actions that we're taking in the back half to be talked about at that time.  And I would say, generally, given the environment that we're experiencing across the industry, the conversations are very productive. People understand the environment and largely our peers are going as well for our categories are increasing in pricing. But no surprises. Our brands are really strong. At this point, we have the strongest consumer value score that we've ever had since we began measuring it. Our household penetration continues to look strong. Increased repeat rates, increased buy rates. So our brands are healthy. Shares are growing as a result of that, and we feel really well positioned to execute pricing on 70% of the portfolio this year. Kevin Jacobsen : And Andrea -- no, please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Oh, sorry. I wanted to say just on that comment, Linda, thank you for explaining the pricing. So going to the 70%, is that related mostly for the resin or the chlorine that went up recently? So is that applied to mostly bags or that's for the disinfecting franchise? Linda Rendle : 70% of the portfolio is going to encompass a broad range, but it is in relation to 3 things that we're really seeing pressure on. Commodities is one and certainly additional pressure on resin. Hurricane Ida pushed out the resin curve by a month or 2, and so we're seeing a continued impact there. Transportation continues to be a negative driver for us, and we're seeing that continue throughout the remainder of the fiscal year.  And although there hasn't been a big material impact directly, we're looking at labor closely given what we're seeing on pressures there. So we're taking all of that into account. We have not announced since you asked the question directly, an additional price increase on Glad. We've executed high single digits at this point, but we are evaluating an additional price increase on Glad given what we're seeing in resin. And that's been -- we long follow what happens in resin and are able to move pretty quickly on Glad. And that's something that we're contemplating as another price increase on Glad, in addition to what I talked about in the 70%. Kevin Jacobsen : And then, Andrea, you had asked a question about price mix, and maybe just a little background and I talked about this in August. We benefited from about 3 to 4 points of favorable price mix through the pandemic, and we know that was temporary primarily driven by the rationalization of our product offerings. If you recall, to increase supply availability, we produced a lot less products. They tend to be smaller single accounts. And additionally, because of lack of merchandising activity because of the lack of supply, we were generating favorable price mix for about 4 straight quarters, pretty consistently about 3- to 4-point capability.  We fully expect that to unwind as we get back to a more normalized level of supply and we get back to a more normalized level of promotional activity. That started in the fourth quarter. We had about 2 points of unfavorable price mix. It continued this quarter. We had 3 points of unfavorable price mix. I'd expect to see that for 2 more quarters. So we'll see it in the second quarter, third quarter. And then by the fourth quarter, I would expect to have lapped this temporary benefit. And you also see the full benefit of the pricing actions we're taking. So by the fourth quarter, I'd expect us to return to favorable price mix. And as you probably saw in our prepared remarks. We continue to expect by the back half of the year, we're going to get our sales back into the low end of our long-term sales goal, 3% to 5%. Part of that will be driven by the fact that we'll start generating positive price mix as well in the back half of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Grom of UBS. Peter Grom : So I was just kind of hoping to get your updated view on margin progression from here. Clearly, the first quarter came in slightly better than you had anticipated from at least from a gross margin perspective, and you're expecting sequential improvement. But is there any way to help us maybe quantify that sequential improvement from here as pricing builds? And how much expansion you actually expect in the fourth quarter? I mean, I guess what I'm really trying to get at is how should we really think about the margin recovery, and frankly, how quickly can we get back to the mid-40% range? Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. Thanks, Peter, for the question. And let me give you my perspective on how we see margin phasing out this year. As you recall, back in August, our expectation was that Q1 was going to be our most difficult quarter from a cost input perspective. And then we see sequential improvement in margin throughout the year. And importantly, by the fourth quarter, returning to gross margin expansion, and we identify getting back in the low 40s. What has changed since that time are 2 things, and Linda mentioned them. We have revised our expectation on cost inputs. We originally had assumed about $300 million worth of cost inputs on commodities and transportation. We have raised that expectation now at about $350 million. As part of that, we now think we will see peak cost inputs in the second quarter versus the first quarter. That's primarily driven by resin. We have shifted out our expectations about 2 months as a result of Hurricane Ida in terms of when we'll see peak resin, so we'll see that in the second quarter.  As a result of that, I would expect this to be our most difficult quarter from a cost input perspective. I would expect our margins to be in the mid-30s. And then I expect when we get to the back half of the year, based on the incremental actions we're taking, both on pricing and cost management, we'll see sequential improvements as we move through our Q3 and Q4. And we still expect to get to a point of gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter, and we still expect to be in the low 40s. Peter Grom : Okay. Great. So mid-30s that means that to get to the 300 to 400 basis points for the year, I mean, that would imply some pretty substantial gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter. Is that right? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, it would. Now keep in mind that this is based on the assumptions we have for the cost inputs. And as you know, that's been difficult to predict. Our assumptions are resin is one of the assumptions. We continue to assume we're going to see resin prices moderate in the back half of the year. When we talked back in August, we assume we'd see resin peak in this calendar year and then start to moderate. We still hold that same expectation. All we've done is push out that peak a couple of months this calendar year. And so that's an important assumption for us that resin prices start to go down in the back half of the year. But assuming it plays out like we expect, yes, we expect to see some material margin improvements in the back half of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Stephen Robert Powers : Just -- maybe just an overarching question. I think you laid out pretty clearly a better expected start, good elasticities, more pricing on to come but at the same time, the higher cost that you're contending with across many lines of the P&L. So I guess just for my frame of reference, how do those net out? If your prior outlook was down the middle of your guide, are you now at all biased higher or lower? Or are we still kind of down the middle of your guide with the 1 quarter under your belt? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, Steve, maybe I'll give you a perspective on both sales and margin and profit. If I start with the top line, to your point, we did come in better than our expectations. We thought we were going to be down low double digits for Q1. You obviously saw our results are sort of more mid-single digits. Now some of that, we think, is timing, as Linda mentioned. If you look at our performance through the quarter and primarily as a result of Delta, we saw the business really pick up in the second half of the quarter, and that continued through September. So I think we'll see a little bit of that move between quarters now as there's a little bit of retail and consumer inventory that we worked through. But I don't think that will have any impact on the full year, but you'll see a little bit of timing shifts between quarters. For us, when we talked in August, we thought the front half would be down high single -- excuse me, low double digits to high single digits. We now think the front half will be down high single digits. So we expect a little bit better performance in the front half of the year on the top line.  And what I'd say, Steve, is I just think it's a little too early to be making any changes to our outlook. We're pleased with the start to the year. We're still only 1 quarter into the year. As you know, there's quite a few things that are outside of our control that we want to see how they play out and they've been fairly volatile. And so I like the start. We've got a fairly wide range. I think that's appropriate on the top line for now. I want to get into cold and flu, see how that plays out and I want to see how the pandemic plays out before we make any changes.  As it relates to margin and profit, we did come in a little bit better. But as you said, we see that there's a -- there's more cost headwinds than we initially anticipated, about $50 million. We are taking actions between incremental pricing actions as well as increased cost savings that we think we can offset that. And so that will delay the benefits a little bit to the back half of the year. But we still believe we're on track for both our outlook and our EPS range. And again, I think it's just too early to be guiding to higher low ends or changing those outlooks. I like the start of the year. I like our plans for the balance of the year. And I really like the things we can control. But I also recognize there's a number of areas we don't control, and I want to see how those play out over the next quarter or 2. Stephen Robert Powers : Okay. Great. And I guess maybe a follow-up on just the resin outlook that you just mentioned earlier. I guess I was a little surprised to see you hold to continued expectation of resins and commodities moderating. I'm not saying it's wrong. I mean who knows. Just that it's less conservative than what we've seen from others so far.  So I guess maybe can you -- I get 2 questions really to that. Can you give us a sense of the margin of profitability at risk if prices remain close to where they are today than what you're assuming? Is that -- can you stay within your range in that scenario? Is it pushing you to the bottom or below the bottom end of the range, that kind of thing? And then as I think about the step up -- the implied step up sequentially between margin and the gross margin in the mid-30s in 2Q and then presumably back up above 40 in 3Q, if my quick math is right, what are the drivers there? How much of that is resin moderating? How much of that is the pricing coming in? How much of that is the top line coming back stronger? Just give us a sense for how that step-up occurs sequentially. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure, Steve. I'd say the profit risk, it's hard to tell exactly what's at risk based on resin because, again, we would take actions. If the resin forecast does not play out like we expect, then we revisit our pricing plans across our portfolio to offset some portion of that. And so it's difficult to put an exact number on if resin doesn't play out to our plan.  What I would tell you, though, in terms of our resin forecast, as you can imagine, we leverage outside experts on this as well. And this is generally in line with what we're seeing from the outside experts. So it doesn't feel like it's an off-market expectation that we'll see resin prices moderate in the back half of the year. And then a sequential step-up, as you think about what's going to drive that sequential step up in the back half of the year. The first one is commodities. We think this is going to be the most challenging quarter we have from a commodity cost input. If you look at Q1, there's about 550 basis points of headwinds on commodities. I expect Q2 is going to be closer to 600 basis points as we pushed out the resin decline a couple of months. And then you'll see commodities start to drop in the back half of the year. So you'll see some pick up there.  In addition to commodity, input costs starting to moderate. We'll start to see the full benefit of our pricing actions. It's really just in Q2, we're getting the bulk of our price increases in place. And as we talked about, we're pricing an additional 20% of our portfolio, that will be in the back half of the year. And you'll see the benefit of pricing start to step up. You also see the benefit of our cost savings program ramp up in the back half of the year. So that will create additional benefits. And then finally, on manufacturing and logistics. As I think you folks know, we've talked about this quite a bit. We're incurring quite a bit of additional cost as we build more resiliency into our supply chain. We've increased the number of third-party manufacturers we work with. That's true with raw and packaging material suppliers as well. As demand moderates and we'll be able to take more of that production back in-house, we'll be able to step out of these relationships. That will start in the back half of the year. Now that's probably a 12- to 18-month journey to step out these charges, but you'll start to see us do that in the back half of the year if demand moderates to the extent we expect it will. And those will be the key drivers that will support margin improvements in the back half of the year. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Filippo Falorni : This is Filippo Falorni on for Nik. I want to go back to pricing. You mentioned, obviously, the 70% where you're taking pricing, and you mentioned in the release that elasticities have improved so far. Can you discuss what you're assuming in terms of demand elasticity once you're getting to the 70% of the portfolio with price increases, and also whether you're thinking that private label would also follow? Most of your branded competitors clearly are following on price increases, but also what about on the private label side, and what you're thinking about the price gap relative to private label. Linda Rendle : Sure. Yes. So as we spoke about and you mentioned we're taking pricing on 70% of the portfolio, and elasticities across our portfolio have improved in this period. And that gives us additional confidence in our ability to take price and, of course, what we believe will be the consumer reaction in that price increase. As you also mentioned, we are seeing branded competitors move, and we're generally seeing price gaps in our categories aligned to what they were before pricing action took place. So nothing seems to be out of line. And we're also seeing private label pass-through pricing at this point as well. And so price gaps as it relates to store brand are also maintaining.  If we kind of just take a step back, it's one of the reasons why it's so important for us to continue to invest in our brands as we go through this period. That's why we continue to lean into advertising spending, why we've kept up on our innovation program. And that's really helping us as we sell through, one, support the consumer as they go through this pricing change but also support us from a retail execution standpoint because there are other ways that we can help grow the category in addition to pricing.  So again, all on track. I would say elasticities will help us. But we've built that into the outlook that we've had. The assumed elasticities on that improvement is already built in, and we'll just continue to monitor it. But no surprises at this point in terms of category, other people following and what we're seeing from a price gap perspective. Filippo Falorni : Great. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up on -- you mentioned investing in the brands. And considering the difficult supply chain environment that you're facing and every consumer product company is facing, how do you balance the investment, particularly on the innovation front as well as kind of maintaining core supplies on your core products to make sure you have enough inventory levels and you're building inventory levels. If you can talk about managing both the innovation and the core brands, that would be helpful. Linda Rendle : Sure. I think first, getting to your point on supply, the good news is we're back in a position across our core brands and innovation that we can supply. So about 5% of our portfolio is on allocation at this point. So we're able to meet consumer demand across the vast majority of our portfolio. And that bodes well for getting distribution back on our core brands, which we purposely narrowed during that pandemic period, but we're beginning to expand that again, and that's going well.  And really, when we think about advertising, we are an ROI-based advertiser. We  belong in the -- believe in the long term, and we believe in building brands, but we're also very carefully managing how we spend that dollar. So we know in the return we get on investing in innovation, the return that we get on investing in the base. And the team is always optimizing that over time. That has led to very strong ROI improvements on our advertising over time using that model. And even though we put significantly more money in and spent about 11% of sales last year, and we plan to spend 10% of sales this year, we've continued to see that ROI go up.  And what we've really been focused on is getting much more out of our digital advertising. And as part of our IGNITE Strategy, we had talked about wanting to get to know about 100 million consumers in the U.S., and that allows us to further drive efficiencies in our digital spending and effectiveness. And that is well on its way. We are halfway to that goal and that has really helped us with the ROI.  So again, it is really about thinking about the long term on the brands. We balance the spending within the brands based off of an ROI model, and we're always able to adjust as we learn more, but it is about building those brands over time and ensuring that we have superior value with consumers. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Christopher Carey : I just -- I know it's been asked in different ways, but maybe just to tie it up. If the forward rates on resins don't play out and say current rates do, you're announcing expansion of pricing going into the market. Productivity sounds like a lever, and you have some other levers at your disposal as well. What's your preference or flexibility to offset the cost environment if it takes another step up? Or said another way, the forwards don't play out, can you expand pricing to more of the portfolio? Do you increase the rate of pricing? You noted that on a slide you're looking at doing just that. Maybe some perspective on -- should that environment not play out as you expect, what's the -- what are kind of the tools in your arsenal? Linda Rendle : Sure, Chris. Thanks for the question. I think as Kevin highlighted, we do have an increased expectation on the cost environment, and then we've taken the appropriate actions through pricing and cost reductions to deal with that. And that's exactly what we would do is we would see that resin curve continue to be pushed out. We would evaluate both the rates and the degree of pricing across the portfolio. And frankly, we have all of that ready now. We've been evaluating that and would be ready to go if additional increases were warranted. We'd, of course, want to balance that to ensure that we don't get out of whack with price gaps and to ensure that we continue to support our innovation, et cetera. And then, of course, we're always looking for ways to reduce costs, and we would continue to put focus there through everything that we possibly can do. So know that, that's what we are thinking about. We have contingency plans in the event that, that happens, but we'll be balancing all of that if we were to have to take additional actions at that curve were to be pushed out further. Christopher Carey : Okay. Okay, got it. And then if I could just -- one more on -- I think you kind of mentioned this a number of times that you're taking a balanced approach to the top line. It sounds like you think you have some flexibility there, specifically to the back half, but a lot can play out. But I guess if I'm thinking about this, your mix is improving. You're not seeing a lot of volume elasticity. If anything, it sounds like you feel pretty good about volumes. Pricing is going to be building into the back half of the year. And I guess if you put all that together, why would you expect to only be at the low end of your long-term target? I guess is question one.  And then secondly, does that have to do with timing of when the pricing comes into the market? Maybe it's more Q4 weighted. So just any perspective around that? And if it's just ever early, then I suppose that's reasonable. But I just want to make sure I'm not missing something there. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, Chris, I would say on our sales outlook for the year, the minus 2% to minus 6%, we think that's a balanced view where we sit today. And you mentioned it, it is still very early in the year. We're only 1 quarter in. And keep in mind, the 2 biggest items that can impact our results that are outside of our control are both how cold and flu season plays out as well as how the pandemic plays out. And so I think it's much too early to start changing our outlook.  As we said, we're pleased with the start to the year relative to our expectations. But we also know there's a number of items that we don't directly control that will impact our results. And so we'd like to get another quarter or so into the year and see how those are playing out. And then we'll truly come back and update you if we have a different perspective. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : A couple of quick questions. So back to the expectation of commodity released in the second half of the year, I think I also heard Linda mentioned that you guys plan to kind of enact more price increases in the back half of the year. So my question is, what's the risk that retailers begin to push back? If you kind of hold out and wait to push the next round through until commodities are actually already rescinding, isn't there a higher risk that they won't actually be enacted, utilities are going to push back? Lisah Burhan : Jason, so when we're talking about back half increases, many of which go into discussions at the beginning of our back half. We're continuing to see that cost environment ramp up. And I don't think anybody is thinking that this is going to abate or to be to a place where people are starting to think about we're in a full recovery. So I don't anticipate the back half being an issue. I think retailers will appreciate the fact that we're taking a very disciplined approach to this, and continue to partner with them to ensure that we're doing the right things for the categories. And I wouldn't anticipate there being a different environment in the back half given what we're seeing from a cost perspective.  Of course, we're being very thoughtful about that. We're building that into the consideration as we plan when we will announce pricing. But we are doing that knowing full well how our categories behave, consumer trends, key merchandising periods, et cetera. And I would say, given the fact that we continue to invest, and we're bringing retailers really strong innovation plans, they have still been a mode of partnership and continuing to build plans with us to build the categories. Jason English : Got it. That makes sense. And you mentioned the -- I guess, 2 more questions kind of drilling in on gross margin. First, the manufacturing expenses you referred to sort of the unusual ones that you thought would fall away over time. Can you give us any quantification of how big that is? And then secondly, in terms of cost savings, it's only 1 quarter, but it was a pretty small quarter in terms of cost savings contribution. What are you expecting for the full year on that line? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. Jason, on cost savings, I'd expect cost savings to probably be more robust than we've seen in previous years. As you know, we're leaning into that as one way to help us address the cost environment. It was a little bit lower in Q1. I expect that to ramp up as we move through the year. So you should expect to see greater value as we go through the year and execute some of the additional cost savings actions we're pursuing.  On the manufacturing up charges, we haven't broken that out specifically. But I can tell you there's a reasonable amount of money that we're incurring as we're leveraging third-party manufacturers and suppliers. I think I've mentioned to you in the past, historically, we have self-manufactured about 80% of our shipments, and we go to contract manufacturers for the remaining 20%. During this pandemic, that mix is more 50-50 right now. So we're relying on contract manufacturers to a much better degree to help us keep up with demand. As demand moderates, we'll be able to pull that back into our facilities and unwind some of these agreements we have in place. And there are some nice savings associated with that. And so you'll see that play out through our P&L.  As I mentioned, we'll have to see how demand plays out with the pandemic. I believe, certainly over the -- starting in the back half of this year and over the next 12 to maybe 24 months, we'll be able to step out of those charges. But we'll get started, I think, in the back half doing that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : I'm glad, I'm next. I want to follow up on, Kevin, on your answer to Jason on producing a larger percentage of your portfolio. Can you maybe talk about how we should be thinking about what the spread is in terms of the margins of self-manufactured versus third party? And then how long should we be thinking about or -- what's the timing in being able to get back to that 80% range? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. Thanks for the question. I'd tell you it's interesting. It goes beyond just what you'd call the co-pack profit margin, which could be up from 10% to 20% depending on the co-packer. We've had to extend our supply chain not just through contract manufacturers, but we've done that through raw and packaging material suppliers. It's becoming a much more global supply chain to build in the resiliency we need to manage through the disruptions of this environment. So not only do you have the profit margin or the profit up charge from these folks, but you've got an extended supply chain, which means increased transportation as well as we have to bring product in from further distances. You also have increased warehousing because we're holding more inventory on hand to manage through the disruption. So there is a level of cost that's built up in our supply chain. This part of the resiliency we've built in to ensure that we can supply product we will work, I suspect, over the next 12 to 24 months to be able to pull those costs out of our system. Now a lot of that will be driven on how the demand plays out. We assume demand will moderate. Keep in mind, our demand was plus 20% during the pandemic. We think long term is 3% to 5%. As that demand moderates, we'll be able to start pulling costs out of our supply chain, and that will happen over time.  I'll just -- I'll give you one example of how this played out, and this has happened last quarter. When we had Hurricane Ida, our largest resin provider in the Gulf region went offline for about 2 months and declared a force majeure. But because of the great work our product supply team did, we had increased resin inventory on hand. We had alternative suppliers qualified, and we did not miss a beat from a production perspective. And we were able to keep shipping product to our customers in spite of our largest provider going offline for the better part of the quarter. We've had to do that across our entire portfolio, and we recognize that comes with a cost, and that's the cost we're going to be able to go after, which is another reason that gives us confidence we can rebuild margins over time beyond the commodity environment improving. We know we can step out of these charges. And as I said, I think that's a year or 2 process for us to do that. Kaumil Gajrawala : Okay. Got it. And if I could just ask about mix. You were pretty clear in your comments and in the release that now you have value packs, multi-packs, all these things are kind of coming back. In your kind of 2 to 6, have you provided how much of the drag mix will be over the course of the full year? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. In terms of the course of the full year on the top line, as I said, we had about a 3- to 4-point benefit from price mix due to this temporary benefit of less merchandising activity and a lower level of assortment we were offering. That will be reversed out. And so I'd expect 3 to 4 points of unfavorable price mix. It started in Q4. It continued in Q1, expected for 2 more quarters. By the fourth quarter, we've lapped it. And we've also got the benefit of pricing. So I'd expect favorable price mix by the time we get to the fourth quarter. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : A couple of questions. So first thing I wanted to ask about was cash flow. You've called it out in the release, and it was $48 million quite low this quarter. There was a mention of higher inventory, but it still seems pretty dramatic. So I'd just love a little bit more color on that, if possible. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure, Lauren. You're exactly right. In terms of cash flow, we delivered $41 million. It was down 89%. Typically, if you look at the cash we generate, it's fairly consistent across the quarters. A little bit of a dip in Q2 because of some seasonality in our Kingsford business. But historically, we generate our cash pretty consistently across the quarters. It's going to look very different this year. In the front half, it's going to be depressed because of the reduction in net earnings. Keep in mind, we're lapping about 50%, 60% growth in net earnings last year. So earnings are down more materially in the front half of the year. That will reduce the cash we generate. And then I expect that to pick up pretty significantly in the back half of the year. In total, before the pandemic, we were generating somewhere between $900 million and $1 billion of cash on an annual basis. I think we'll be a little bit lower this year, expected to be in the $850 million to $950 million range primarily driven because the increased costs will depress our earnings a bit this year. And so it will be a little bit below our normal run rate in terms of cash we generate, and then I expect that to rebound as we move into fiscal year '23. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Great. And it was just -- the other thing with that is the cash flow this quarter, though, was a lot lower than it was in a normal pre-COVID first quarter. So that wasn't the reason I was asking the question beyond the earnings decline. Is there anything else just, again, because we don't have the visibility yet into the cash flow statement that's worth calling out in terms of this quarter in particular a sequential performance that we should be thinking about? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. I would I'd probably note 2 items. There was some timing on receivables and payables. And one example, I mentioned earlier, we saw a really strong performance later in the quarter as a result of the Delta variant. We had a pretty strong month of September. And what that means is our AR balance was higher than we had anticipated. That's just timing related. We've already collected those receivables by now. But just based on the cutoff, we carried some extra AR going into the end of the quarter.  And then inventory levels, as I've talked about, we have raised inventory levels as part of the work we're doing to ensure supply. And so those will be elevated for a while, and we'll start working that down over time. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Great. And then on the timing elements that you had just called out because -- on particular categories, just anything that might be worth noting. I don't typically think of your categories as ones that see a lot of retailer inventory build ahead of a price increase. So I'm assuming this is just more about, I guess, retailer concerns about the degree of which Delta was going to persist and your expectations that works through. So sequentially, we should be thinking about sales decelerating. I mean your full year guidance is very clear. I just wanted to get a sense for the 1Q, 2Q dynamic. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. Lauren, as it relates to Q1, Q2 on sales, as you recall, last quarter, we thought we'd be down low single digits in Q1 and then low -- excuse me, low double digits in Q1 and then high single digits. We've improved our front half forecast. We now think the whole front half will be down high single digits. That's a little bit better than what we thought back in August. There's just a little bit of timing that will probably move between quarters. As I said, we probably got a little bit of extra retail inventory, a little bit of extra consumer inventory based on the timing of the shipments. I think that will play out between the quarters. And we continue to expect the front half of the year to be down high single digits. And so I think it will look that much different than what we saw in Q1. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Great. And then just one more question to -- I know everyone's been asking about resin and gross margin. But I was just curious, you hadn't mentioned chlorine. I think it was asked about earlier in a question, but I think there's been a pretty sizable move in chlorine since August. And just any other color on labor and logistics and how you're thinking about that into your forecast with things improving in the back half of your year. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. As it relates to commodities, as you know, back in August, we knew this is going to be a tough year, and we had anticipated about $300 million worth of cost increases, which is pretty significant for us. In a typical year, we might see $50 million, maybe $60 million of cost increases. So we knew there's going to be a tough year on substrate, on soybean oil, on resin, and that was baked into our outlook back in August.  What has changed for us based on our initial assumption is really resin has gotten worse. We think the peak resin price will push out, as we said, a couple of months. But by and large, we think we have gotten the commodity environment mostly right. Resin is the only one we're updating. And then transportation is the other one. I had assumed that we'd start to see transportation rates come down in the back half of the year. And what we think now is this imbalance in supply and demand we're seeing in that market is going to continue for all of fiscal year '22. And so that's the other change we're making. And those are really the 2 changes versus what we talked about in August. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : A couple of clean-up questions for me on pricing because I know we've covered a lot of ground at this point. So you indicated intentions to price on 70% of the portfolio. I think that's clear. And I apologize if I missed this. Can you just comment on the remaining 30% where, at the moment, you currently do not intend to take price just given the pressure on gross margin? It would certainly seem like across the board, there's a cost justification for that. Perhaps you can just comment on it. And then on the elasticity, the second question, Linda, your elasticities have been better than expected. This is broadly held true across the CPG and it sounds like you expect that improvement to hold. Maybe just spend a moment on that. Talk about that a bit and why you do not expect to see any sort of mean reversion to historical elasticities. Linda Rendle : Sure. I'll start on the pricing question, Kevin. So on the 30% we're choosing to not price at the moment, we're evaluating category by category, what the cost increases are. We're looking at commodity and cost justification. And there are some of our categories that have not been as impacted that are not as driven by resin and certainly might be impacted by transportation but to a lesser degree, and there's other choices that we can make. And as we've talked about, we're taking a look across the entire P&L to see where we can reduce costs. And so nobody is excluded from that. None of the businesses are excluded from that.  But as it relates to pricing, we're really looking at it category by category, looking at the cost impact and what we think will happen from a consumer standpoint and making that choice. That doesn't mean, though, of course, as we continue to navigate throughout the year, if we were to have additional pressures that we wouldn't consider pricing that additional 30%. But at this point, we think it's the best mix not to. And then elasticities, I think it is true that consumers have turned to branded solutions during this pandemic. They want trusted solutions, and they certainly turned to our portfolio. And we've spoken about the numerous ways our portfolio has gotten stronger during this time, whether that be household penetration. Again, stronger retention in buy rates, higher repeat rates. And what we deem as the best consumer value we've seen since measuring it with 70% of our portfolio deemed superior by consumers. That has translated into stronger elasticities.  That doesn't mean though there is an elasticity impact, and I just want to make sure that's clear. They've improved, but we certainly do expect a volume impact to taking pricing. It's just with a lesser degree that we would have seen prepandemic. And we're watching that closely. And the reason, again, that we continue to invest to keep those elasticities holding as people move through. And just the one caveat I would continue to warn. Consumer behavior has been very difficult to predict during this pandemic. All the fundamentals look good right now, but we'll continue to see, as Kevin has articulated what happens in cold and flu, what happens through the course of the remainder of the pandemic. But at this point, we feel very confident that our brands are strong. We can take this pricing, and if that's -- those lower elasticities will hold. Kevin Grundy : Got it. And just a quick clarification. Do you care to comment on which categories you do not -- at this point in time, I'm looking at the Nielsen data, and it would certainly not appear to be the case in salad dressing or charcoal. Are those the 2 categories primarily at this point? Or you do not care to comment? Linda Rendle : No comment yet, Kevin. I hope you can understand we're working through this live right now. And so as we have all of these price increases implemented, then we can talk more about the details of the categories. But I would just say, as you watch the data, I know that pricing will be rolling through this quarter and in the back half as well. And so you'll be seeing that flow through across a number of our categories coming up here quickly. Operator : Next question is from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser with D.A. Davidson. Linda Bolton-Weiser: Yes. The international business performed a little bit better than we expected on the sales line. Can you talk about whether you think the international markets are still experiencing some benefit from the pandemic or not? Linda Rendle : Yes. The international, if you look at the 2-year stack for that business, this quarter was up 19%, so it continues to perform very well. I mean we saw a double-digit growth in a number of our businesses, including our wipes business, Burt's Bees, Cat Litter, and mid-single-digit growth in another of our large businesses, including Glad and Brita. So I feel, overall, very good about international.  Depending on the market, we're seeing significant pricing pass-through in some of markets which -- so we're taking double-digit pricing in places in international, and that's gone well to date. But we're really leaning into those growth levers we have in international. I would say depending on the market is -- to the degree which the pandemic is impacting that, and you can appreciate, given we compete in over 100 markets, it's very different by market. But generally, we're seeing cleaning behaviors continue to persist across the globe where people are cleaning more and more concerned about their health and wellness. And we're taking advantage of that across our portfolio to deliver innovation, to continuing to invest in our brands and expand our distribution. So I think to your point, international did perform well. We do have some tough comps coming up here again in Q2. But we have strong plans, and our brands are growing share in the markets that we compete in. Linda Bolton-Weiser: And can I just ask one more about -- I know there were a couple of questions about the cadence of sales for first quarter and second quarter. And I'm not sure I'm understanding why you would expect overall sales decline to get bigger in the second quarter. The POS data actually seems to indicate only a modest decline in October, what we're seeing in the data. So can you just give one more -- say one more time why you expect the sales decline to be bigger in the second quarter. Kevin Jacobsen : Linda, what I'd say on the second quarter compared to the first quarter, a few things for you to think about. As we've said, we think our sales will be down high single digits in the front half of the year. So hopefully, that helps you think about the second quarter. We're lapping 27% growth again in Q2, which is what we had to lap in Q1. And also, as we mentioned, we think there's a little bit of shift of timing between Q1 and Q2. So we had very strong shipments late in Q1. We think some of that's created some additional inventory with both retailers and consumers that get worked out in the second quarter.  So I think when you consider all those items, you get to down high single digits in the front half which will put a little bit more pressure on Q2 as you have some shifting between quarters. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms.  Rendle, I will now like to turn the program back to you. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Michelle. Thanks again, everyone. I look forward to speaking to you again on our next call in February. Until then, please stay well. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Clorox Company Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. Lisah Burhan : Thanks, Michelle. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Linda Rendle, our CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. I hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. In addition, we've posted a transcript of the pre-recorded remarks. In just a moment, Linda will share a few opening comments, and then we'll take your questions. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements about our fiscal year 2022 outlook and the potential impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our business. These statements are based on management's current expectations but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identify various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements and the non-GAAP financial information section, including the tables that reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, both of which are located at the end of today's earnings release, which has also been filed with the SEC. Now I'll turn it over to Linda. Linda Rendle : Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I hope you and your families are well. Hopefully, you found our prepared remarks helpful. We faced significant cost headwinds in a volatile operating environment in Q2, but despite these challenging conditions, we executed well on those factors under our control. This includes taking strategic pricing actions and driving cost savings, while restoring supply, serving our customers and advancing our consumer-centric innovation pipeline. Demand remains robust across our portfolio, and our brand superiority results are better than during the height of the pandemic. We have a portfolio of strong, trusted brands exposed to demand-driven tailwinds, and we will continue to invest in them, which we expect will fuel long-term growth for our business. While we anticipate this highly dynamic and challenging environment to persist over the near term and adjusted our fiscal 2022 outlook as a result, we are confident that we're taking the appropriate actions to navigate this period, deliver profitable growth over time and build a stronger, more resilient company. With that, Kevin and I will open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Rendle. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : So a couple of questions on gross margins. Just given the magnitude of declines now expected this year, can you discuss conceptually how long do you think it takes to try to recover these cost pressures from a pricing standpoint? Originally, it sounds like you're hoping to make a lot of progress next year, at least based on the exit rate in Q4. But you run the arithmetic now and it require -- it would require a mid-teens corporate price increase, even if you assume no demand elasticity just to recover this year's gross margin compression. So clearly, not realistic to take that much pricing in 1 year.  So just any thoughts on how long it might take to try to recover the gross margin pressure? Is it a multiyear endeavor? And how do you think about pricing offset relative to potential impact on share? And then second, just any thoughts around if there's an ability maybe to more aggressively consider your SG&A structure and more aggressively consider ways to lower your fixed cost base just in light of what now appears to be a structurally different cost level in terms of commodities and other cost factors? Kevin Jacobsen : Dara, this is Kevin. I appreciate the question. Let me start with the expectations for gross margin. And I'm sure, as you can appreciate, I won't provide a specific outlook beyond this year. But I can give you some perspective in terms of what we're seeing. And if you look at the work we're doing, we believe we're taking the right actions primarily through our pricing efforts and our cost savings program that we continue to be in a position that we can recover costs and rebuild margins over time. Now I do think that's going to take some time given the level of inflation we're dealing with. And I think you're hearing from us and a lot of peers. This is a unique environment with an extreme level of cost inflation. But we do think we've got the right plans in place to be able to rebuild margins. Now for us, that continue -- we continue to believe that's going to start this year. We think by the fourth quarter, we're in a position when we start that process of rebuilding margins and then fully expect that to continue next year. If I look at our history, this is the fourth inflationary cycle we've gone through in the last 10 years. If you look at the 3 previous times we've done this, we've been able to fully price and drive our cost savings program to offset the cost inflation, rebuild margins. It historically has taken us about 12 to 18 months to do that. I would tell you though in this case, because of the extreme level of inflation we're dealing with, I expect it to take longer. So we'll have to see exactly how that plays out. And what will also influence the timing, to a certain extent, is how the inflationary market plays out. That could either extend the time line or accelerate if we get any tailwinds or further headwinds on cost inflation. But I do think it's going to take several years for us to rebuild margin. And what's important for us is while we are committed to rebuilding margins, at the same time, we want to make sure we continue to invest in the business to maintain the top line momentum. We have very good momentum on the top line. As you know, we're expecting 3% to 5% going forward. And we want to continue to invest to maintain that momentum. So we think the way we maximize the value of this company is we invest to maintain that momentum. And then at the appropriate price -- pace, we rebuild margins, which we're committed to doing. And then in regard to fixed costs and choices we can make. One thing I'd tell you, and we've talked about this a little bit in the past. As you know, we have significantly extended our supply chain through this pandemic, both to increase supply availability as well as to be able to increase our ability to meet this elevated demand. That is an opportunity for us. And so as demand continues to moderate, we're going to be able to go after those fixed costs in our supply chain and take those out. And that's another reason that gives us confidence that we're going to be able to rebuild margins. Dara Mohsenian : Great. And then any opportunities from an SG&A standpoint you're looking at given the higher commodity levels here in terms of leverage you can perhaps pull on to have greater cost savings and offset some of this gross margin pressure as you look out? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, we're going to continue to drive our admin productivity program. We've been doing that for years, and we'll continue to rely on that to help offset the cost inflation. We're on track to have another very good year from a cost savings perspective, and you'll see both benefits to cost of goods, but we also drive admin productivity, and you'll see us continue to do that going forward. But that will certainly be a key component of our work as we go. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : I hope all of you are well. Are there some take-or-pay third-party contracts that you will anniversary and potentially online already this calendar year? Or there is more like a consideration in calendar 2023? I think, Kevin, you alluded to that supply and supply chain consideration just now to -- in response to Dara's question. Or is that something that you still want to keep that cushion of supply even now with more capacity and demand have normalized? And on the amount of inflation, just as a follow-up, that you're calling now, we are hearing a lot of the peers saying that because it's broad-based and it's mostly logistics and transportation, that could represent even more than half of the pressure? While the other commodities revenues and which they have peeked and have improved. But -- is that something that you're seeing more secular now? And therefore, it might take those 12 to 18 months that you called out, is that the way we should be thinking? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, Andrea, thanks for the question. As it relates to take-or-pay agreements and as we've talked about this in the past, because of the tremendous increase in demand for our products, we quickly started expanding our supplier base, including the use of third-party manufacturers so we get more product out to meet demand. That came at a higher cost, but we thought that was a smart choice to make because we did not want to overinvest in our capacity. And then as demand moderated, we'd end up over capacitized and underutilizing our facilities.  And so we made that decision. We have increased the number of third-party manufacturers we work with. As demand moderates, as we expect it would, we are going to start stepping out of those agreements. I would expect that to start this fiscal year. In the back half of the year, we'll start stepping out in some of these agreements. And then the pace as we go will really be driven by consumer demand. As we watch demand play out, we will pull back on the capacity we've built up over time to match that demand moderation. But everything we're looking at suggests will start this year. And I think how you'll see that play out in our performance is what will start is you'll start to see our inventory levels come down. Because we've increased the number of manufacturing nodes we have in the network, that just means we're holding higher inventory levels as we have inventory in all these different facilities.  So I think by the end of the year, you'll start to see our inventory levels come down. And then I would think in fiscal year '23, you'll start seeing the real benefit of bringing that production back in-house, utilizing our facilities rather than these third-party manufacturers. And then on inflation, very similar to what you've heard from our peers, we are seeing inflation broadly across all the inputs within the supply chain. We're calling out commodities and transportation because, by far, that's the biggest amount of inflation we're dealing with. For us, commodity is still about 2/3 of the inflation, about 1/3 transportation, and resin, obviously, is the biggest component of the commodity inflation. And then on transportation for us, I think your question was, is it structural or not. Where we're seeing it, we're seeing it really in 2 areas. One, we're clearly seeing higher rates broadly across the transportation market. But the other challenge we're seeing is our use of spot carriers. As we see elevated demand for trucks and driver shortage is continuing, it's forcing us to move to the spot market at a greater pace than we've done historically. And we're seeing the premiums of spot market continue to increase. They're running 50% to 75% higher than primary carriers.  I think over time, if you assume demand for goods moderates over time, you're going to see us be able to move away from those spot carriers back to our primary carriers, and that should significantly reduce our transportation costs. And so while there will be inflation in the market, it is a significant upcharge for us using these spot carriers. And that ability to move back will be a nice savings for us over time. And I would expect to see that as demand settles out. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Chris Carey : I guess I'm trying to understand just a little bit better. I hear you on the outlook for gross margins for the full year. I guess I'm just trying to understand maybe like the moving pieces for the back half. I guess if I look at this quarter, productivity still coming in a bit light, pricing is going to be building, raw materials probably weren't materially worse than what you thought this quarter and manufacturing and logistics definitely worse, and operating deleverage probably worse sequentially worse, too. And I guess, to really get comfortable with how negative gross margins are going to be in the back half, I suppose you have to assume that productivity remains fairly muted, that raw materials obviously remain negative as you just said. But you're also dealing with some pretty significant operating deleverage and maybe that's a nod to the fixed cost base, I'm not sure. But I guess is that -- is the way to think about that bridge kind of fair? And then maybe -- and sorry for the long question, but just as far as mix goes, obviously, mix normalizing is a big part of the story this year, as pricing is building, you're going to be pricing on 85% of the portfolio now? And so how does that factor in here? I guess what I'm getting at is just -- I hear you have the gross margin pressure, but you have to assume certain things stay pretty bad, and I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that correctly. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. Thanks, Chris, for the question. Let me talk a little bit about how we see gross margin progressing through the year. So we expected last quarter, and we continue to expect now, that Q2 is going to be our most challenging quarter in terms of margin pressure. And you saw that with our margins down about 33%. We continue to expect sequential improvement as we move throughout the balance of the year. And we continue to expect by Q4, we are in a position where we start to rebuild margins, and then we'd expect that to continue into fiscal year '23. Now to your question about what are the drivers in the back half of the year that will drive that sequential improvement. I'd point to a few. The first is pricing. Pricing will continue to build in terms of the value it generates for us as we move through the year. In Q1, it was fairly limited. It was about 50 basis points of benefit to margin. This last quarter is about 100 basis points. I think by Q3, it's starting to approach 200. It's probably still a little bit south of 200. And by the fourth quarter, I think the benefit will be well over 200 bps to gross margin. So you're going to see that building value from the pricing actions we have taken are the additional ones we announced today that will take over the back half of the year. In addition, when you think about our cost savings program, we're on track to have another very good year, but you will see that phasing in a little bit more back half weighted. And so in the front half of the year, we generated about 80 to 90 bps of benefit. You should see that north of 100 bps in the back half of the year, and that's just the timing of the projects, how they happen to play out this year. And then the other item I'd point to is, as you look at the cost inflation we're dealing with, Q2 was the most challenging quarter from a year-over-year perspective. As we get to the back half of the year, while we're still operating in an inflationary environment, the year-over-year change is much smaller because we really started to see a run up in commodities at the beginning of calendar year '21 with the ice storm in Texas. And so on a sequential basis in Q3 and Q4, those increases in both commodities, transportation, in manufacturing, there will be a lower hit to margin as we move through the quarters. And then finally, Chris, to your last comment, which is spot on as it relates to mix, we've talked about this for the last few quarters. We had a temporary benefit during the pandemic when we significantly reduced the number of products we offer to increase supply. As we are reintroducing our full line of products, including multipacks, that does have a mix yet. There will be about 4 quarters of that unwinding that temporary benefit, which will go through Q3, the current quarter end. And by the fourth quarter, we've lapped that, and we should not see a mix drag to margins as well. So we'll get that benefit. And then the last one is, as you mentioned, deleveraging. With volumes down in the front half of this year, there was some deleveraging that impacted margins. But in the back half of the year, we expect volumes to be flat, if not up. And so we should not expect that drag either. And so those are the elements of how we move through the year and why we expect to see margins building as we move through Q4. Chris Carey : And if I could just squeeze one more in. You talked about like $500 million of commodity and transportation expense versus the prior $350 million. With the incremental pricing, you're going to get some offset, but the earnings is coming down more. Just what's -- is it just everything else in there and just the deleveraging on cost and just all these other things that are harder to track beyond those 2 items that you called out. I'm just trying to, I guess, quantitatively complete the grid. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. So I'd say on the $350 million to $500 million, maybe just a couple of thoughts. So as we've talked, that's the increase we're seeing in commodities and transportation. While that's not the entire inflation we're dealing with, that's the bulk of it. That's the areas we're seeing the biggest year-over-year increase. But as I said, we're seeing inflation broadly across the portfolio. As it relates to pricing, as we've moved from planning to price 70% of our portfolio to now pricing 85%. And keep in mind, it's not just pricing 85%. We're also going back and taking multiple rounds of pricing for several of those brands within that 85%, but there tends to be a lag to that. And so we're going to incur that extra cost this year, now $500 million we're projecting. The pricing benefit will be modest as those pricing actions go into effect in the back half, and that's really setting ourselves up to get more benefit as we move into fiscal year '23. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : A couple of questions, I guess. Shifting to sales rather than margin. It looks like it's coming in a little bit better than expected. Can you maybe unpack that a bit? Is it a little bit more pricing is coming through than you had planned? Maybe the elasticity is lower than you thought? Or is it just that demand isn't really moderating at the rate that you might have expected? Linda Rendle : Kaumil, happy to get started on that one. We did see a strong quarter -- hi, Kaumil. We did see a strong quarter from a top line perspective, and really that continues to be the strength of our brands with our consumers. And we're seeing this broad-based across our categories where they continue to turn to our cleaning and disinfecting brands, our household essentials. And if you look across our 2-year stacks across all of our segments, we're in the strong double digits from a Q2 perspective. So what we're seeing, if you look at share, we're up in the majority of our business units. Our consumer value measure, which measures the amount of our portfolio that consumers deem superior, as an all-time high of 75%. So all of those investments we've made in advertising and sales promotion, innovation, executing against distribution as we got supply back in place are paying off, and demand remains robust. As we move forward, we're continuing to see long-term tailwinds that will continue from a portfolio perspective, which gives us confidence in getting to that 3% to 5% growth goal that we've spoken about in returning to that in the fourth quarter. And I would note some of the businesses in our household essentials were up even after a strong Q2 a year ago. So if you look at our Brita business, Food business, Glad, all off of a strong quarter a year ago. And again, it's behind the fundamentals, innovation and the fact that consumers continue to turn to trusted brands. Kaumil Gajrawala : Okay. Great. And then to clarify maybe a comment, Kevin. It takes 12 -- I think you said, it takes 12 to 18 months to offset cost inflation in this instance because it's so much more profound, it's likely to take several years. Is that -- is that several years to get back to kind of your run rate of the mid-40s on gross margins? Or were you maybe suggesting something else? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. Kaumil, I'll be a little cautious about providing an outlook beyond this year. But as Linda and I have said in the past, we are committed to rebuilding margins and getting back to that sort of mid-40s range we were before the pandemic began. And as I said, I do think it's going to take longer than what we've historically been able to do in terms of timing to recover margins at 12 to 18 months, just because of the sheer magnitude of the inflation we're dealing with. It's 3 to 5 times any previous inflationary cycle. So I would expect that time line to be extended. But again, keep in mind, there's a number of items we don't control that will impact the timing of how quickly we recover margins. We're going to just have to see how that plays out. I think we're going to be in a better position to estimate that. I'd like to get a few more quarters in our belt and see how the inflationary environment plays out. But I think as we prepare for fiscal year '23, we'll be in a better position to provide a perspective on the timing of that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. I wanted to just talk a little bit about working through inventory because last quarter, I think we had talked about the cash flow was weak in the inventory and finished goods in particular, was up, and that's kind of how we came to this, all of us, the realization around the external supply and estimating what was going to happen in terms of consumer demand.  Inventories grew again and sequentially. So you talked about volumes. You're hoping you get to up volumes by the end of the year. But I just want to talk about how you're thinking about working through inventory if there's particular categories where the overcapacity is more or less severe because, to Linda's point, there are businesses that are growing year-over-year in volume. And the degree to which some of these external supply contracts, it's easy to exit versus being contracted for certain amounts of supply for a given amount of time? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. Lauren, thanks for the question. Let me talk a little bit about inventory and where we're at and then where I see that going over the next several quarters. We ended the second quarter with about 65 days of inventory in hand across our enterprise. Typically, before the pandemic, we were carrying about 55 days. And so we have built inventories. We built inventories for 2 primary reasons. First, we have taken up inventory levels broadly across our portfolio to try to help us manage through the ongoing supply chain disruption. This helps ensure if we have disruptions on our ability to secure transportation or we have suppliers go down for any number of reasons that they're going down, we have inventories in the system where we continue to ship and meet demand. And so we think it's smart in the near term to invest some additional working capital to have higher inventories across the network. We do think, at some point, as the supply disruptions start to work themselves out, we're going to be able to take that down. The other area that we built up inventory as it relates to extending our supply chain through additional third-party manufacturers. As I just mentioned, as you add more nodes to our network, we are holding inventory in many of those locations. And so we have a number of additional locations throughout the world where we're storing and accounting for inventory. How I think this will play out, as I just mentioned, we will start stepping out of some of these supply agreements the back half of this year as demand is moderating and we set these up that we could step out these and we felt it was the right time to do that. We will start stepping out of those this year. And as I said, I expect by the end of this year, you'll start to see inventory levels come down as we start consolidating our manufacturing base. As it relates to taking inventory levels down that we have right now to manage the supply disruptions, much of that's going to be driven based on when we feel comfortable that we can count on the supply chain, and then we can count on trucks arriving when we need them, material being available when we need it. So we're going to have to see how that plays out. But I expect to start making progress this year. And then I expect, over time, in '23, we'll continue to make progress. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. That's great. And if I can sneak in one more. Linda, you commented on market -- I don't know if it was Linda, it was in your remarks, I apologize -- about market share improvement, where your on-shelf availability has improved. And that's certainly true in categories year-over-year, but there are certainly also categories where shares, at least as far as we can see in Nielsen, are down versus where you were in 2018, 2019. So I'm just curious, to be more constructive and you kind of look further out, what's the bogey? How do you think about where you want to be in terms of share? What's the right gauge of kind of success in reclaiming share positions because certainly, year-over-year progress is important. But if you kind of look back a little bit further, shares are still soft in certain categories on a multiyear basis? Linda Rendle : Lauren, yes, thank you. I'll build on that. So overall, I would say, from a market share perspective, we're feeling good about where we are returning to pre-pandemic share levels in aggregates and then growing in the majority of our businesses and continuing to make progress. Even if you look at the last 4 to 5 weeks, stronger share growth than we even experienced in the first half of the year. But that being said, we absolutely need to continue to make progress. And our goal is to grow share, and I've been super clear about that, and we continue to be focused on that. We want to win. We want to win in our categories. That doesn't mean we'll always win in every category at all times. There will be ups and downs as there's competitive spending, innovation launches and timing. But in aggregate, we're focused on growing market share in our categories, winning with our brands. And although we've made great progress, I'd point to Glad as a great example, growing Glad Trash's share after a long time of being flat to slightly down, but our innovation is working, pricing is working, et cetera. We're going to continue to make progress against the portfolio, and we intend to grow market share. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Two questions for me. Kevin, I'm sorry, I'm going to beat a dead horse here, but I'm going to come back to gross margin but attack it a little bit differently. I guess, like others on the call, I'm kind of wrestling a little bit with some of the commentary around the recovery as sort of as clear as our crystal ball may be today. But a little bit more structural. And I guess where I'm coming from with this, when we chatted in November, you sounded pretty good about an 18- to 24-month recovery. So what has changed dramatically over the past 3 months to make you a lot more cautious on the cadence of that recovery? And I guess, as I'm kind of looking at the quarter, and I think this was an earlier comment. I mean, the commodity piece certainly dire, but maybe not drastically more dire than we had modeled. The manufacturing logistics certainly worse. So just taking those pieces together, I'm just -- what has changed in your mind? What has changed internally for the company that makes you significantly more cautious on the pace of the recovery, the ability to price and offset it with productivity? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. Thanks, Kevin. A couple of thoughts on the ability to price. I feel very confident in our ability to price. We've executed pricing on 50% of our portfolio quite successfully through the second quarter. We still have some work to do over the balance of the year to get to that 85%. But many of those conversations with retailers have already occurred. So I feel very good about the work of the team and our ability to take the necessary pricing. And Kevin, as I mentioned earlier, we feel very good about the work we're doing on cost savings. We'll have another good year. What we are seeing, though, just broadly, inflation is getting more difficult. Sitting here today, we now think there's $500 million worth of cost inflation. 3 months ago, we thought that was $350 million. So I think seeing that level of inflation that we're continuing to deal with, that just means we've got more work to do on pricing, cost savings, and we'll have to see how long that takes. I think it's prudent to think about the time to do that, and I expect it to be longer than what we've done historically. And so I just think it's driven by an increasing inflationary environment we're dealing with and knowing that's going to take some time to work through. And I think, Kevin, as I said earlier, what I think is most important is make sure we continue to stay balanced. We have top line momentum. We're going to continue to invest to maintain that momentum. And then we're going to rebuild margins at the appropriate pace that allows us to do both. And so we're going to continue to be very focused on doing both and doing both well, and we think that's how we're going to maximize the value of the company. And so I think looking out a couple of years and expecting recovery over that period of time seems reasonable. But obviously, I think over the next few quarters, we'll get more visibility to be able to update you as we learn more. Kevin Grundy : Okay. And just a quick follow-up for Linda. Can you just comment on expectations or potential risk around trade down in your categories, given this level of pricing and the handful of categories where you have higher private label exposure? And then I'll pass it on. Linda Rendle : Sure, Kevin. Generally, if you look at our categories, we don't really have very high private label exposure. It's concentrated in a few categories. And in those categories, we have a very strong share position and have for many years. And I just turn to the facts on the strength of our brands. So I spoke about earlier the fact that our superiority rating by consumers is at the highest it's ever been. So 75% of our portfolio is deemed superior by consumers. If you look at the trends on private label through the pandemic, private label continues to not make progress on share. Consumers are turning to a trusted brand. During this entire time, we've been investing in those brands through advertising and sales promotion and a really terrific innovation program that's -- we're continuing to see the benefits of all of the innovations we've launched are off to a strong start, and we launched new innovations this quarter with more coming in the back half.  So when I think about where we are, our brands are in a better position than they were pre-pandemic and really been even at the height of the pandemic. And so we feel confident in our ability to take pricing. We are watching very closely the impacts that inflation will have on consumers. I think there's a lot of unknowns in that. But if you look back at how we've performed during times of economic stress for consumers, given the fact that we're in household essentials categories, we tend to fare pretty well, our categories fare well, and we would expect that to continue. The other thing I would note is that we are seeing pricing generally in line with what we've taken in the category. So private label is moving as well, and we expect our price gaps to be about what they were pre-pandemic and pre-pricing, and that will also help us as we move forward. So I feel as confident as I can given the strength of our brands and our ability to execute these price increases. Again, we're going to watch consumers carefully as we go through this period. But we think we're in a good position to pass through these price increases and continue our momentum on top line. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : A couple of quick questions. The gross margin contribution from price, a little north of 200 bps in the fourth quarter. Is that going to reflect like sort of full price? Are you going to have all the price increases in the fourth quarter? Or are there more to come as we get out to fiscal '23? Kevin Jacobsen : Jason, on pricing, and I won't comment on pricing in fiscal year '23. Let me just talk about our plans this year. As I -- as we said, we've implemented 50%. We've got some more work to do. Some of that will go into effect this quarter, Q3, but we have some additional pricing actions that go in place in Q4. And so as I said, north of 200 bps in the fourth quarter would not be the full value because you won't have the full Q4 impact from some of those pricing actions, which would suggest, as we get into fiscal year '23, you'll see that continue to build. And then we're going to remain open so we're going to continue to evaluate the cost environment. We stand prepared to take more pricing, if necessary, if that's what's required to recover margin. I'd say it's too early to make that call. We want to see how we think inflation is going to play out as we get through this fiscal year. And then based on that, we'll make decisions on '23 pricing. But that's something we'll certainly consider. Jason English : Understood. And Linda, pre-COVID, there were a number of your business lines that were suffering from some market share losses, whether it be from some branded competitors or private label. It's obviously encouraging to see the recovery and the growth that you're now experiencing. But it's coming on a much more subdued rate of price than we've seen in most of your other categories. In other words, it's coming on price gaps going down. So your value proposition is improving, and your market share is getting better. You mentioned trash bag, it's a great example. You can see it. How much of your market share do you think is coming from that? And is part of what's happened here a bit of a permanent rebase in your pricing architecture and therefore, permanent rebasing in margin structure? Linda Rendle : Jason, I think what's true in the data and what will be true over the coming months as pricing settles out in the categories is there's definitely going to be variability in terms of price gaps, et cetera. But what we have not seen is a material change in our price gaps in aggregate in the categories. There's some pluses and minuses depending on pricing implementation timing. But that really isn't what we're seeing driving the strengths in our brand. The majority is attributed to good execution. We're seeing distribution increases, return to merch, although lower than pre-COVID levels, as well as our strong innovation plans taking hold. So as we look at the drivers, we're seeing the majority of that share driven by factors that are within our control versus price gaps, et cetera.  Again, this is going to play out over the next few months, but we do not expect price gaps to be a driver of our performance moving forward. We expect for them to be about what they were pre-COVID. That's not what our intent is. Our intent is to win through innovation. Our intent is to win through brand building and continued spending on advertising and sales promotion and investing in our categories. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Peter Grom of UBS. Peter Grom : So I guess by my bigger question is just do you feel like you've embedded enough flex in this guidance that gives you comfort or should give investors comfort that this is really it in terms of negative revisions? And then I guess just following up on the commentary on phasing on purchase margin in the back half of the year. I know you mentioned a few -- 4Q up and sequential improvement in Q3. But can you maybe help us directionally in terms of how much improvement in Q3 because down 1,200 basis points is quite a bit. And then Kevin, I think previously, as we exited the year, it was a return to the low 40s in terms of gross margin. So just like any thought around the rate of improvement that we should be expecting now as we exit the year. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. Thanks, Peter. Let me talk about -- your question was on the plan. Overall, I think we have a balanced outlook for this year. I feel very good about the areas we directly control, whether that's our pricing actions, our cost savings efforts or the work we're doing in innovation. But I also recognize we are operating in an environment that is much more volatile. And so not knowing exactly how inflation will play out, consumer demand, I think the outlook we provided is appropriate. You'll also see that our outlook ranges are a bit wider than we might normally provide this time of year. We also think that's appropriate given the level of volatility in some of those areas we don't directly control. So overall, I feel like we provide a good balanced outlook for the year that allows for some variability across a number of different drivers. And then as it relates to phasing, I would expect, as I said, progression through the year, starting in Q3. Right now, we're looking at Q3 margins probably in the mid-30s, building on where we land in Q2. And then previously, we had anticipated we'd be in the low 40s. I expect with the increased level of inflation, we'll likely finish the year in the high 30s, and then we would look to build on that as we move into fiscal year '23. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser with D.A. Davidson. Linda Bolton-Weiser: So I actually have a question that's not on gross margin. I was just wondering in your Brita business, have you experienced any issues with the EPA labeling your competitor, Helen of Troy had to halt shipments so they could redo some labeling as per EPA regulation changes. Are you experiencing that? Or do you expect to experience that in your Brita business? Linda Rendle : Linda, no, we do not have that issue. And maybe I'll just take an opportunity to point to what's going on in Brita right now because I think it's a really great story. Brita has been a terrific success over this pandemic as people have turned to filtered water to meet their needs. And I think it's twofold. One, people are spending more time worried about their health and wellness, and drinking more water is important. And second, they're thinking about their impact on the planet through sustainability.  So Brita has been a business that has very, very strong double-digit growth. We've grown share 5 points in the last quarter. And if you look at our household penetration, it's the highest it's been in 8 years. So feel really good about the future of this business. Our innovation pipeline is strong, and it's one that we plan to continue to accelerate moving forward. But we don't have any of those issues holding us back from an EPA perspective. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle, I will now like to turn the program back to you. Linda Rendle : Great. Thank you. Thanks, everyone. We look forward to speaking to you again on our next call in May. And until then, please stay well. Operator : And this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. Lisah Burhan : Thank you, Erica. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Linda Rendle, our CEO and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. I hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. In just a moment, Linda will share a few opening comments and then we will take your questions. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, including about our fiscal year 2022 outlook and the potential impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our business. These statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations, but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements and the non-GAAP financial information section, including the tables that reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, both of which are located at the end of today\u2019s earnings release, which has also been filed with the SEC. Now, I will turn it over to Linda. Linda Rendle : Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I hope you and your families are well. Hopefully, you found our prepared remarks helpful. I am encouraged that we continue to see strong consumer demand for our brands and made progress on our near-term and long-term strategic plans in the third quarter amid a highly dynamic and challenging environment. Importantly, we delivered on our commitment to drive sequential gross margin improvement. We executed well on the factors under our control, leveraging the strength of our brands to grow share, sustain top line momentum and begin to rebuild margin. We continue to drive our innovation pipeline, deliver cost savings, generate operational improvements across our supply chain, and take additional inflation-driven pricing actions, all while keeping our eye on the long-term. There is no question that it\u2019s a volatile operating environment. The rising cost inflation we are experiencing is reflected in our updated fiscal 2022 outlook. That considered I am confident that our fundamentals are strong and that the actions we are taking and the progress we have made put us on the right trajectory to drive long-term profitable growth and create shareholder value. With that, Kevin and I will open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Linda. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned summer price increases. Can you just give us a bit more detail on which categories you have announced pricing in the magnitude? And what percent of your portfolio will have multiple rounds of price increases in by the summer? And then just taking a step back as we look out longer-term, obviously, some sequential gross margin recovery in fiscal Q3, it sounds like you are expecting more in fiscal Q4 in the prepared remarks. Can you just discuss conceptually with this new cost outlook, with the pricing going into place, how quickly you expect to rebuild gross margins over the next few years just relative to the pronounced pressure you are expecting this year? Thanks. Linda Rendle : Sounds good. I will start with where we are on pricing. So as you recall, we announced a round of pricing, our first round in the fall that was fairly broad across our portfolio. We have since taken a subsequent round that was effective this month in April and we are starting to see that flow through in the marketplace. And then we have an additional round of pricing scheduled for July that is also broad across our portfolio and we are actually going deeper than we had intended to go when we first announced the price increase given what we are seeing from the impact on Ukraine. So, we made that decision shortly after we saw the impacts. In total, the vast majority of our portfolio will be priced. And the majority of the portfolio will also have multiple rounds across all three of those time periods by the time we get to July. Kevin can talk a bit about what that means for gross margin and sequential improvement. Kevin Jacobsen : Hey, Dara. On gross margin, no change to our longer-term expectations, what we\u2019ve been talking about for the last couple of quarters. What I would say is that you folks saw in our prepared remarks, we are really pleased with the progress we made in Q3. We sequentially improved margins, a little under 300 basis points. It\u2019s going to be more challenging for us in Q4. We have rolled in the increased energy prices as a result of the war in Ukraine and we think that\u2019s going to be about a $30 million headwind in Q4. As a result of that, I think it could be more modest progress sequentially in Q4. And then we continue to build our plans to ensure that we continue that progress in fiscal year \u201823. I will hold off, but I am sure you can appreciate giving an exact outlook right now. We will do that in August. But the plans we are building would keep us on track to keep building, rebuilding margins in fiscal year \u201823. And then I would say for us, beyond that, nothing else has really changed with the exception that we have got increased cost headwinds. And importantly, we think we are taking the right actions to address those. As Linda just mentioned, we have increased the pricing that we have already announced, they go in effect in July. So we think we are taking the right actions to address this next round of inflation we are dealing with. But as is typical, there is going to be a lag here. We will take a bit more of a hit in Q4. And then the actions we are taking, we will see start in our Q1 fiscal year \u201823. Dara Mohsenian : Okay, great. And then can you talk a little bit about the price gaps versus competition? And with the actions you are taking, if you have seen competitors move already and where that leaves you? And perhaps the demand elasticity you are seeing from the price increases you already took from a consumer standpoint? Linda Rendle : Sure. As it relates to price gaps, we said it would be dynamic and it certainly is. We take pricing and then the rest of the category continues to do that. So we are seeing some price gaps in line and others where we are a bit behind. But we expect where July pricing goes into effect that the price gaps will be about what they were pre-pandemic. We don\u2019t intend to change price gaps through this action, but that\u2019s going to take a little while and a little noise to play out coming here as we take these next two increases, this one this month and, of course, the one in July. And then as we look forward into what we would experience coming into inflation from a consumer perspective, also with pricing, that\u2019s something that we are watching really closely from a category perspective. I think it\u2019s important to note that given the price gap dynamics too, we are also looking very closely at merchandising and what\u2019s happening. That still continues to be lower than it was pre-pandemic, but we have seen levels increase. But I would say, on average, it\u2019s been very rational. We have seen private label and other branded players move, but we continue to watch it closely and again, do not expect price gaps to be any different when this all nets out in July. Dara Mohsenian : Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. So I wanted to just follow-up on the pricing. So you announced, I am assuming this additional pricing, I am not sure if you were \u2013 it was on the plan for the month that you initiated now in April, of course, July is extra and goes into fiscal \u201823. But I was hoping to see you didn\u2019t change at the end. You didn\u2019t change the guidance much for the top line. So I am assuming you are embedding some sort of elasticity. Just going back to the point earlier, are you assuming elasticities come back to normal or you are seeing still below trend? And then just drilling down on the additional pricing you are taking, what are the categories that you are \u2013 I am assuming bags and charcoal would be \u2013 sorry and also latter would be the ones that you are taking additional pricing? Linda Rendle : Sure. So, we had always planned to take an April price increase, which of course is in market now. July, we had intended to take, but we are going broader and deeper in that pricing given what we are seeing as impacts from the war in Ukraine. But we keep \u2013 we are keeping that timing in July and you are right that will impact mostly as we look forward into fiscal year \u201823, but April will start to help in Q4. As it relates to the categories that we are pricing, this is pretty broad pricing in April and July. You mentioned bags, bags will be part of both of those increases happened in April, will happen again in July given what we are seeing in the resin market, but we will be very broad across the rest of our portfolio as well. And we would expect given what we are seeing across the pricing, across our competitors that, that will be true for the remainder of the category : competitors, private label and branded. As we look at what we expect to see beyond that, it\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019s going to depend on what we see for energy for the remainder of the year, what we see in commodities, but we feel like we have taken the right amount of pricing based on what we are announcing in July in order to deal with the environment that we are seeing right now. Andrea Teixeira : And any additional distribution that is embedded getting out of the quarter and into the fourth quarter that you regained given your service levels improved that you would highlight? Linda Rendle : Yes. So, we did see an increase in total distribution points and share of assortment in this latest quarter, which was great to see. So, total distribution points were up 10%. And we grew share of assortment by a full point and that is a number of things. One, of course, you highlight, which is the fact that we are back into supply in many of our categories and service levels are improving, but importantly, too, this is the good work our sales and marketing teams are doing on category growth plans with our retailers. And of course, the innovation that we have in market that\u2019s performing really well and we are seeing strong distribution results behind all of that. So in total, in a very good place from a distribution perspective and we would continue to expect to make progress in Q4 based on what we know our plans to be in the coming couple of months. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, Linda. I will pass it on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS. Peter Grom : Hey, good afternoon everyone. Hope you are doing well. So I just wanted to ask about the company\u2019s updated organic sales outlook and I could be clearly over-thinking this. But if you go back through the last few quarterly releases, each provided some comment around the return to the company\u2019s long-term organic sales algorithm of 3% to 5%? And maybe I missed it today, but I didn\u2019t see. One, it really just could be implied in the comment around sequential improvement, but a 3-point range for the full year implies a pretty wide gap for 4Q. So just how are you thinking about organic sales growth in the fourth quarter? And how does that inform your view on returning to the algorithm long-term? Thanks. Kevin Jacobsen : Hey, Peter, thanks for the question. In regard to our outlook, it is, and we talked about this before, it is wider than what we would typically have this time of year, and we think that\u2019s appropriate for the environment we\u2019re operating in. Having said that, we feel very good about sales expectations in the fourth quarter. As we said, we expect sequential improvements from where we landed in Q3 at 2%. But I think the items we\u2019re also thoughtful about that widens our range. Keep in mind, we\u2019re taking another round of pricing that went into the market in April. As Linda just mentioned, our expectation, similar to our previous round is that elasticities will be slightly better than what we\u2019ve seen historically. So that\u2019s embedded in the outlook as well. And then also keep in mind, competition has taken quite a bit of pricing right now at the same time. And while we don\u2019t know what they are doing nor should we, if they go before us, after us, the amounts they go will create some variability in our results as well. So with all that in mind, we think it\u2019s appropriate to have a bit wider range, but having said that, nothing has changed since we spoke last quarter. We\u2019re very much on track for the top line for the full year. And again, I expect sequential improvement from where we landed in Q3, but the range is a bit wider for the reasons I mentioned. Peter Grom : Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. And then maybe just one point of clarification, Linda, I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you transitioned external manufacturing from a large group to just a few strategic suppliers. And just going back to last quarter, that was widely discussed as a key driver of the gross margin pressure you were dealing with. So can you maybe unpack that comment? Is that just related to the number of suppliers you were using or are you kind of now closer to that 80-20 mix in terms of in-house versus outsourced and manufacturing? Thanks. Linda Rendle : Sure. Yes. As we discussed, we used a broad range of external partners during the height of the pandemic to ensure that we could meet consumer demand. And we built that very intentionally so that we could ensure that we\u2019ve built an optimized network once we got into more of an endemic phase of the pandemic. And as we head into that, we\u2019ve done just that. We\u2019ve been able to consolidate and narrow the external manufacturer portfolio we have to strategic partners. We\u2019ve been able to in-house, and we\u2019re working through that in Q3 and Q4. We expect the vast majority of that benefit to begin hitting in fiscal year \u201823. But we are well on track to doing what we talked about in terms of that supply chain optimization. Peter Grom : Great. Thank you. Best of luck. Linda Rendle : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Chris Carey : Hi, everyone. Linda Rendle : Hi, Chris. Chris Carey : So \u2013 hey, how are you? I just wanted to follow-up on the question around manufacturing and logistics, that\u2019s great to hear, obviously, commodities getting worse in fiscal Q4. I mean, would you expect the manufacturing and logistics line to get materially better sequentially from here starting in fiscal Q4 and going into next year? As you have some of these easier comps, maybe it even turns into a net positive as you\u2019ve started to unwind this owned versus co-man network that you have? Is that a reasonable assumption going forward? Kevin Jacobsen : Hey, Chris, what I\u2019d say as it relates to manufacturing and logistics and commodities is, I do expect \u2013 maybe I\u2019ll start with manufacturing and logistics. I do expect to see some sequential improvement as we move now through the end of this year, so just this last quarter. And there is a couple of areas I\u2019d point to. The first is what Linda talked about. We\u2019re making good progress, as we said we would, on optimizing our supply chain and stepping out of these third-party contract manufacturers. We\u2019re also seeing some, I would say, pullback in transportation in the spot rates. I think you\u2019ve heard us talk about that for the last couple of quarters. We\u2019ve seen a significant increase in the cost of carriers in the spot market. That premium is starting to come down a bit, which is a little bit of a benefit in the third quarter. And I\u2019d like to believe we\u2019re going to see that continue to go forward. So that should certainly help as well. And then we continue to optimize our supply chain beyond just the contract manufacturers. If you recall, as part of the work we did during the pandemic, we significantly extended our supply chain to ensure we had backup suppliers given all the disruptions we are facing. As that supply chain starts to level out, and we\u2019re able to step out of some of those relationships with material suppliers, that also should reduce our cost. I mean if you can imagine, we were sourcing product from Asia. We had to deal with the freight to get that product here as we can step out of some of those and get back to our core suppliers, there is more opportunity there. So this has clearly been an opportunity for us. As we\u2019ve talked going forward, how we will rebuild margins is really in three buckets : it first starts with our cost savings program. We\u2019re also going after the supply chain costs that we built up over the pandemic that we\u2019re in the process of taking out. And then it\u2019s the pricing actions that we talked about. And as those three levers, we\u2019re going to keep pulling on that we think put us in a position to sequentially keep improving margins. And I\u2019d expect to see some of that benefit flow through this quarter and then continue next year as well. Chris Carey : Okay, thanks so much for that perspective. And then one quick follow-up, just on SG&A, a little bit better versus prior expectations. How much of what you\u2019re doing this fiscal year is something sustainable that you think can carry into next year versus things that might be a bit more point in time like lower variable compensation or anything else that might reverse back into SG&A next year with the adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales running pretty low relative to historicals? So, thanks again. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. And Chris, maybe two points of view on SG&A. One issue is unreal, the structural changes. In our Q3, our SG&A was about a point lower than we had projected. We have a pension program and the ability for our employees to defer compensation that they invest in the stock market. As you know, the stock market was down in the third quarter, so that reduces our liabilities to our employees. That reduced it by 1 point. That has no impact on EPS. That\u2019s offset in other income and expense because the value of the portfolio went down to us by an equal and offsetting them out. So that\u2019s a bit of noise on the P&L, that was about a 1 point reduction. But your comment on structural changes, we continues to make progress in admin we\u2019re on track to deliver our cost savings commitment this year, 175 basis points of EBIT margin expansion. And what you\u2019ll see is a nice amount of that coming from admin. Typically, product supply, we delivered the largest source of value of that 175 basis point goal. That will be true this year as well, but I\u2019d say a little bit more coming out of admin than typical and that should be structural that we can carry forward. Chris Carey : Okay, thank you both. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, thanks, Chris. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hi, everybody. Maybe a follow-up to Chris\u2019s question, but more specific on ad spend. It looks like ad spend maybe came off a little bit or maybe it was a little bit lower more than plan. You obviously gave us some guide on where it\u2019s expected to be. Can you just talk about how you\u2019re thinking about that line? Linda Rendle : Sure. We\u2019re still on track for 10% to the year, which is exactly our commitment. And I think you know how strong we feel about advertising as a strategic lever to build our brands and ensure we have superior value. So in this quarter, just timing and on track for 10% for the year. Kaumil Gajrawala : Okay. Great. And then on, I guess, trade spend and the impact on revenue, it looks like trade spend is up quite a bit, has a bit of a mix effect. As you\u2019re discussing pricing and incremental price increases. Can you just give us a context on how much of that maybe will be offset by \u2013 it sounds like promo activity is increasing and such? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. Maybe a couple of thoughts on I\u2019ll talk price mix and the impact of trade spend within price/mix. If you saw our results in Q3, two points of volume growth, we had four points of benefit from pricing. And then we had four points of unfavorable mix and higher trade spending. And we\u2019ve talked about that the last couple of quarters. We had a temporary benefit during the pandemic as we went down to smaller sizes to increase throughput from our plants as well as there is effectively no promotional activity on several of our categories, where there is a lack of product availability. We had about a four-point price/mix benefit for about four straight quarters during the pandemic. That was a temporary benefit that we knew would unwind. It has been unwinding for several quarters. Q3 was the last quarter, we\u2019ve now lapped that. And so that drag in Q3 should no longer occur as we move forward. So that 4 point hit of increased mix and trade was really just unwinding the temporary benefit we had during the pandemic. And so I expect to see a greater benefit from price/mix going forward as we\u2019re getting the full benefit from pricing and no longer lapping that temporary benefit. Kaumil Gajrawala : That\u2019s useful, thank you. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good afternoon folks. Thanks for taking my question. So, I think you partially answered this with the pension benefit this quarter. But your guidance, historically, your EBIT margins step up nicely in the fourth quarter from your third quarter, but your guidance implies that you\u2019re not going to see that historical progression. In fact, it suggests that you\u2019re going to see fairly sizable degradation operating margins from the third to the fourth quarter. So I appreciate that you have sequential improvement in gross margin. But what\u2019s driving the substantial dip in EBIT margins and your outlook from 3Q to 4Q? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, Jason, thanks for the question. And you\u2019re right, we do expect that to be the case. As you mentioned, we expect sequential improvement on the top line. And we do think we will make some very modest sequential improvement in gross margin in Q4. But what\u2019s offsetting that is two items : first is on admin, you\u2019ll see an increased spending in admin in Q4, I suspect we will be somewhere in the 15% to 16% of sales, and that\u2019s really the timing on the investments we\u2019re making in our digital transformation efforts; they really start to ramp up in the fourth quarter. So about 40% of the total spend you\u2019ll see in Q4 and so with a rate sort of in that 15% to 16%. And then Linda just mentioned on advertising, we\u2019re not concerned about the investments by quarter. We managed the year. And so we\u2019re still targeting 10%. So you\u2019ll see an elevated level of advertising investment in Q4 relative to Q3 that keeps us on track for 10% for the year. Jason English : And were you referring to your pro forma numbers or your GAAP numbers? Kevin Jacobsen : Those are GAAP numbers. Jason English : So I\u2019m just doing all in pro forma. You\u2019ve got a massive drop in your pro forma guidance for fourth quarter. So I assume that, that isn\u2019t actually related to the digital transformation since you guys are excluding that. Am I correct? Kevin Jacobsen : That\u2019s correct, yes. Jason English : Okay. Is there something else to... Kevin Jacobsen : So, what you will see is \u2013 no, you will see the increased advertising would be the primary item. As we step, it will be nicely over 10%, I suspect that gives us the 10% for the full year. Jason English : Got it. And on SG&A, is it incentive comp, should we expect to reload that next year? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, we should. We are a pay-for-performance company and we are below our goal this year. So, we are paying out less than a percent, and an expectation, we had reset that to our plans in fiscal year \u201823. So, it would step up to a targeted 100% payout. Jason English : Okay. I will follow-up offline to trying get the quantum on that. Thank you very much. Kevin Jacobsen : Okay. Thanks Jason. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. So Linda, my question pertains to private label. And more broadly, just trade down risk and how you see this playing out given the state of the consumer, so as we look at the Nielsen data, and everyone has been sort of very much watching that to see trade down within categories, is private label gaining share? More broadly, as you know, since the start of the pandemic, that\u2019s not been the case. We have seen a little tick up more recently. But I think it stands out because it\u2019s been in some of your categories and particularly those that even historically have been more exposed to private label. So, that being bleach, charcoal wipes. So, you mentioned that you have seen private label move on price as well. Maybe just comment on how you are thinking about this now competitively? And how you see this playing out? That is, is the state of the consumer and potential risk there trade down in your categories. And maybe just sort of comment on some of the share gains that we have seen in private label more recently in the syndicated data. Thanks. Linda Rendle : Sure. Hi Kevin. What we are continuing to see is consumers choosing trusted brands and you highlighted it well. We definitely saw, during the pandemic, people in our categories, choosing brands they could trust given what was going on in their lives and that continues. We have seen, over the last quarter, a marginal improvement in private label share, pretty minimal and we think that\u2019s mainly related to getting distribution back in line to pre-pandemic levels, but no meaningful share gains and still lower than pre-pandemic. If you also look at kind of more leading indicators, household penetration also did not keep pace for private label during this time and we expect that to continue to have an impact as we move forward. And as we head into this period, consumers are absolutely under a lot of stress, but we are seeing what we expect in our categories at this point. Private label has taken pricing as we have taken pricing and competitors have. We are seeing pretty rational behavior there. And from a consumer perspective, we continue to see what we expect, so elasticity is in line, slightly better across our categories, meaning, of course, we are seeing volume decline, but a little less than we had anticipated. And we are seeing that across the category. We are going to watch it really closely, but we think we are very well positioned based off of the superior value of our brands. And I know, Kevin, we have mentioned this before, but 75% of our portfolio at this time is deemed superior by consumers. Of course, that\u2019s a combination of not only price, but brand and the product experience we deliver, and we continue to be laser-focused on that. So, continuing our investment in our brands, continuing on innovation, ensuring we have the right price pack architecture to ensure we cover all ranges of value for the consumer. But we feel really good about where we are. We are seeing no signs of abnormal stress with consumers in our categories, but we are going to watch it very closely as we head into this period. Kevin Grundy : That\u2019s great. Thank you and I appreciate it. Good luck. Linda Rendle : Thanks Kevin. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Hey everybody. Good afternoon. First, just a follow-up on the July price increase, I guess the question I am left with after the prior discussion is just, is that price increase meant to fully offset the inflation you have seen build since February, or as we think about the broader gross margin rebuild, we have to lean a bit more on productivity and other levers to help that gross margin along. I just wasn\u2019t clear on the prior commentary. Kevin Jacobsen : Hi Steve. As it relates to pricing, what I would say is it\u2019s really requires to lean in on all the levers we have available. So, it\u2019s leaning into our cost savings program. It\u2019s working to take costs out of our supply chain and it\u2019s taking pricing. We believe we \u2013 across all three of those activities that puts us in a position to continue to rebuild margins. But pricing alone would not put us in a position to do that. Steve Powers : Okay. Fair enough. And then I guess you touched a little bit upon it with your \u2013 just a commentary broadly on the supply chain. But could you just give us a bit of perspective as to where your service levels sits exiting the third quarter? Where you feel like you have restored service levels to where you would like them to be? Where there is still some more work in the portfolio to do on upfront? Just that would be helpful. Linda Rendle : Sure. We have seen service levels improve, which is terrific news and really my hats off to our combined team, who is working hard because at the same time, we have had to increase the portion of our portfolio that was on allocation during this time. And that\u2019s really due to two things. One, we have seen stronger demand in portions of our portfolio and then some material constraints and labor shortages across the supply chain that are impacting our ability to get raw materials. But I would say our team is handling that, working really closely with our retailer partners, really closely with our logistics partners, and so as a result, service is improving, and we expect continued improvement in Q4. Steve Powers : Okay. And lastly, if I could just kind of building on the conversation you are having with Kevin around the consumer being under stress. Does it change at all the influence the way that you approach R&D and new products prioritization as you think about fiscal Q3 and beyond? Just the way you are thinking about R&D, are you focused more than you might normally be on hitting value price points or is it \u2013 are we not at that stage? Linda Rendle : I think it\u2019s important for us to pull all value levers and that\u2019s going to continue to be true. So, our innovation pipeline always focuses on doing the base work that you would expect us to do product improvements, claims work, ensuring that we are communicating to people why our products work better than competition and why they can trust us and they issued us. So, that good work is always going on in good times and in tougher times for the consumer, and we will continue to leverage that. Importantly, though, consumers are continuing to look for innovative products that give them new experiences, so we will focus on the basics, but we will not take the foot off the pedal when it comes to introducing new experiences to them that help them do things better. For example, in the cleaning category, we just launched a premium line of Clorox Disinfecting Misters. They are off to a very strong start in the market. There is \u2013 it\u2019s a refill model, so it also helps people reduce their waste at home and really a great experience. And that\u2019s a premium-priced product, but we think it helps them get the job done at a better value at home, and we expect that to continue to do really well as we head into this period. So, I would say we are always focused on that base work, but we will not take the foot off the gas on continuing to expand the presence our brands have and continue to give people new innovative solutions in our categories. Steve Powers : Okay. Thanks for the perspective. Linda Rendle : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about expectations for the promotional environment? As incremental pricing comes in, we have heard some other companies start to talk about the inevitable building of pressure on consumer wallets and an expectation that promotions could kick up in the second half of the year. So, I was just curious on your perspective on that, so I will start there. Linda Rendle : Sure. Hi Lauren. What we are seeing now is promos are definitely above a year ago, but still below pre-pandemic levels. And as you know, for our categories, price promotion is actually a very small portion of the volume that we sell. It\u2019s less than 10% of the volume that we do on average is on price promotions. But we are watching that carefully because you are right, in times of recession that can be a lever that people pull and will pull to the degree needed to introduce new items to consumers to ensure that we are getting them at the right pulp periods of the year. But at this point, we don\u2019t see anything abnormal in our categories, something again that we will watch carefully, particularly as these next rounds of pricing go in. And we will use it as a lever if we need to, as we always do, but very strategically and how we target the consumer. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Great. And then I can probably take this offline with Lisah, but I did just want to throw this out on gross margins. I feel like, Kevin, your comments on sequential improvement in 4Q being there, but being not nearly as significant as you just saw Q2 to Q3. But I think to tie to gross margins down 800 basis points for the year, gross margins have to be significantly better sequentially. So, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an obvious thing that jumps out? If it\u2019s GAAP versus non-GAAP, there is something I am not aware of? Yes. So, anything that seems stands out to you or I can follow-up with Lisah if it\u2019s better for that for offline? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. Lauren, maybe just I will give you a perspective. But yes, please follow-up with Lisah, if this doesn\u2019t answer your question. When we started last quarter, our expectations was gross margin to be in the high-30s is I think I described it for Q4. With the war in Ukraine, we are building in about $30 million of additional costs, and most of that\u2019s going to hit in Q4, just the way it flows through our inventory than onto our P&L. So, $30 million hit in the fourth quarter is going to add about 150 basis points to 200 basis points of additional drag on margin, above what we thought when we were talking last quarter. When you do that math, you get down to, I would say, modest sequential improvement versus where we landed in Q3. So, we landed at about 36%. We are going to absorb another $30 million in Q4, and the team is working very hard to continue to expand margins in spite of the additional $30 million we are going to deal with. But it should put you then to get to the numbers we are talking about, should put you are just slightly above the Q3 level, which was just under 36%. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. It was the absolute level in the quarter, not the year-over-year change that\u2026? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. I am sorry, Lauren, you are exactly correct. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. Sequential improvement from where we landed in Q3. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. That clarified it. Okay, great. Thank you so much. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. Thanks Lauren. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thanks so much for the follow-up. I had a similar question to Lauren\u2019s. But now, on the operating income, if I am not mistaken, I heard 170 basis points, I am trying to go back to the notes. Did you give some sort of a guide for the operating income margin? Kevin Jacobsen : No, Andrea. We were talking about our cost savings goal of 175 basis points of EBIT margin expansion each year, and we are on track to deliver that this year. Andrea Teixeira : Okay. And that\u2019s embedded in the bridge that you gave out on the others, right? Kevin Jacobsen : It is. Andrea Teixeira : Correct. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle, I will now turn the podium back over to you. Linda Rendle : Thanks Erica. Thanks again to everyone on the call. I look forward to speaking to you again on our next call in August. Until then, please stay well. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Clorox Company Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question and answer session. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. Lisah Burhan : Thanks Paul. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Linda Rendle, our CEO and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. I hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. In just a moment, Linda will share a few opening comments and then we will take your questions. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, including about our fiscal 2023 outlook. These statements are based on management's current expectations, but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statement section, which identify various factors that could affect any such forward-looking statements, which has been filed with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the non-GAAP Financial Information section in our earnings release and the supplemental financial schedules in the Investor Relations section of our website for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Now I'll turn it over to Linda. Linda Rendle : Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us. Our fiscal 2022 results reflect a very challenging operating environment, including record-high input cost inflation and ongoing pandemic-driven volatility. We navigated this environment by taking a broad set of actions within our control to rebuild margin while continuing to invest in innovation and our portfolio of trusted brands to position Clorox for long-term success. This allowed us to deliver results in line with our outlook, including another quarter of sequential gross margin improvement. While we look forward to a return to our more normalized environment, we are not there yet. We expect the environment to remain difficult in fiscal '23, as we lap COVID impacts on our business, demand continues to normalize, particularly in our cleaning and disinfecting portfolio and factors like input cost inflation and supply chain disruptions persist. We'll keep addressing these challenges head on through actions that include revenue management, further pricing, ongoing cost management and supply chain optimization, our digital transformation and the streamline operating model. We announced today. At the same time, we're committed to maintaining our category leadership and delivering superior consumer value. I'm confident that our Ignite strategy continues to position us well for the future. We remain committed to delivering on our 3% to 5% sales growth target over the long term and are on the right path to drive consistent profitable growth over time and create shareholder value. With that. Kevin and I will open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] And our first question comes from Peter Grom of UBS. Your line is open. Peter Grom : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. So I guess I just kind of wanted to start with a pretty broad question. On the initial guidance, just kind of given where it all landed versus expectations, I would be curious like Linda or Kevin, would you characterize this outlook as conservative? Is it prudent? Just trying to understand the comfort and the range at this point, just given what we've seen over the past year. Kevin Jacobsen : Hi, Peter. Thanks for the question. Yeah, let me talk about our guidance and maybe a few thoughts. The first is we view this guidance as balanced, but certainly balance in what we see today. As you saw in our outlook, we provided a wider range, both on the top and bottom line. And I think what that really indicates is we believe we continue to operate in an environment of heightened volatility and I'll be the first to admit, I don't think we've done a particularly good job of estimating the cost environment. And so, as we look forward, we're projecting about $400 million worth of cost inflation or supply chain. We think that's a balanced approach to take at this point, but I'll acknowledge there's a lot of variability there. We're going to watch that very closely and obviously update folks as we progress through the year. But we think to start the year, this is the right outlook. And again, the wider ranges speak to the heightened volatility we're dealing with. Peter Grom : Thanks. And then maybe just following up on just the organic sales outlook, but just trying to understand the confidence around the continued strength across the rest of the rest of the portfolio, you highlighted the release and to prepare remarks that organic sales growth, excluding cleaning was -- I think was up mid-single digit. So is that kind of the expectation moving forward? And if so, what kind of gives you confidence that you won't see the moderation in some of these other categories looking ahead? Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah, Peter, we feel very good about our portfolio overall. As you saw in our prepared remarks, if we set aside the health and wellness sector, and if you start with Q4, for the rest of our portfolio, our household essentials, our international business, we about 5% organic growth feel very good about the strength of that portfolio. When you think about health and wellness, I would say pricing is playing out very much as we expected. Elasticities continue to be below historical levels, but we've got a couple additional dynamics going on in that segment. As we mentioned, we had inventory reductions that are retailers we saw in April and May, and that had a bit of a drag in the quarter, as well as we continue to see demand moderation in cleaning and disinfecting behaviors with consumers. And we think that's going to continue. And so if you look at what we saw in Q4, as we project forward at fiscal or '23, we continue to expect to play out somewhat similar. As we look forward, we feel very good about household essentials and international. I think our pricing will continue to perform well now, I think it's worth noting, we have assumed in our most recent price increase, we took in July, we've assumed elasticities revert back to what we saw historically, which means more negative than we've seen over the previous two price increases, and we just think that's a prudent assumption to make given the pressure consumers have been under and we expect it'll continue to be under going forward. But overall I'd expect on the bulk of our portfolio. You'll see favourable price mix in the high single digit range and volume down likely low single digits, similar to what we saw in Q4. And then I think in the health and wellness segment again, feel very good about our pricing actions. I feel very good about the health of that business. If you look at our home care portfolio, we continue to grow share. We grew share last year. If you look particularly our wipes business, I think we've grown share for the last six quarters and so the business itself is very healthy, but we have to recognize, we expect to continue to see some moderation and share behavior and that'll play out in the category. So we expect that category to be down but our business is quite healthy within this category. Peter Grom : Thanks so much. I'll pass it on. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira - JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good afternoon. So I want to go back to the assumptions of the minus future plus three organic growth and I know I appreciate that you had to be to provide a wide range. So you just discussed now that the pricing that is embedded and I'm assuming that is a fixed part a price mix would be about high single. So it implies that you'd think at the bottom of the range that you have, a minus 6%-ish if you will, like 5%, 6% in volumes and then conversely, a more healthy environment on the top range. So just to kind of pause here and think what are you embedding there? It's still mostly on the health and wellness, the cleaning division that you expect that to be down, or you're also embedding declines in the other component. And I have a follow up on the cost side, the $400 million that you were expecting, is that based on spot or you're also using the curve as you normally do? Kevin Jacobsen : Hi Andrea and thanks for the question. In regard to our sales outlook on organic sales growth of minus 3% to plus 3%, that assumes very similar to what Peter and I were talking about, good solid performance on our household essentials and international portfolio that I expect positive sales growth there. I do expect our health and wellness segment to be down for the year. And that's primarily driven by the demand moderation we expect particularly including disinfecting. And folks you have to remember if you think about the lapse we have this year, last year in both Q1 and to a lesser extent, Q3, we had both the Delta and Omicron variant spreading in the US, and we had very strong performance in the prior year. So we have to lap that in addition to some moderating consumer behaviors, and as a result of that we think the health and wellness segment will be down in sales for the year, but that's really driven by the category much less. So based on the strength of our business. Just Andrea, as as an example, if you think about Q1 last year, very strong performance for cleaning and disinfecting business. And in fact, our wipess business on a unit basis, that business was up over 50% in Q1 of last year. So we have to lap that, and you may have seen my prepared remarks as a result of that, we think our, our cleaning and disinfecting business will be down double digits in Q1, and why we think overall sales for the company will be down high single digits. It's really driven by the lap of Q1 in the previous year and then we expect to see stronger performance as we move forward. And then on the $400 million worth of input costs, we're projecting this year we base that on what we expect not just on spot rates, but looking forward where we expect commodities to migrate over the course of the year. And as we think about how that will phase into our results, we expect cost inflation, be the highest at the beginning of the year, and then moderate as we move through the year. Andrea Teixeira : That's super helpful. Just a follow up on that like, what is your visibility, as you said, like we use forward curves, but you have some visibility into the first half, correct? Kevin Jacobsen : We do. Yes. Andrea Teixeira : So the only thing that's really more forward is more the second half. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. I'd be careful that we, we have visibility to forward curves for many of our commodities, but keep in mind the level of volatility that we continue to see while there's many outside resources, that project commodity inflation and, and forward curves, I have found in this environment, they are difficult to use as certainty. We've seen quite a bit of variability on, on the services we use, and I think that's true for most folks. And so we have visibility to what we believe how com will play out over the course of the year, but I'm a bit cautious with suggesting that we have certain in the first six months. Andrea Teixeira : Yeah, that's fair. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo and Company. Your line is open. Chris Carey : Hey everyone. Can I just confirm that just the commentary around sales that you expect the health and wellness business, sales to be down for the year, but the rest of the business is to be up. So, I just wanted to confirm these prior lines of questioning. And then, just from a gross margin perspective, you've given some good detail around the makings of the bridge for fiscal '23. Kevin, I wonder if you could perhaps provide a bit more context on the contributing factors between pricing, volume deleverage, you noted $400 million of cost inflation. Is that all commodities or are there other non-commodity cost buckets within that? Any promotional activity, transportation, logistics, you see what I'm getting at? I wonder if you could just maybe contextualize some of these key buckets and where you see the most risk or not. Kevin Jacobsen : Hi, Chris. Yeah. Happy to provide some additional insights into the -- where we see the cost inflation occurring and our plans to grow margin. On your sales question, though you are correct, our expectations to help and wellness segment will decline this year offset by growth over the rest of our portfolio. And again, as I mentioned, feel very good about the overall health of our business, but recognize as both lapping the strong performance we had last year, plus the moderating demand by consumers and cleaning disinfecting that that'll have a negative impact on the category for the year. In regard to the cost inflation the $400 million I mentioned is cost inflation across the entire supply chain. That includes commodities, transportation, wage inflation. We are expecting broad based inflation across the entire supply chain, and in regards to what we're doing to offset that is, as you folks know, and we've talked quite a bit about this, our commitment remains that we intend to get back to a pre-pandemic level of gross margin. We lost about 800 basis points last year. And our goal is to build that back over time. As we've said, I think very clearly we don't expect to do that in one year, but we expect to make progress this year and then we'll continue to work at that. We are pulling every lever available to us. And so Chris, you think about the areas that we're pursuing that will drive that benefit this year for us, the, the biggest lever we're pulling is pricing. We have executed now three pricing actions. Two went into effect last year. The third price increase just went into effect last month, that'll have the biggest benefit we expect on our cost structure this year in the 500 to 600 basis point range. We expect to get a benefit this year. A little higher in the front half as that pricing build and as we start to lapse on the actions we took last year, it'll start to dissipate a bit. We're also driving our cost savings program. And we expect to have a very strong year this year. It's been more difficult over the past two years, given the work we've been doing to try to keep up with demand. As demand is moderating and we've been working on our supply chain, we have more opportunity to drive cost savings within our supply chain. So I expect to have a very strong year this year in that 150 basis point to 175 basis points range. And so those would be the two biggest drivers of helping us rebuild margins. And then that's going to be offset by ongoing cost inflation, both in commodities, manufacturing, logistics, and then you may have seen it Chris and our prepared remarks. But the other item I point out is while we expect to improve gross margins, we're talking about 200 basis points this year, I think you'll see that build as we move through the year. We're gonna be most challenged in Q1 given the decline in the top line, and that has an operating de-leveraging impact on margins and to expect our gross margins to be about 35% in the first quarter, but they not expect to build as we move through the year with the expectation we're going to be approaching about 40 basis points by the time we get to the end of the year. And for perspective, we've lost about eight margin points last year, our run rate, as we get through the year, we think we'll put about half of that back on as we move into fiscal year 24. And again, we may remain committed to continue to pursue margin expansion beyond this year. Chris Carey : Thank you very much for that, Kevin. This should be a quick one, but the health and wellness declines you're expecting, can you just offer a quick comment on the professional business clearly, quite challenged this year, are you expecting that to continue or as we've normalized, the sales base you expect that business to get back to growth next year. So thanks for all that. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. Chris, on our professional products division, I'd say overall, we expect modest growth. I think that'll build as we move through the era as we get past some of the comps and we get back to sort of a new level of performance. And particularly as you think about occupancies and professional environments starting to pick up, we think over time, we'll get back to growing that business and likely in the back half of this year and then growing overall for the year. Chris Carey : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kaumil Gajrawala : Thank you everybody. Can you talk a bit more about the streamlining program and maybe more specifically, what you'll be doing differently how we should be thinking about what impact it may or may not have in the short run on, on top line. And when we think about you raising your long term algorithm to 3% to 5% on the top line in the context of what we're now seeing, is there something we should be just thinking about in terms of your ability to achieve that over the long run? Linda Rendle : Sure. Hi Kaumil, I'll start with the streamlining. So, this is our next step in one of our strategic choices connected to our ignite strategy, which is to reimagine work. And back when we released our strategy in 2019, we articulated that we wanted to be a faster and simpler company, and this is the next evolution in that. We're already a pretty efficient company, but we think we can be even more efficient. And these changes will help us meet that algorithm, that sales growth target of 3% to 5% and growing profitably over time as we return margins back to their pre-pandemic state. And what we're really trying to do through this model is get closer to the customer and closer to the consumer so that we can anticipate their needs better, move more quickly and have the entire organization focused on the business unit priorities and having end to end visibility. We expect to implement this beginning in fiscal year 23 coming up here in the end of Q1. We expect to save $75 million to a $100 million over the two years that we'll implement this, that will be an annual savings once we have it fully implemented. And we, over time, the combination of this with our digital transformation will really set us up for that goal of having an organization that moves much faster, much more simple and will support getting, we're targeting about 13% as a percent of sales from an S&A perspective with those two initiatives combined over time. Kaumil Gajrawala : Got it. And this is separate from your typical productivity savings. I'm sorry about that. But, in your gross margin bridge, you often give the benefit of savings. This is separate and additional correct. Linda Rendle : That's right, Kaumil. This is incremental to that. You want to move to the question on long term on 3% to 5%. So, on the 3% to 5%, we still remain committed to that and we see line of sight to that, but it's not going to be linear to get there and Kevin did a good job articulating what some of the factors are that we're dealing with in the short term. And it really has to do with demand, normalization and lapping COVID impact. Back a year ago, we thought that COVID was that the worst of it was behind us before we entered fiscal year '22. We thought inflation was transitory. And that has turned out to be a much longer headwind that we're facing. And if you look at what we experienced from COVID last year, as Kevin said, we had two of the biggest COVID waves, both Delta and Omicron impacting our business. So we have to lap that and get to a more normalized state. We expect that to happen over the course of fiscal year '23, we have some other businesses that are doing some normalization. Kingsford is a good example. It's one of our fastest growing businesses and that's normalizing. But really health and wellness is the biggest portion of that. And as Kevin articulated, we expect the broad portfolio to be growing. And we expect health and wellness to be down next year as a result of this normalization. But as we look at what we delivered, for example, in Q4 our businesses from our organic sales growth perspective, X the health and wellness segment grew 5% so well within our algorithm. If you take a step back and look at the last three years, our business is in aggregate averaged 5% CAGR over that period of time from a growth. So we are in a period of normalization, that's the biggest factor, but we remain confident in our ability to deliver the 3% to 5% and are really happy with the strength of our brands right now 75% of our portfolio deems superior by consumers pricing is going as planned. And we anticipate that it will continue to go as planned in the early insights that we have as we've implemented our third round in July. And what we're just watching really closely is the consumer and watching this environment for them and we will make adjustments to our plans as needed, but we're heading into the period with strong brands, rebuilding margins, so that we can continue to invest and we're just gonna be as nimble as we can to react to a, a really volatile changing environment. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jason English : Hey folks, thanks for slot me. Kevin, the $400 million of incremental cost pressure, I think you said is not just commodities, but it's supply chain as well. A, can you confirm that? And, and B yeah, I think many of us myself included were expecting to see a very big offset come as you in-sourced a lot of the product. Does that $400 million include that offset or is that offset captured somewhere else? Kevin Jacobsen : Hi, Jason. Yeah. Thanks for the question. The $400 million does include supply chain inflation broadly across the entire supply chain, not just commodities. And so that will be, we're looking at increased transportation cost, increased wage cost. We have built in the savings as we've exited these contract manufacturing agreements. We've now stepped out of all the agreements that we intend to step out of. It is contributing to our growing gross, our plan to grow gross margins this year. And so really our pricing actions, our cost savings, plus stepping outta these, these arrangements are all contributing to offsetting the cost inflation we're dealing with beyond the cost inflation though, the other item impacting manufacturing logistics is volume de-leveraging. So as we're taking quite a bit of pricing volume will be down for the year that does have some negative impact on manufacturing, logistics, but it's being offset to a certain degree by the exiting of those co back agreements. So that has all included in our bridge. Jason English : Understood. That's helpful. And I have a lot of questions, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to burn one on, on a simple modeling math question, because I've loaded up my model here and I'm still having a hard time getting down to your EPS that you've guided to despite seemingly getting like the gross margin, the other spend levels, right. Interest expense is the last variable. Like what are you assuming on interest expense and do you have a sharp uptick coming with maybe with the higher rates? Kevin Jacobsen : We don't Jason, we just recently refinanced debt maturities coming due over the next several years. And so this last quarter we called $1.1 billion in debt refinanced that at a slightly lower interest rate, a, a modest savings in terms of interest expense. The other thing I might point to on a reported basis, if you look at other income and expense, typically we have about $30 million to $40 million worth of charges related to intangible amortization. And then related to the operating model redesign we talked about today we baked in about $35 million worth of restructuring charges that will show up in other income and expense as well. It's about $0.20 as our estimate. So that may be something else you'll look at in your model. Operator : [Operator instructions] And we have a question from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Dara Mohsenian : Can you talk a little bit about pricing from here? Obviously you've implemented some pricing this summer that hasn't been realized through the P&L yet, so that's to come, but as you look going forward, are there plans for any incremental pricing, just given the gross margin aggression over a three year period, even with the rebound expected in the upcoming fiscal year. And how do you think about that line item going forward in terms of price increases versus maybe mix pack, size changes, etcetera? Linda Rendle : Sure. Just a reminder for everyone. We just implemented our third significant round of pricing in July, and that is flowing through now to your point and is on track to our expectations. And that was our largest price increase of the three that we have taken over the last 12 months. And, and it's on track. We do anticipate taking additional pricing as part of our plan and that will come in different forms, whether that be truckload increases or price pack architecture, which will start to begin in more earnest in fiscal year '23, as we've discussed before. And what we're watching right now is the reaction to July. It's too early to tell that is just hitting the market now and, and we'd want to get through a purchase cycle with the consumer to see how they're reacting. And as Kevin highlighted, we had seen our historical price elasticities, not play out over this last year. They were slightly better than that historical elasticity that we had experienced, but we're expecting that to return in fiscal year '23. So elasticity slightly worse and better in line with what we saw pre-COVID given the level of pricing and given what's going on with the consumer. So we'd anticipate they will, they will continue to be on track. Our categories remain healthy, but we're gonna watch that very closely and we will adjust any plans that we have as needed to address that. But, largely we expect to continue to use pricing as a lever to grow gross margin, not only through July, but through the course of the year. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. Thanks. And then just a detailed question, the streamlined operating model, how much savings do you have embedded in guidance in fiscal '23? Is that savings more likely to play out in fiscal '24 or is there a decent chunk of it in fiscal '23? Kevin Jacobsen : Hi Dara, as you may have seen, we are projecting $75 million to a $100 million of savings over the next 18 months to 24 months. We are expecting about $25 million worth of savings this year as we begin the program. And then that'll continue in fiscal year '24. And in terms of, as you're sort of modeling it as you're modeling both the onetime restructuring charge, typically those charges come first. So I expect more restructuring charges in the front half the year, and then the savings start to occur in the back half of the year and then continue into next year. Operator : We have a question from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is open. Kevin Grundy : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to pick up on, on trade down risk Linda, I think you mentioned a handful of times about how the consumer is behaving and then, and we see that right. And increasingly I think across the categories, as we look at the syndicated data for Clorox, we're seeing private label pickup share across all of your key categories, trash bags, bleach wipes, salad, dressing, charcoal etcetera. I think a notable nuance with this has also been the price gaps have narrowed given some of the timing in terms of when you have moved versus private label as well. So we've seen some of the share loss or share gains for private label while, while price gaps have narrowed for Clorox versus private label, which is a bit perverse. And I think Kevin, you're also made the comment, that you expect, with some of this pricing that the price gaps will return to more normal levels. So, so that is to suggest that the price gaps will, will widen, which then, in theory for more, more price conscious consumer could, could perpetuate, some of the share issues that you've seen in your portfolio. So that's all sort of a big wind up Linda, I guess, for how worried, how did you contemplate what you're seeing with the consumer and some of these dynamics as you pulled together the outlook, maybe just comment, updated thoughts on trade down risk, where you are with price gaps, where you think you're gonna land et cetera. Thank you. Linda Rendle : Sure. Kevin, thanks for the question. So maybe we start with your private label share question and, and talk a little bit about what we're seeing there and we can get into the broader piece around, what does that mean and what are we seeing more broadly in trade down? So as we've spoken about before the dynamics. As you look at any time period in scanner data, right now, it's difficult to parse out because you have many factors depending on the category. Normalization, the timing of pricing, which you already hit on, which is exactly right. Supply normalization, etcetera. So I would caution that looking at any small portion of time to get to a conclusion one way or the other, have to get in to a bit of the nuances. As it relates to private label and our categories, a good portion of that is the timing gap in pricing. So we've seen private label go a little faster in some of our categories. You call that out and it's true in trash and bleach in particular. In wipes, it is more about normalization and so wipes in that time period for Q4 private label grew five share points, we grew six. So it's not coming from us. And if you look at charcoal, another example where there's a different nuance, we grew share all outlets as consumers move to some channels and bought some larger sizes even though we were down slightly in Lulo. So I think again, just speaks to the dynamic nature of what we're experiencing right now, and you're right, as we return our price gaps to more normalized levels, which we continue to expect. And as we implement our July price increase, that is in market now. And again, as a reminder is our largest price increase. We do expect to be back to more normalized price gaps, and you'll start to see that flow through and share. Right now we have very strong volume shares for example, and we expect that to translate to dollar share as that flows through. And then, your larger question on trade down, we are not seeing any significant trade down as it relates to trading into private label. Given the dynamics I just covered, I think that's clear that there's some other things going on there, but we are seeing some trade down within our own portfolio, for example, and we would've anticipated and expected this, and we're working this as part of our sales plan. So for example, we're seeing consumers move to some opening price points. They still want the branded player, but they are, don't have a lot of out of pocket and so they're buying a smaller size. We're also seeing consumers trade up to larger sizes to get the very best price per ounce. And we're working with retailers to ensure our assortment is right to capture that. We've seen that in other times of in inflation and recession and so we've been proactive about addressing that with our retailer partners to ensure that we have the right distribution. And of course, as we are widely distributed across all channels who are ready as consumers move and ensure that that they have their right level of value. So at this moment, what I would say is, we are seeing some change in consumer behavior. It's largely what we would anticipate. We are not seeing a big change into private label at this moment. Again, we're focusing on the things that we can control here. Ensuring our innovation program continues to activate in the market. We continue to spend on our brands, we'll spend 10% of sales on advertising and sales promotion next year. And we're proactively working with our retailers on tailored shopper plans to ensure that we're offering the right value for the moment, depending on where the consumer is. And it's something, again, we'll watch very closely and we'll adjust our plans as needed if it, it starts to go in a different direction. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays Investment Bank. Your line is open. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks so much. Thank you. I had two sets of questions. The first thing is just on the SG&A and as you're talking about targeting a lower ratio over time and this kind of restructuring program that you're initiating. It strikes me that if anything, it has felt like perhaps Clorox has been more on the side of underinvested, not overinvested. The company's been, made a hallmark of running lean go lean was a program and that's been an approach. And so if anything, and maybe I'm off base on this, it's felt like part of the problem has been being too lean that hasn't afforded you, the visibility you've needed, the flexibility you've needed. And yet part of this plan going forward is to get more lean on SG&A. So I would just be curious on, on reactions to that and then I have a question on cash flow. Thanks. Linda Rendle : Sure. Hi Lauren. So, as we think about just our investment and, and how this fits into the overall picture that we're trying to drive with Ignite, we were really clear and Ignite that we needed to be simpler and faster. That was a key choice that we made under the headline of reimagined work. And we also said we needed to invest strongly in our business. And we took that another step further when we announced the technology transformation that we're undergoing and the $500 million investment we're making in that program over the next several years, in addition, we've continued to invest strongly linear brands. We've invested in innovation and innovation as a larger contributor than it was in the prior strategy period. So I feel like we were making all of the right investments to ensure that we have strong brands with our consumers, and that is playing out in our consumer value measure. And we expect to play out over the mid to long term and share, certainly this quarter, wasn't the share performance we want to deliver, but we feel like we're headed in the right direction, but when it comes to this piece and what we want to do with the operating model, we want to make sure that we are always operating as efficiently as we can and putting the dollars where they matter in our business to ensure that we can grow our brands. And we believe very strongly that we can be more simple and fast, and that will help support that 3% to 5% growth rate that we have and restoring margins. We want to cut down on decision time. We wanna ensure that the technology we put in place through our digital transformation is supported by a structure that enables it and uses it as fast as we possibly can to ensure that we're closer to the customer and closer to the consumer. So I think when you step back and take a balanced view, we are making investments in the right spots where we think they have the highest ROI. And we are ensuring that we take all of the necessary actions to reduce costs where we think that ROI is lower and we can operate more efficiently. And I just want to be really clear, I think on your point on Go Lean. Go Lean was not a company initiative, that was an international initiative, and that was very effective for international to ensure that we are reestablished the cost base of international to get to the appropriate level, to grow off of. And you can look at our international performance was very strong this year and that was supported by getting that right structure underneath the business in order for it to grow. So again, as I step back Lauren, I think we have investments in the right place and we are doing everything that we can to restore margins in places where we have a, a lower return on that investment. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. Thank you. That's excellent color. My next question was just on, on cash flow. So I was curious if there's any, Kevin cash flow metrics you could articulate that you're targeting for '23. And just in terms of in inventory, right because inventory days are still quite and I'm just curious, as you think through, obviously a lot of this is going to be tied to cleaning. A lot of this is tied to exiting those, the external supply contracts, but how should we be thinking about inventory days? And, what's the right level, right? You're still in the kind of low sixties and that's significantly higher than where you were pre-COVID. So just how that flows into the gross margin recovery story and '23 or beyond. Thanks. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. Thanks Lauren. For the question, maybe I'll start with inventory then I'll get back to cash flow and our expectations this year. As it relates to inventory I feel good about the progress we are making. If you look at the fourth quarter, we were able to reduce inventory sequentially about 50 million from where we landed in Q3. Now, part of that was what we talked about earlier as we exited these third party manufacturing agreements. And in many cases, we maintained raw materials or finished goods of these facilities. We're able to consolidate those manufacturing nodes and reduce our overall inventory levels and so we made good progress there. I expect this year, we'll continue to make progress on inventory. Now that assumes that we see more normalization in supply chain. Lauren, as we've talked in the past, we've had to hold higher inventory levels to prepare for the ongoing disruptions. We're dealing with our expectations as supply chain will still be challenged, but certainly not to the degree we've experienced over the last 12, 18 months. So as a result, we're gonna be able to pull down our inventory levels broadly across the enterprise. And so I'd expect us to continue to make progress. I like the progress I saw in Q4. I expect that to continue in fiscal '23, which it contribute to reducing our overall working capital. And then I think more broadly about cash. Lauren, I think this year very similar last year, I think in terms of cash provided by operations, we'll be in that $700 million to $900 million range. Now before our margins were under pressure, we were January about a $1 billion. And so I do expect it to be lower than our historical levels because of the reduced profitability we're expecting this year. And then as it relates to CapEx, as we target three to 4% per year. Now we've been a little above that in previous years that we've been making some investments to in increase our, our production capacity for the most part we're through those investments. We have one last plant we're working on where, as you may know, we're preparing to open up a second litter facility, which we'll bring online this year. So we've got a little bit more capital spending there, but I expect we'll be in that three to 4% this year and probably about the midpoint of that range. And so that means is you think about our free cash flow goal. We target 11% to 13%. I expect this year will be below, will be below that goal, probably high single digits as we've got some reduced profitability. And then over our time, I expect to build that back as we improve profitability. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. The great, thanks so much for all the detail. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. Thanks Lauren. Operator : We have a question from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Your line is open. Olivia Tong : You have mentioned earlier that price elasticities have continued to come in better than you expected, but your outlook assumes that, that doesn't continue that they go back to the circle level. So to the extent that you do have some favorability there versus expectations. How do you think about what you do with that? Does it flow through to the P&L? Or is there -- are there projects that you want to do to drive some return free and funds to return to spending? And then just on the gross margin overall, 200 basis points expected for next year, so quarter of the way back, it sounds like you were expecting another quarter in fiscal '24. So is that the way that we should be thinking about the mechanics to get back to where you were before, just sort of like ratably fourth or fourth or fourth or fourth? Linda Rendle : Sure. I'll start with your question on price elasticity. So if we were to experience better than what we expect, which again is more normalized price elasticities to historical pre-COVID then that would be something that we would first look to flow through. And of course, that's because we've made all the investments that we feel we need to make at this time in the year. We're investing in advertising. We have the right promotional spending from what we can see. And of course, if there was anything that were to change that we needed to address, then we would consider that, but we would leverage that in a way to flow through. And I just want to make sure I'm really clear on that. But we'll, of course, have to see given the environment is so volatile if there was anything else to come up, we would correct but that would be the first thing we would look to do. Kevin Jacobsen : And then, Olivia, on your question on gross margin and the pace of the margin recovery, as you mentioned, our expectation is we're going to improve gross margin by 200 basis points. I think important, though, is we expect that to build as we move through the year. And as I said earlier, our expectation is we're going to be close to a 40% gross margin when we end the year. So on a run rate basis, I expect to make fairly good progress this year and be in a position we've recovered a good portion of that margin decline. And then I expect that obviously to continue to '24 where the actions we'll take. Now part of the timing of our pace of margin recovery will be dictated by inflation. I would tell you, we are not waiting for cost deflation is our path to margin recovery. We're pulling every lever available to us between pricing, cost savings, the operating model changes we talked about today, and we'll continue to do that going forward. But obviously, what the direction inflation goes could either accelerate or decelerate that margin recovery. In this environment, it's hard to look beyond this year. with a strong perspective on where costs will be next year. And so that's something we'll probably have to see how it plays out a bit this year to make that call. So I think we're making solid progress this year on our commitment to rebuild margins. We're pulling every lever available to us. And I think it's a bit difficult to pick the exact time period. We'll build it back. I think some of that will be influenced by the external cost environment. As we move through the year, we'll certainly update you as we're thinking about the pace of that change. Olivia Tong : Got it. And then my follow-up is on your thoughts around your trajectory on market share. Perhaps could you talk a little bit about what private label capacity looks like? And specifically in the health and wellness businesses. Obviously, a lot of pretty aggressive pricing and consequently a fair degree of volume degradation associated with that. So to the extent that consumers can first and foremost, stomach this much in terms of pricing, just kind of curious how you how private label capacity and their ability to step in looks as you consider these pricing and what that you're taking? Linda Rendle : Olivia, I can't speak to capacity outside of our own network. I don't think there's a capacity limiter in our categories. That's not as we have spoken about in terms offer. But what I would really return to is what we're seeing in terms of the performance, it was down slightly versus a year ago. We made sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4. And again, I highlighted a few of those area that were due to pricing timing and then some other factors where we grew very strongly, for example, in wipes and private label did as well we were up 6 points, they were up five points from a share perspective. So I don't see any health issue at this point in our home care categories or our cleaning categories. Elasticities, again, are playing out as we define. And I think really, as we look to this, we will expect demand normalization to be the biggest contributing factor and the elasticities will largely play out as we expect. Again, we'll watch that very closely. But this is more about demand normalization than it is about any trade down to private label at this point. Operator : And we have a question from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Steve Powers : I guess, picking up on that thread of demand normalization, Linda. I guess I'm curious as to how you actually go about or have gone about defining what renormalized demand looks like in categories like wipes or cleaning and disinfecting more broadly and maybe how that compares to prepandemic levels? And as you talk about that, maybe you could, if possible, elaborate a bit more on the expected pacing to get there embedded in the outlook? I get the base year comparisons are going to create a lot of year-over-year volatility, but is the normalization process that you're envisioning, is that something that happens all the way through '23? Does it happen faster such that the headwinds are skewed heavily to the first half and the back half is more normal? Just how should we think about that? Linda Rendle : Yes, Steve. On demand normalization we certainly are lapping impacts from COVID, but we're seeing changes in more normal behavior coming from consumers, and we're trying to understand when are we at a new normal. -- and it's more about lapse versus we're at that new normalization state. We saw, as Kevin and I said a couple of times, we're lapping delta right now where wipes were up from a unit base is 50% in our last Q1 and we did see a bump in Q3 as well. And so both of those will be left that we'll have to get through. So we're talking through fiscal year '23, we would expect that normalization. We are still seeing consumer behaviors, if you look at buy rate, et cetera, enhanced, and we're still seeing people care about cleaning and disinfecting elevated, but definitely lower than it was at the height of the pandemic, but higher than it was pre-COVID. So what we're trying to gauge is when does that new consumption pattern align to that desire from consumers who have a heightened state of awareness of cleaning and disinfecting and get into a more normalized routine. The other thing we're going to see how this plays out is cold and flu. Consumers have not experienced a normal cold and flu season since COVID started. So how will that reinforce consumer behaviors, and we'll experience that at the end of Q2 and through Q3. So we'll be watching that very closely. And then, of course, we're in a COVID wave right now. And so we're watching that dynamic as we lap last year's Delta Wave. So I would say we are watching this throughout the year, and we'll give indicators of when we start to see that more normalized demand, but we're looking something between where we were pre-COVID, which we continue to be above that. and what it looks like in a more normalized state when people are more aware and have a heightened concern but yet are getting into a new set of habits and routines. And we'll keep you updated as we see that and when we anticipate being in a more normalized state. But as you can imagine, given what's going on with COVID, et cetera, it is difficult to pinpoint exactly when that will occur. Steve Powers : Yes. Okay. That's all fair. Just one other question, if I could. Going back to the new operating model. I guess I was just curious for a little history on when the initiatives that you've you're rolling out here in '23 and into '24, when those were -- when those began to be contemplated? Just a little bit of history on how these decisions were made? And has this been planned for a while? Is this something that is more of a recent initiative? Just a little color there would be helpful. Linda Rendle : Sure, Steve. This really relates back to the strategic choice we made in Ignite to reimagine work, and we wanted to be simpler and faster. And we always contemplated ways, as you would expect, you expect us to operate efficiently and be removing costs wherever we can. They were always looking at the choices across the ecosystem to say, are we getting the best return on our investment? Are there ways to do things more effectively and efficiently? We did that as we unveiled our digital transformation program. which we really needed to accelerate given the increase in digital behavior behind the pandemics, we moved that up. And as we evaluated the environment that we see now, we want to accelerate the progress we wanted to make on reimagine work by making a more structural change. So that I would say it's at this moment that we think it's the right time to do that. We've got to a bit more of a steady state when it comes to supply chain, still very challenged. We're still having force majeures, etcetera, but it's more manageable. And we think this is the right time to take it on, but it's really a continuation of that vision we laid out in 2019 to be faster and. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle, I would now like to turn the program back to you. Linda Rendle : Thanks again, everyone, for joining us. I look forward to speaking with you again on our next call in November. Until then, please stay well. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. Lisah Burhan : Thank you, Ross. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Linda Rendle, our CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. I hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. In just a moment, Linda will share a few opening comments, and then we'll take your question.  During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, including about our 2023 fiscal year outlook. These statements are based on management's current expectations, but may differ from actual results or outcomes.  In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements, which has been filed with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the non-GAAP financial information section of our earnings release and the supplemental financial schedule in the Investor Relations section of our website for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.  Now I'll turn it over to Linda. Linda Rendle : Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. While the challenging and volatile global operating environment we discussed last quarter persist, we delivered better-than-expected Q1 results, reflecting the strength of our brands, ongoing consumer loyalty and solid execution.  During the quarter, we maintained our unrelenting focus on rebuilding margin by taking additional inflation-driven pricing, delivering cost savings, optimizing our supply chain and implementing our new operating model. At the same time, we continue to invest in our brands, to deliver consumer-inspired innovation with superior value as well as advance our digital transformation to drive top line momentum and position the company for long-term success.  Looking ahead, it's still early in the fiscal year, and we continue to contend with a number of macro headwinds, which we are proactively addressing, and we'll remain agile as the environment evolves. Given these factors, we are reiterating our full year outlook. Nevertheless, guided by our IGNITE Strategy, we remain committed to delivering on our 3% to 5% sales growth target over the long term.  The fundamentals of our business are strong. We plan essential categories and our business is well positioned to benefit from lasting consumer demand tailwinds. I'm confident we're on the right track to generate consistent and profitable growth over time and build a stronger, more resilient company.  With that, Kevin and I will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. Peter Grom : So I wanted to ask a big picture question on kind of the guidance for the year. You mentioned that currency is [ a $0.17 -- $0.17 to adjusted ] EPS. And I know there are varying degrees of views under the level of conservatism embedded in this guidance.  But just when we think about the ability to maintain the earnings range, [ despite in that, what that strategy is about, about the half ] the size of the entire range, is there something that's coming in better to offset that, whether it be underlying growth, commodity costs, et cetera? Or is kind of the right way to think about the updated currency impact is that you now expect to kind of be at the lower end of that earnings range? Kevin Jacobsen : Hey, Peter. Thanks for the question on guidance. Let me provide a perspective. And what I'd tell you, at a high level, I feel our guidance is very balanced and it is where we expect to land the year.  If I think about some of the puts and takes where we're at, as you saw in our prepared remarks, we had a good solid start to the year that exceeded our expectations, what we shared with you about a quarter ago. And so we feel very good about the start of the year.  At the same time, we are dealing with some additional headwinds, FX being one. But as Linda also mentioned, we've got a couple of supply disruptions on a couple of our businesses that we're working through. And so I'd say, a good start to the year. We've got a couple issues we're dealing with, but by and large, feel like we remain on track.  I think what's also important, Peter, as we think about -- you had mentioned inflation, I would say inflation is generally playing out as we expected. We said at the beginning of the year, it was about $400 million of the cost, inflation in the supply chain. We still expect about that same amount. Although I would tell you, when we started the year, we were a little below $400 million. We're a little above right now. So it's gotten a little bit worse.  As we've been doing through the entire pandemic, we are making the appropriate adjustments to our plans. We've done that. And as a result, we feel good that we're on track for our outlook. Peter Grom : And I guess, I had just one follow-up on the kind of the organic sales outlook. I know, previously, a lot of the weakness was expected to occur in Health and Wellness, and you were expecting to see continued momentum across the rest of the business.  In the first quarter, obviously, Health and Wellness came in better than you were anticipating, and it seems like, at least from our perspective, that the other segments [ all with ] weaker performance. So just like any thoughts or updated thoughts on how to think about the building blocks for the organic sales outlook from a segment perspective? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, Peter, you're right. As you think about Q1 versus our expectations, our Health and Wellness segment came in better, behind the strength of Cleaning and Disinfecting. That business outperformed our expectations based a on very successful back-to-school merchandising program primarily.  And then, as you said, if you look at the rest of our portfolio, we had anticipated stronger organic growth. It came in a little bit below our expectations, really driven by the supply disruptions in our Burt's Bees and our Glad business unit. If those 2 businesses had delivered against our expectations, we would have delivered about 3% organic growth on the rest of our portfolio, ex Health and Wellness. But clearly, these are some new issues, that we've been dealing with this for the last 3 years. Supply chain disruptions are nothing new. We're dealing with it in these 2 businesses. We expect to get those worked out this quarter. And by the back half of the year, I'd expect those businesses are back to shipping, back to our expectations. So I think it will drag a little bit in the second quarter as a result of that, and then I expect stronger performance in the back half of the year as we get those resolved. Operator : And our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : So my question would be on kind of like how you see shipments against consumption. And obviously, Health and Wellness was coming in better than anticipated. How should we be thinking of retailers taking in inventory potentially ahead of the price increases or anything on that sense in the other ones? And how, conversely, on your point, Kevin, about not being able to fulfill some of the other parts of the business and would have been a better outcome of 3%, like how should we be thinking about consumption against inventory? And as you try to fulfill, is that something that you may have missed in terms of the sets and the seasonal impacts of that going forward, especially for Charcoal and Litter as we move into the quarters? Linda Rendle : Hi, Andrea. Thanks for the question. So generally, we saw in Q1 minimal impact from any type of inventory effect going either way. We did have a couple of businesses that we saw retailers make some inventory adjustments actually on the other side. We call that vitamins, minerals and supplements as one of them, Charcoal as another. And we look at that as a very normal inventory changes, no impact to the consumer or impact to consumption, but retailers continue to optimize their inventory levels. We did not see a mismatch between consumption and shipments going the other way, where we see inventories rising at retail. But we continue to see that's going to be dynamic. Retailers are making adjustments, adjusting to the new volumes they're seeing in the categories. So we're watching that as we move forward, but again, would not be any type of strategic impact. It would simply be shifts in timing versus any other type of concern that we would have. So at this point, we think we're at about the right inventory levels across all of our businesses, and again, minimal impact in Q1 and do not anticipate a sizable impact moving forward in our outlook. Andrea Teixeira : And just if I can follow up on the margin. Kevin, you mentioned then that there was an impact on volume deleverage this quarter. But as you move forward, you're still expecting the 200 basis points improvement in gross margin as we navigate through this $400 million that you called out being a little bit higher than initial and then FX.  Is there anything that you can comment, perhaps more pricing that you can use as offsets? And I understand, of course, you're going to start to lap and have a better -- in the first quarter with a very good start from that perspective. Just trying to see the cadence and what to expect going forward. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure, Andrea. And you're correct. We still expect to deliver about 38% gross margin for the full year. That would be up about 200 basis points versus a year ago. And as we've said, this continues to be a very dynamic environment.  As conditions change, we continue to adjust our plans as appropriate, to maintain our plans for the full year. I'll just give you one example. As we've seen the FX environment become more difficult, as we talked about, and we're seeing higher inflation in a number of countries where we operate, we've gone back and adjusted our [ pricing plans ] in our international markets.  That's an example where we're going back and making appropriate plan changes to address the changing macro environment. And through those changes, we're able to keep our plans on track for the year. Operator : And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : So obviously, very strong price mix in the quarter at 13%. You did take pricing later than some competitors and more aggressively at this point in time at least. So can you just talk about the consumer reaction that you're seeing so far, the retailer reaction and also just what you're seeing from competitors in terms of price gaps? And just give us a sense of also what's left to come going forward on the pricing front in terms of increases from here. Linda Rendle : Sure. Happy to, Dara. So pricing is on track. And as you noted, we've taken multiple rounds of pricing, with a third round in market effective in July. And we are seeing elasticity largely in line with our expectations. And that has been early in the year, slightly favorable to what they were pre-COVID, but we're starting to see them drift towards our pre-COVID elasticities as we had anticipated. Our categories remain healthy and resilient. And our price gaps have returned to pre-pandemic levels for most brands.  Given the pressures that Kevin spoke about in terms of cost, we are taking an additional round of pricing in December, which will be our fourth major round of pricing. We don't anticipate that round to be as deep or broad as the July pricing, which was the largest of the 4 that we will take to date. And we anticipate that we'll be leading in many of the categories that we're taking pricing in, in December.  And as Kevin said, we're going to continue to be nimble and adjust. But at this point, consumer resilience, elasticity, is in line with expectations, and price gaps where we would expect them to be. Dara Mohsenian : Great. And then it sounded like market share is coming in better than expected perhaps on the Cleaning side, with the merchandising around back-to-school, et cetera. So can you just talk about what you're seeing from a market share standpoint on that side of the business and what you're expecting going forward? Linda Rendle : Sure. And maybe I'll just broaden the comment on share overall. We're making progress on share, but we have more work to do. And supply disruptions have been part of that, going on in our Household Essentials business.  But we were happy to continue to see the momentum in Cleaning, as you note. We've grown share consistently now quarter after quarter, and that continued with the strong performance that we had in back-to-school, as you noted.  We grew all-outlet share in our 4 largest businesses. So that's Home Care, Glad, Food and Charcoal, which was great to see. But as I've said many times, I expect to grow share in aggregate, and we're not quite there yet. But we'll continue to see progress as pricing flows through in December and as our distribution plans continue to take hold. But we feel good about the progress, but the work is not done yet on share. Operator : And our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo. Christopher Carey : Can I just maybe ask maybe more of a conceptual question about gross margins? Kevin, I think you noted that your commodity -- or that the cost basket of $400 million was trending slightly below $400 million before, and now, it's trending above $400 million. So I wonder if you could just maybe offer some additional context on the complexion of that cost basket, perhaps between commodity and noncommodity? And maybe layering on to that, just the concept of, certainly, there's a view, which I think you've talked about yourselves, that the gross margins of this business should continue to improve at a progressive rate over the next few years.  And I just wonder what you think about the durability of some of these cost increases that you've seen, specifically on the noncommodity side, which continue to linger. And how much pricing do you think you might need to take or cost savings that you would need to execute in order to achieve your longer-term objectives on the margin line? Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. Thanks, Chris, for the question. And let me start with the overall basket of cost increases we're looking at. And as you mentioned, we started the year expecting about $400 million, a little below. We've updated that with this most recent outlook, and we're rolling up to a little bit over $400 million, but generally, still in that area. What hasn't really changed for us is commodity inflation overall. It represents about half that total inflation. While we've seen a little bit of change by item [ we purchased ], the general level of inflation in the commodities is pretty consistent with what we thought about a quarter ago. So no real change there.  We've seen a little bit of improvement on resin prices, and then there's a few other areas in chemicals and ag products that have gone a little bit the other way. But puts and takes, but by and large, our commodity inflation expectation is consistent with what we thought earlier this year.  Where we are seeing a little bit higher prices is primarily in logistics, and I'm sure you folks are seeing what's going on with the price of diesel. That's coming in higher than we anticipated. So we revised up a bit our expectation on logistics cost inflation. So we're still operating in generally that $400 million range, but a little bit higher cost we're expecting in logistics for the balance of the year. In terms of how I expect the gross margins to phase going forward, I think this is an important inflection point for us. As you know, margins declined for about 5 straight quarters given the tremendous cost inflation we're dealing with last year, as you recall, about $800 million worth of cost inflation in the supply chain.  We stabilized margins in Q4. They were essentially flat year-over-year. As you saw this most recent quarter, gross margin down about 100 basis points, primarily for the charge we took on the Pine-Sol recall. Excluding that charge, they are generally flat year-over-year again. And we expect to start growing this quarter. As you saw in my prepared remarks, we expect 100 to 200 basis points of margin expansion.  So I think this is an important inflection point. We're getting back now to starting to rebuild margins that we've been working on for a while. I expect that to continue as we move through the balance of this year. As we said, we expect to grow margins about 200 basis points for full year, but I expect that to build starting from Q2 as we move forward.  And then your longer-term question, Linda and I and the entire leadership team remain committed to rebuilding margins to pre-pandemic levels. And we said that's going to take a while. It's difficult to predict exactly when we'll be able to achieve that because a lot of that is outside of our control. I feel very good about the things we control, the pricing we're executing, the cost savings program, and our supply chain optimization work is all very much on track. But the reality is, the cost environment continues to be very dynamic.  At some point, I expect cost to roll over. These are cyclical commodities. But it's difficult to know when that will occur. And that will likely either accelerate or delay the time of our margin recovery based on outside events.  And then on the cost buckets outside of commodities, when you look at logistics and manufacturing, there are some of those costs that I think will stick. When you look at labor, I expect those costs will continue going forward. But there's other elements, diesel, things of that nature, I do expect also to see come down at some point. And so we'll have to see exactly how that plays out. But what I feel good about is we're starting to make progress on our commitment to start rebuilding margins. That starts for us this quarter. And I would expect that to continue as we move through the year. Christopher Carey : Just one quick follow-up would be, and this would be for Linda or Kevin, but Professional business was flat, I believe, in the quarter, which seems like finally seeing some stabilization. I wonder if you could just add some context of what you're seeing in the business and how it factors into your plans for this year. Linda Rendle : Yes, it was about flat, and we take that as a good sign as well. We are seeing continued headwinds on that business as it relates to return to office and some of the things that affect our janitorial business.  But we are seeing some return to office, which is good from a sales perspective as well as hospitals getting into a more normalized routine, where they're using our products to clean in between procedures, et cetera.  Now from here, we're focused on ensuring that we have the right sales plans, that we're working with businesses and janitorial services to ensure that they have the right protocols and hospitals as well. So we expect, again, over the long term, that business to be an outsized contributor to the company. But certainly, I would say, at this point, we're happy to see it flat again and hope to return to growing here over the coming quarters. Operator : And our next question comes from Javier Escalante from Evercore. Javier Escalante Manzo : I have 2 questions. One, business planning for Kevin. And if I have a follow-up, to Linda, more strategically on the business planning. If we look at retail [ sourcing in this kind of data ], we see volumes weakening, so it's high teens.  So in that context, if you could tell us what is your second quarter assumption between volumes and pricing and how you distinguish what is normalization of demand versus elasticities given that you are taking more pricing in the December quarter. And then I have a follow-up. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. Javier, on Q2, and I'm not going to give a full detailed outlook for Q2, we've tried to provide some color to be helpful for modeling purposes, we do expect top line to be down low single digits on a reported basis. And we continue to expect about 2 points of FX headwinds. So you should assume organic sales growth is about 2 points better than our reported sales, which are expected to be down in that low single-digit range.  I expect Q2, in general, like somewhat similar to Q1. I expect ongoing normalization in our Cleaning and Disinfecting portfolio. Now not to the same extent that you saw in Q1, where we're lapping the Delta variant, but we do expect some ongoing normalization in that portfolio. And then, as we mentioned, we've got a few supply chain disruptions we're working through. I think that will impact Q2, similar to what we saw in Q1, and we're going to -- we expect to get those resolved as we move into the back half of the year. And so overall, I think as you look at volume-price-mix, I would not expect it to be that different than what we saw in the first quarter. Javier Escalante Manzo : So down double digits, the volume for second quarter? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, I'd expect so, because that's probably playing out based on elasticities. And maybe a broader point that's helpful to comment on. As you think about the elasticities in our portfolio, generally, our expectation when we take pricing based on the normal elasticities is you don't generate much incremental revenue from that pricing. We are taking pricing to address the cost inflation. It's not necessarily a source of revenue growth.  And so I would expect, if elasticity is played out as we expect, I would see volume decline similar to what we saw in Q1, maybe a little bit better because of less demand normalization in Cleaning and Disinfecting, but still have volume declines generally offsetting the price mix by generating -- starting to generate very nice savings to gross margin.  I think you saw, in Q1, we generated over 500 basis points of margin expansion through pricing. I'd expect to build on that in Q2 because we'll get the full impact of the July price increase, plus a modest impact of December pricing we're taking as well. Javier Escalante Manzo : That's great, Kevin. And more strategically, to Linda. I'm kind of refamiliarizing myself with Clorox, and I'm a little bit surprised about how significant investment in ERP is.  Most of your businesses are U.S.-centric. Many of your categories, the main competitor is private label. So essentially, there is more of a cost issue, low-cost base kind of situation. Your cost base is getting higher. So why do you need that investment in digitalization. These are now beauty companies. This is Charcoal, Bleach, trash bags. Help us understand the rationale of that investment. Linda Rendle : Javier, our digital transformation is much larger than just implementing a new ERP, which we need to. Our ERP is well over 20 years old, and that's the foundation of how we run our business. But what we're trying to do is modernize our digital infrastructure to maximize our ability to grow and maximize our efficiency. So the technology we're investing in is not just foundational, but it allows us to move faster on innovation. Leverage the data, the enormous amount of data that we have, across our ecosystem to get to insights and be able to grow our categories, to be able to generate savings by knowing exactly where the costs are in our supply chain and being able to remove the ones that are not value-added.  So this digital transformation supports that 3% to 5% growth we're talking about. And we expect that value to begin to happen at the end of the strategy period and beyond that to set us up for the next period.  And then, of course, from an ERP perspective, we do have businesses in over 100 countries, so we'll be rolling out this ERP across the world to ensure that we can run our business. But this is much bigger than just putting in the base technology. This is really about digitizing for the future. Operator : And our next question comes from Anna Lizzul from Bank of America. Anna Lizzul : I wanted to follow up on pricing. You mentioned you're taking more pricing in December. So it seems then that you feel comfortable that retailers and consumers can absorb this additional pricing. If you can comment on recent trends, are you seeing any bifurcation in consumer appetite for Clorox products with higher-end consumers, more stable, versus lower-end consumers trading down or out of the brand? Linda Rendle : I would say our consumer and our categories remain very resilient through the 3 rounds of pricing that we have taken. And the pricing elasticity has played out just as we expected. And to be clear, that is slightly favorable than it was. Those elasticities were pre-COVID, but we're starting to see them drift to more normalized elasticities as we expected. We are not seeing any material signs of trade down from our brands to private label or to other brands. We're watching that closely, and we'll adapt our plans if we need to if that changes. But what we are seeing is consumers broadly seeking value type of behaviors, and that's happening within our portfolio. And we talked a little bit about this last quarter, and this is expected. So we're seeing consumers shop more heavily in value channels, for example. So they're moving to club and dollar and mass.  We're seeing them look for different ways to explore value through sizing. So maybe buying at an opening price point, if they just have a low out-of-pocket availability from a cash standpoint, or they're trying to get the very best value per ounce or use and they're going with larger sizes.  We've seen things like trip frequency increase, where people are spending a little bit less on each trip, but they are coming more frequently. And this is very typical value-seeking behavior from consumers at this point. And what I'd say is, actually, our low-income consumer in our brands is holding up even more strongly than general population, and we've seen stronger household penetration from low-income consumers, which is consistent with what we believe is that, in this time, the highest value with low-income consumer becomes even more important, and our brands are superior value.  And that's, of course, measured with the fact that the largest portion of our portfolio is deemed superior by consumers than it ever has before since we've been again measuring it. So we're in a very good spot. We expect the December price increase to go largely as the last 3 have gone. But we're monitoring it really closely. We'll expect the environment to continue to be bumpy, and we'll expect consumers to continue to have more stress put on them. But given the categories we compete on, Household Essentials, everyday products that they need, we feel very well-positioned to be able to take another round of pricing. Anna Lizzul : Great. That's very helpful. And just as a follow-up, given that you've exited certain private-label contracts, how do you feel about your inventory levels going forward? Kevin Jacobsen : Anna, I think you're talking about our contract manufacturing agreements, is that right? Anna Lizzul : Right. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, you're exactly right. So as you may recall, we increased the use of contract manufacturers during the pandemic to help meet the increased demand for our products. [ We knew ] that was [ temporary to normalize ]. We have stepped out of those agreements. We did that at the end of last year. And then what we've said is we've been holding higher safety stock inventory levels to help build more resiliency into our supply chain to manage through the ongoing disruptions we're experiencing. As those disruptions start to level out our expectations, we're going to be able to bring inventory levels down as we have more reliability in our supply chain.  I would say the supply chain is getting better from where we were a year ago, but by no means are we back to a pre-pandemic level of normalcy in the supply chain. And so what we're seeing on inventory right now is we're starting to do just what we said, which is we're starting to bring inventory levels down.  If you look at where we landed in Q1 on a year-over-year basis, we've been able to reduce inventory levels by about $30 million. And so you probably saw that, our cash provided by operations is up. Part of that is our ability to reduce inventory levels. And that also helps on the cost side as we have less product to move around, less warehousing fees, and we're not storing that product.  And so we've started to raise inventory levels. I expect that to continue this quarter. And then we're going to really continue to watch the supply chain. And as we have more confidence in our ability to respond to consumer demand and we expect less disruption, we [ seem to be able to ] work that down even further. But we're starting to make good progress there. Operator : And our next question comes from Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Jason English : A couple of questions, also on gross margin. So first, you indicated you expect GMs to be up 100 to 200 bps this quarter. Let's just take the high end of the range, that would imply around 35%, which would be 100 basis points below what you actually did this quarter.  Historically, there's not a lot of seasonality. Maybe you're talking about pushing through more price. So why would gross margins go down sequentially? What's the incremental headwind that you expect to be weighing on results in the second quarter? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, Jason. Thanks for the call. I would say, in terms of driving gross margin accretion, and to your point, 100, 200 basis points of what we're projecting, we continue to project pretty strong performance on cost savings. I expect pricing to build from Q1 to Q2, as I mentioned earlier.  And then in terms of headwinds, we continue to face a very difficult cost environment. We had over 300 basis points of headwinds in Q1. I expect another challenging quarter in Q2 from cost inflation. We're seeing the same thing in logistics and manufacturing.  And as we mentioned, we've got a couple of supply chain disruptions that we're dealing with in the second quarter, and that's also going to be a partial drag on margin as well as we work through those, which we expect to get resolved by the third quarter.  And then probably the last item I'd highlight is volume deleveraging. We do expect volumes to be down in Q2. And as you know, there's some manufacturing deleveraging associated with that. And so when I look across all those drivers, the good news is we expect to be at an inflection point where we start rebuilding margins this quarter, and I expect that to continue. But within the puts and takes, we expect about 100 to 200 basis points this quarter. Jason English : Okay. And the recall expense goes away, too. So you had more price, less recall expense, and gross margins go lower. I'm missing something here in this, Kevin, from the 1Q to... Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, there is -- yes, the only one, I would say -- the only other item I would highlight is there is seasonality in our business. Q2 tends to be our lower quarter because it's the lowest quarter for our Kingsford business, which is a nice profitable business. And so typically, Q2 is a lower quarter for us in a normalized environment, and we'd expect that this quarter as well. Jason English : Okay. And then the manufacturing and logistics, I hear you a lot and clear on logistics, [ we can't refute ] that, right? We all see diesel prices. But I think many of us were expecting, at least the manufacturing component, to flip to a tailwind as you exited some of those co-managed, repatriated volume. And at least my expectation is that would be a powerful mitigator to some logistics.  Maybe you can unpack that for us. Are we just overestimating the tailwinds of unwinding some of that incremental cost? Or is it that logistics have really stepped up that much higher, that they're materially outpacing those benefits? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, Jason, I would say, I think you're overestimating the value of unwinding those co-pack agreements. That was a nice benefit, but it was less than 100 bp benefit to logistics and manufacturing as we step out those agreements. So it nicely helps contribute to rebuilding margins, but by no means was it a significant driver to the margin challenges we've been dealing with over the last 6 quarters or so. Operator : And our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : Kevin, can you talk a bit about the operating deleverage risk given how much volumes are declining? And I certainly understand the justification for taking pricing. But we're seeing some big declines in volume. Can you maybe balance the, kind of trying to capture inflation on the cost side versus how much of a drag it might be on the manufacturing deleverage side? Kevin Jacobsen : Sure, Kaumil. It's interesting, when you think about the manufacturing deleveraging, typically, you expect to have a bigger impact for the volume decline we talked about, being down 15%. What you're seeing though here that mitigates that is, as you know, we stepped out of those contract manufacturing agreements, so we brought that volume back into our plants.  And so our plant production volume is not down to the degree you're seeing our shipment cases down or essentially just turning off those co-packers. And so it minimizes the volume deleveraging we're seeing in our facilities. And I expect that going forward. Kaumil Gajrawala : Okay. Great. And you mentioned in your -- I can't remember if it was a press release or your prepared remarks, on distribution gains, is that -- are those gains over the course of this year? And how does the distribution may be compared to 2019? Linda Rendle : Sure. So we've been able to grow total distribution points for 8 consecutive quarters now. And our team is doing the work on both restoring the base. If you remember, we rationalized assortment at the beginning of the pandemic to be able to produce as much product as we possibly could. So part of that is restoring back to some of the distribution that we thoughtfully removed on our own in order to run efficiently.  But then most importantly, we're gaining distribution on the innovation programs that we have in place and have been able to continue that trend moving in the right direction. So we're really happy about where we are from a distribution perspective and continuing to invest in innovation so that we can continue that trend moving forward. Operator : And our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : So first question was just the level of pricing at a total company level, 12%. I was just sitting here opening up all my models, and I don't think we have any other U.S.-facing companies or companies who report geographically in HPC who put up that kind of pricing.  So I guess, Linda, first off, as you put through another round of pricing in December, why is it that you're so confident that we won't see -- start to see some share [ wobbles ]? And you commented on the elasticity not being traded down. So is it just that consumers are using or consuming less at this point and that's the elasticity you're seeing? Because you're suggesting it's not about share loss, but elasticity exists, albeit in line with your forecast. Linda Rendle : Yes. Lauren, on pricing, I think it's very difficult to compare across companies because everybody has different portfolios and to your good point, have different global portfolios. But what I would say, and I think this is important, if we look category by category for us, our pricing is in line with the categories that we compete in around the world.  So as I mentioned earlier, our price gaps are about what they were pre-pandemic, which would, of course, imply that pricing has been about equal across the competitive set that we have in our specific categories and countries. We would expect, although we'll lead in many of these price increases, that, that would continue, that with our price gaps, would largely be in line. But that is something that we are looking at with eyes wide open on our plan, that we might have to make adjustments if that is not the case coming out of the fourth round of pricing in December. But largely, we believe, that will be the case, that our price gaps will continue. While [ mosey ] in the short term as people adjust, will continue to be what they were pre-pandemic.  And then our elasticities are holding exactly what they thought they would. So they've been slightly favorable to pre-pandemic. We're starting to see them drift towards historical levels, which is what we expected. So we're seeing consumer behavior in line with our expectations.  And what elasticity really is in these categories is consumers adjust their behavior. So they are not trading, in our case, in our categories to private label, but they are maybe making a trash bag last a little bit longer by making sure it's full all the way. They are delaying their purchase cycles a little bit and trying to stretch what product they have. And that's typically what we see in our categories. People don't just exit them in full, but they try to find ways to get a bigger bang for their buck. And that's consistent with the behavior we're seeing.  And we don't expect that to change for the fourth round of pricing. But to your very good point, we are going to watch it very carefully, and we're ready to make adjustments to our plan if we need to, to ensure our price gaps are in line and our business continues to remain healthy with consumers. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. And I guess, recognizing how strong the aggregate sales growth is without a doubt, I guess, and the elasticity in line with expectations, as you said a couple of times, but at what point does the rate of volume decline be something that is more than you want to see? That -- because it's a bit striking, right? We've had lots of companies that we've seen take a lot of pricing, but no one has -- the volume decline of this magnitude is striking.  So at what point does that become problematic? That if you weren't in the position of having the benefit of bringing production back in-house, that's supporting the margin and obfuscating any kind of degree of volume deleverage, that it would be a bigger problem. So as we look forward, I think that's just an important question to think about, your sensitivity to volume declines or lack thereof. Linda Rendle : Yes. We're focused really on 3 big buckets, Lauren. We're focused on ensuring we maintain top line momentum, which is, of course, in part, sustained by selling a certain amount of volume at a certain price. We are laser-focused on rebuilding margins over time. And as Kevin and I have reiterated, we're committed to growing margins over the long term and returning them back to pre-pandemic levels. And then most importantly, the foundation of all of that is having healthy brands. And so you can bet, we are looking incredibly closely at all of the consumer metrics to see and ensure that we remain in a good spot.  And here is what we see to date, but we'll be watching this moving forward. We have the highest consumer value rating on record since we've measured it, with 75% of our portfolio deemed superior by consumers and increasing superiority in countries around the world as we've measured it.  We're making progress on share, growing share in our largest 4 businesses. International looks really strong. So I don't think -- from a category perspective, we're not underperforming, and we're seeing similar types of activities from our peers given our price gaps have remained the same.  Innovation is working in these categories, and people are continuing to look for that for a source of value. So the consumer fundamentals continue to remain strong. We expect volume loss as part of pricing. And we expect, over time, we'll start to build some of that volume back as behavior normalizes.  But really, we're keeping an eye on that trifecta and managing that very carefully. And of course, that third bucket is all what it hinges on. And Lauren, we're looking at it all the time to ensure we continue to offer that value to consumers. And to date, we do, and we'll make adjustments if we don't. And if it does get to the point where those metrics start to erode in a place where we don't feel the long-term ability for us to grow and grow margins is there, then we'll make adjustments. But for now, I feel very comfortable with the 3 rounds of pricing and the fourth we have planned for December based on what we're seeing from the consumer. Operator : And our next question comes from Stephen Powers from Deutsche Bank. Stephen Robert Powers : So kind of staying on the topic of pricing and maybe just to clean up from -- in my own mind some of those earlier discussion, I guess, I'm just curious on the sort of the cost justification, the impetus for the price increase, the fourth round in December, just given that, it sounded like the overall cost inflation outlook for the year was around about the same, especially on commodities. And the first quarter gross margin, if you take out the recall impact, came in a couple of hundred basis points above your original outlook. So is there something I'm missing in there? Or was the price increase contemplated in the original outlook for the year? Just if you could help me there, that would be great. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure, Steve. Let me try to provide a little bit more perspective on pricing and what we're trying to accomplish with our pricing. And as you know, from some of our previous discussions, we're not pricing just looking at the cost environment right now, but this is pricing to recover the cost inflation we've dealt with over several years.  If you look at the last 2 years, plus what we're projecting this year, it's about $1.5 billion of cost inflation to our supply chain. All else being equal, that's over 20 gross margin points we have lost through cost inflation over that period of time. That's what we're working to build back.  Now pricing is a very important element of that. We don't expect to recover it all through pricing. That's why we're also driving our cost savings program. We're working to optimize our supply chain.  And so this fourth round of pricing was always contemplated in our outlook. And it is part of the actions we're taking to rebuild the margins because of the cost inflation, not only this year, but the cost inflation we've been dealing with over the last 36 months.  And we think this is a necessary action, again along with all the other actions we're taking. It put us in a position to start rebuilding margins this year, and I'd expect that to continue as we move into fiscal year '24. Stephen Robert Powers : Okay. Okay. So is there -- I mean, outside of the FX-driven pricing in overseas markets, is there additional pricing contemplated in the current year outlook that we should also be contemplating? Or is -- I'm just trying to get a sense for at what point were incremental to your plan. Linda Rendle : Yes, Steve. So we always have the December price increase planned, but we are taking some additional brands than we had originally planned and contemplated in the outlook. And at this point, we're going to continue to take pricing over the course of this long-range plan until we get to the place where we've rolled up all margins, and that will be a combination of cost savings and pricing and supply chain optimization, and of course, hopefully, seeing some of these commodities roll over in the out-years.  But at this point, we don't have any additional pricing to speak about here, but we'll keep you updated as we take additional rounds. And if you recall, we talked about price pack architecture playing a bigger role moving forward. And those actions, we have been working on for the last 12 to 18 months, and we're going to start to see those have a bigger impact in the back half of this fiscal year and in fiscal year '24. Operator : And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Linda, I wanted to come back to market share and potential trade-down risk. I guess just first, I'm trying to reconcile a bit some of the differences that we're seeing in the scan data versus your comments. The Nielsen data would suggest you're losing share in more than half of your portfolio.  And then I also kind of took note about your comments, about you're not seeing any material signs of trade down from your brands or to private label. And that seems to have been inconsistent with what we're seeing in the Nielsen data as well, where private label is picking up share in bags and bleach and wipes and dressing, et cetera. So my first question is just that, maybe just some overarching views on what you might be seeing the differences in tracked versus nontracked channels. Linda Rendle : Sure. Yes, my comments on market share against growing all-outlet share in the 4 largest businesses obviously contemplates beyond what you can see in Nielsen. But what you see in Nielsen is consistent with what we see in tracked channels.  And what I've said is there's a bunch of factors going on here. You have pricing, you have demand normalization, and then you have things like assortment normalization that are still going on as that -- the impacts from the pandemic are getting flushed out.  What we can say with confidence is there is no material trade down due to pricing that we are seeing in private label in our categories. In fact, what we're really seeing is some of the third-tier brands being squeezed, where we're growing share and private label is growing share in categories. But we don't see a trading between our portfolio given the pricing that we're taking.  But you are seeing things like assortment normalization continue, and those can have an impact in individual categories. But all of the data that we see, looking at both tracked and nontracked channels, we don't have any material trade down to private label. Kevin Grundy : Okay. I guess it would not be terribly surprising if that were to be the case, I guess, particularly in your categories, right, where we're not seeing it as much in personal care, you don't see it much in beverages, and we're not really seeing it in alcohol.  So is it your expectation that we -- that you do not see it in your current planning as you're thinking about category growth rates, elasticities and share that's not currently embedded in your outlook? Linda Rendle : That's correct, Kevin. We do not have a material trade down to private label included in our outlook. And that is consistent with how we performed. If you look at 2008, private label did not make any material share progress in our categories, and we're anticipating much the same in this environment. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle, I would like to now turn the program back to you. Linda Rendle : Thanks again, everyone. I look forward to speaking with you again on our next call in February. Until then, please stay well. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Clorox Company Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. Lisah Burhan : Thank you, Jen. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Linda Rendle, our CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. I hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. In just a moment, Linda will share a few opening comments, and then we'll take your questions. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, including about our fiscal 2023 outlook. These statements are based on management's current expectations, but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements, which has been filed with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the non-GAAP financial information section of our earnings release and the supplemental financial schedule in the Investor Relations section of our website, for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Now I'll turn it over to Linda. Linda Rendle : Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, despite persistent macroeconomic headwinds, we delivered better-than-expected Q2 results, with organic sales growth in 3 of 4 segments, gross margin expansion, and double-digit earnings growth. Our performance reflects the strength and superior value of our brands, strong execution across a broad set of actions and the benefit of some timing shifts. As a result, we've updated our full-year outlook.  During the quarter, we made good progress through building margin, driving top line momentum and executing against our IGNITE Strategy to strengthen our advantages and accelerate profitable growth for the long term. This includes advancing our innovation pipeline, delivering cost savings and taking additional cost-justified pricing actions while maintaining record high consumer value superiority. Overall, we feel good about our progress, but we're relentlessly driving additional improvements as we continue to invest in our brands, categories and capabilities. Looking ahead, we expect the operating environment to remain volatile and challenging, and we'll continue using all the levers under our control while protecting the value proposition of our products to recover margin and drive long-term growth for our brands and categories. We are confident that our leading product portfolio in essential categories, coupled with our proactive actions will enable us to navigate this environment and return to more consistent profitable growth over time. With that, Kevin and I will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Peter Grom with UBS. Peter Grom : Thanks, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. So maybe just to start, when we think about the 2Q performance, and I know you outlined a few things on the script, but just from our perspective, plus 4% organic versus the original guidance of down low single digits and kind of gross margin coming in at 200 basis points or so above in midpoint of your outlook, it's a decent amount of upside versus what you were expecting. So can you maybe just help us understand where were the biggest surprises versus your forecast for those 2 items? Linda Rendle : Sure. Thanks, Peter. So the first thing that I would just start with, and I'll hand it over to Kevin to walk through the quarter in a bit more detail, we're doing exactly what we said we were going to do. We are maintaining top line momentum, which came in better than we expected, and Kevin will walk you through those factors, while also doing the hard work to improve margins. And so from that perspective, we're feeling good about that balance. We're going to continue to be focused on it for the year. And Kevin, why don't you take them through the details of how the quarter should go. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. Peter, I would say in terms of the strength of the quarter, if I think about the top line, as Linda said, really good strong fundamentals on the business. We saw consumption up 6%. We held share, direct  channels in the U.S. We continue to grow shares internationally. We delivered a record cost savings for the quarter. In fact, we had to go back and look, this is the strongest quarter we've had in the last 10 years, so really great execution by our team. Another area I'd highlight is we hit a record case fill rate since the pandemic has begun. And so our team continues to make very good progress, improving our supply chain operations in spite of the ongoing disruptions we're dealing with. And so I'd say from a business fundamentals perspective, the team has done really good work this quarter. And then I'd also say, and you saw in our prepared remarks, we've had some benefit from some timing shifts. One we'd call out is cold and flu season. We saw the season start earlier than we anticipated, and we think it's peaked in our Q2. Typically, you see cold and flu season peak in our -- in the January-February time frame, which is our Q3. So we think that's pulled forward into Q2, some of our shipments for cleaning and disinfecting products. We also had a little bit of merchant timing shifts, and that's pretty typical moving between quarters that it won't have any impact on the year, but provided some benefit to the quarter. And then lastly, as I said, cost savings, while it was certainly a record quarter, and we're on track for the full year to have a very strong year. The team was able to pull forward some of that benefit. And so collectively, the good strong fundamentals of the business plus a little bit of timing benefit were the primary drivers of the really strong performance in the quarter. Peter Grom : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just a bigger picture question on the gross margin front. And you've obviously have made some great strides here in the past -- this quarter specifically. But Kevin, I would just be curious if you could comment on how we should be really thinking about gross margin progression for the next 18 months or so in the context of what we're seeing today, given the 40% exit rate. I just would assume that you could have substantial margin expansion on top of the 37% that you're guiding to for this year. If we can -- if we should expect sequential improvement from the 40% into the first half of next year. So just any thoughts on kind of the margin recovery and how we should be kind of thinking about gross margin expansion over the next 18 months or so? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, Peter, what I'd say is I'm not going to provide an outlook for our fiscal year '24 today. I'm going to resist doing that because there's so much volatility right now. We want to get a little further into this year, finish the plans. We're just starting to develop our plans for next year right now, so it's a little premature to talk about that. But what I would say is we feel very good about the progress we're making. As you folks know, we believe this quarter was an inflection point for us, where we returned to gross margin expansion. We've done that, that you saw in our prepared remarks. We expect to build on that in Q3, looking to get to 200 to 300 basis points of additional expansion and then continue in Q4. And then as you think forward beyond fiscal year '23, at a very high level, you should expect us to continue to prioritize what we're doing right now, which is maintaining our top line momentum and making the investments necessary to do that. We're continuing to work to rebuild margins, and we said that'll take some time, but that work is underway. And then we're going to continue to drive our strategic initiatives, our digital transformations, our streamlined operating model. Those will continue to be our priorities. But we'll give you a better feel for that as we get closer to fiscal year '24. . Operator : Our next question will come from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Just a point clarification on gross margins. You came in better than expected in both Q1 and Q2. Is there some offset in the back half of the year as we think about full year guidance not changing? Or is it more conservatism just given the volatility out there? And then secondly, you took some pricing in December. Any initial thoughts on competitive response, if you're seeing any big pushbacks from retailers? Probably too early to judge consumer demand, but any thoughts on that front would be helpful also just relative to the December increases. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. And let me start on gross margin and then Linda can comment on pricing. As it relates to gross margin, as you said, we did overdeliver our expectations for Q2. We came into the quarter targeting a 100 to 200 basis point improvement. We delivered a little over 300. If you look at the drivers of that over-delivery, I'd point to 2 items. The first is less operating deleveraging. So because of the very strong top line performance and it exceeded our expectations, volume was only down 10% for the quarter. We had anticipated it to be down more, and we're expecting more deleveraging. So we see the benefit of that item, which tends to be discrete in the quarter. And then we did have some benefit of pulling cost savings forward. Now we remain on track to have a very good year. We're not changing our full year view of cost savings, but the team did some nice work pulling some of those projects in early and I'm always happy to get cost savings projects started early, but that was a benefit as well that will have a bit of an impact on the back half of the year. And so I think this is a balanced forecast for gross margins where we continue to believe we'll get to about 38% in the full year. And Dara, you made this comment, and I agree, it's still an environment with lower visibility and quite a bit of volatility. And so I want to see how this fourth round of pricing plays out. It's a little early for us to read. I want to get another quarter under our belt and see how that's playing out, and I think we'll have a better perspective on the full year. But with that, let me turn it over to Linda to talk a little bit more about pricing. Linda Rendle : Yes. As Kevin just mentioned, we executed that fourth round of pricing in early December. And as Kevin noted, it's too early to determine, from a consumer perspective, the reaction. I would say, to date, everything looks in line with our expectations from an elasticity perspective. But again, too early, we haven't had a full purchase cycle yet, and it's still being reflected in the market. As it relates to competition, we did say in this price increase, we led for the most part on this round of pricing. And while we've seen some category movement in pricing. There are other categories we have not seen competitors move in yet. And we're watching that really, really closely to see what that's going to look like and prepare -- we're prepared to react. If our price gaps get out of line, or if we're seeing a consumer reaction not in line with our expectations given the full category hasn't moved. So too early yet to judge that, but it is true that some categories, we have not seen competition move subsequent to our pricing. Operator : And our next question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : So I wanted to go back to the top line outlook improvement. So I think that probably, as you mentioned, it's a function of price elasticity or maybe the pull forward of shipments at this point. And is that the reason why you also did not raise guidance as much as you could have given the beat? Is that something that perhaps the retailers took more shipments ahead of the price increase in December and therefore, you can see some of that pull forward corrected in the third quarter fiscal? Is that how we should be thinking? Kevin Jacobsen : Andrea, I would say, overall, I feel very good about where we're at from a top line perspective. And as you saw, we narrowed our range and we moved it to the top half of our range from an organic perspective. We're now targeting flat to up 3%. If you look at our performance through the first half of the year, organic sales growth is a little over 0.5%. So that success suggests much stronger performance in the back half of the year. And so the outlook, I think, really reflects a good start to the year, but it would project acceleration in the back half of the year in terms of organic sales growth really driven by, again, good strength in the business plus the ongoing impact of the pricing actions we're taking. I think if you look at the range right now, you can do the math. It would suggest the back half would be anywhere from flat to up 5% on an organic basis. And we've got still a fairly wide range in the back half of the year. And I think that reflects exactly what Linda was just talking about. There is some uncertainty about how this fourth round of pricing will go. And so we think it's appropriate to maintain a bit wider range until we see exactly how both the consumers react to this round of pricing as well as what we see from other manufacturers in terms of if they choose to follow or not. Andrea Teixeira : And with the fourth quarter price increase, just a fine point, I'm sorry, the December price increase, the fourth round, can you remind us again how much would be the average pricing that you're getting to the beginning of the third quarter as we enter the third quarter? Linda Rendle : Yes. This fourth round was a bit more moderate than we had taken in July, if you recall, July was the largest of the 4 price increases. This one was around mid-single digits and fairly broad across the portfolio, but more moderate than we had taken in the past. And again, too early to judge on what the pricing looks like and what the impacts are. But this one was definitely more moderate than what we saw in July. And if you look at July, the elasticities are exactly in line with our expectations across categories. So we would expect our models to continue to hold in December, but it's dynamic out there and consumers are certainly facing a lot of inflation in their broader basket, so we're watching it closely. Andrea Teixeira : That's helpful. The -- so the mid-single digits plus a high single, like in general, like ,on average, you're probably running around mid-teens. And then so that implies, in the midpoint of the range, if the 0 to 5, you're looking at 2.5%, you're probably looking at elasticities running around 12%, 13%. Is that the way your model now calls for the second half? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. Andrea, what I'd say, in terms of elasticities, our expectation is elasticities for this December round of pricing would be very similar to what we saw in July, which is consistent with our historical levels of elasticities. You might remember in the first few rounds, we were seeing lower elasticities than historical levels. Consumers were less price sensitive. But now that's really reverted back to historical level elasticity. And then I would say on the back half, be a little careful because we do have some shifting as we talk about between quarters. I think maybe a better way to look at that, if you try to take out the noise of some volume shifting between Q2 and Q3, Q2, we had 4% organic sales growth. You saw in my prepared remarks, you may have seen, we're projecting 2% to 3% growth organic sales growth in Q3. Over that 6-month period, we're looking at organic sales growth a little over 3%. And so clearly, an acceleration of where we've been based on the fundamentals of the business we're talking about. But consumers continue to be resilient. Our categories have been -- shown to be resilient to date, and I think that's reflected in raising our outlook. Andrea Teixeira : And the elasticity is about 0.7, right, if my math serves me right on average on all the categories? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, say, Andrea, we don't comment on -- specifically on elasticity. And as you can imagine, they're quite different by category, by geography. And so it's something we don't comment publicly on the elasticities of the brands. Operator : And our next question will come from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : Can you talk a bit about supply and about inventory? You mentioned that fill rates were great. Maybe just a little bit more on your ability to supply through your variance, maybe digging into the categories a little bit? And then how do you feel about trade inventories as well as maybe inventories in the pantries? Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. Thanks, Kaumil, for the question. On supply, I would say the supply chain, we're definitely seeing improvements from the disruptions we're dealing with over the last year or 2. It continues to normalize, and that certainly helped benefit our inventory levels. So as you know, we have raised safety stocks to try to help manage the supply chain disruptions we're dealing with and create less impact to our ability to ship product to our retailers. As the supply chain is normalizing, we are able to go back and reduce the safety stock levels. And so as an example, in Q2, this is our fourth straight quarter that we've been able to reduce the inventory levels. I think year-over-year, we pulled another 4 days out of inventory on hand, and that's really a reflection of an improving supply chain. And you heard my earlier comment, 1 example of that is we've hit the highest case fill rate we've been able to deliver since the pandemic began. Now we've done that through some very good work by our team. But I would tell you, we are still dealing with intermittent supply chain disruptions. And I'm sure you'll remember last quarter, we talked about a few disruptions on our Glad and our Burt's Bees business, so that continues to occur. But it's certainly starting to normalize, and we're seeing less disruptions than we did a few years ago. And so that's allowed us to continue to work to optimize our supply chain. And one of those elements is reducing inventory levels. And then from a retailer perspective, the only place we saw some change in retailer inventory levels was on our Brita business in Q2. So we did see a little bit of a reduction in retail inventories on that business. Nothing else to speak of. And I would tell you in our outlook, we're not anticipating any additional material changes to retail inventories. That always goes on every quarter. You'll see some noise, but nothing that we think has any meaningful impact on our outlook, and that's what's assumed right now. And then maybe I know, Linda, do you want to talk about consumer pantry levels? Linda Rendle : Yes. What we're seeing is very similar to what Kevin highlighted just in retail. We are not seeing significant pantry loading by consumers or changes in behavior as it relates to the pantry. What we are seeing, and I think we'll highlight it in probably some discussion around what's going on with pricing with the consumer, we are seeing consumers continue to drive value-seeking behaviors given what they're facing. So we're seeing some purchase cycles extend as people try to make products work longer for them. They're purchasing different sizes. So that's changing the purchase cycle. But that's largely in line with what we would expect from the elasticity impact that's in line with our expectations. And we're not seeing any other consumer behavior that's abnormal outside of that normal elasticity impact. Kaumil Gajrawala : Okay. Got it. So I guess if supply chains in more of a normal place, inventories are at a normal place, both at retail and consumer, you now have a higher top line outlook that's -- we're in more of a normalized zone then. Is that fair to say? Some of those puts and takes over the last couple of years are behind us? Kevin Jacobsen : I wouldn't say normalized me. I think that's probably overstating it. We are still dealing with supply chain disruptions. I would just say the frequency of those disruptions has definitely gone down. But I would not say we're -- I wouldn't describe it as a normal environment. We're still dealing with a number of challenges on a regular basis. But certainly, it's a lower frequency. And we were just talking last quarter about several of those that we're still working to resolve are mostly behind us. And I would expect we'll see more disruptions going forward. I don't believe we're in a position not to expect that. And so that's probably the way I would better describe it than we're in a normal environment. . Kaumil Gajrawala : Got it, better than before, but not normal. Kevin Jacobsen : Certainly better than before. Operator : And we'll hear next from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Christopher Carey : I wanted to follow up on the supply chain dynamic in the context of your gross margin outlook for Q3. I -- and I guess it's similar to the volume outlook. But I'm struggling a little bit given the delivery in Q2 with why it should be potentially a lot better, right? Unless productivity gets worse, you have pricing, which is going to remain strong. Raw materials probably get sequentially better. You just were talking about manufacturing and logistics, which sounds like it should get better. And then from a volume standpoint, you're going to be tracking similar to what you just did in Q2. And so why is the -- maybe like the other -- why is the operating deleverage so much worse in Q3? Or maybe, like, what am I missing? What gets worse sequentially? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, Chris, thank you for the question. And I agree. We do expect gross margin will get better in Q3. If you look at what we provided in the prepared remarks, we're looking at a gross margin of 38% to 39%, so I think a very nice improvement for where we landed in Q2 at just a little over 36%. You may also recall, we don't use spot rates when we develop our outlooks. We use forward curves.  So our outlook has always anticipated declining commodity costs as we move through the year. That's not a change in assumption for us. The only other item I would highlight is we will likely see more volume deleveraging in Q3 versus Q2. Because keep in mind now, we have the fourth round of pricing that went into effect in December. It had no meaningful impact on the second quarter. You'll start to see the impact of that in the third quarter, which means I would expect a bit more volume decline in Q3 than versus what we saw in Q2 as you now have one more round in pricing and the elasticities associated with that  round of pricing, so a little bit more volume deleveraging. But in spite of that, we're going to continue to drive nice benefits from pricing, cost savings. And as a result, I expect to continue to make very nice sequential progress. It'll will be up -- we believe, up 200 to 300 basis points versus Q2 and that keeps us very much on track for getting back to about 40% by the fourth quarter. Christopher Carey : Okay. Got it. And then just to confirm that, that volume that you're talking about, that's -- a lot of that's in the Health and Wellness segment just given timing of cold and flu? Kevin Jacobsen : No, the volume deleveraging will be based on the pricing. And as Linda mentioned, the pricing is pretty broad-based across our portfolio. So as we take our fourth round of pricing, there will be an element of volume deleveraging because of the elasticities on those price increases. That will impact the third quarter. But I think the other point you're making also keep in mind, we're lapping the Omicron variant from Q3 of last year. So that'll have an impact on our cleaning and disinfecting business as we've got a more difficult comp on that business. So I think really a combination on both those items, you'll see that play out in our volume projections for Q3. Christopher Carey : Okay. All right. Great. Just 1 quick follow-up still on the gross margin front. This was a nice sequential improvement in the manufacturing and logistics clients, certainly relative to where we were, right? And so have we reached the end of this headwind? Can we start thinking about manufacturing and logistics normalization and maybe even it turns to a tailwind for your gross margins at some point in the back half of next year? And certainly, as we get into fiscal '24, it does seem like some easing in this line item could be an unlock, something which you don't necessarily have control over, but we're looking at freight rates rolling over and again, just the normalization of this line item, it seems like a good development, so I wonder how sticky you think this is and candidly, whether this line item will ever actually become a tailwind for you or just costs are higher and it's likely to remain inflationary over the medium term horizon. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, sure, Chris. I would say, as it relates to manufacturing and logistics, our expectation is it will continue to be a headwind this entire year. So we think it's -- as you saw in our remarks, $400 million of supply chain inflation. About half of that is in commodities. The other half is in manufacturing and logistics. Now we do think it moderates as we move through the year. And so we think each quarter, it'll be less of a hit than the previous quarter, but it'll be inflationary for the entire year, and that's factored into our outlook. And as it relates to the medium to longer term, as I mentioned, we're going to hold off on making any comments on fiscal year '24. It's just a little too early for us to do that. But at least this year, you should assume it'll continue to be inflationary, but moderating as we move through the quarters. . Operator : And our next question will come from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Two quick questions. I guess, logistics and manufacturing are now off the table. But in cleaning, you guys mentioned that professional is still lagging. And I think you cited in there, 1 driver is office occupancy, which seems odd. It seems like we're deep enough into COVID, where office occupancy is actually going the other way. So can you unpack a bit more of the headwinds on the Professional business in cleaning? Linda Rendle : Sure. Jason, there was really 2 factors in Professional. One, which is a more midterm issue and then one that was a very short-term issue. That affected professional last quarter. And I'll start with that one, which was our Pine-Sol recall and that impacted Professional. We have a fairly large business in Pine-Sol in Professional, and we'd expect as we bring that distribution back, that just to be a short-term impact. As you look at the medium term, though, office occupancy is still down significantly as return to office has been delayed, and we've all seen the press on how hard it's been to get people to come back into the office to the degree that we thought we would. So that continues to be a headwind to the business. We're looking at other avenues to grow the business beyond just that, looking at our portfolio broadly and innovation. And we continue to have conviction that our professional business will be a growth driver for us in the future. And it's good to see it start to be a bit more normalized than it was in the past, but we are still dealing with that office occupancy headwind. Jason English : Okay. Okay. And Kevin, I've had a lot of debate with investors recently around sort of normalized earnings. I think probably everyone's having that debate. But 1 key point of it really does rests at gross profit. And I know you aspire to get back to historical gross margins in time. But one way we're looking at it is around unit economics with the notion that gross profit per unit is probably a more reasonable near-term target of what a normalized gross profit would look like. What, if any, holes do you see in that thought process? And if you think gross profit per unit should be a lot higher than it was in fiscal '19, can you give us an understanding or a better explanation of kind of why and maybe where you might be able to achieve that? Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. Jason, I would say we aspire to do both. I mean, you start by rebuilding gross profit then ultimately rebuild gross margin over time. For us, it'll be the same drivers we've talked about. We're going to continue to execute the pricing actions that we've taken. And as we've said, we don't have any additional plans to take further pricing this fiscal year based on our cost forecast. But we'll continue to drive pricing. We'll continue to drive cost savings and supply chain optimization. That's the way that we think puts us in a position to first recover gross profit and then ultimately keep going to recover gross margin. Typically, I'd say, in a normal environment, the work we do on cost savings is enough to offset a normalized level of inflation and allow us to build margins over time. And that allows us to continue to invest in our brands and continue to set the company. We have to deliver value over the long term. Obviously, we're dealing with a very unique environment right now with the unprecedented level of cost inflation. And so that's why we're leaning into pricing. I'd like to believe over time , as we get to a normalized environment as you described, we get back to more of our consistent model where we're really driving cost savings, and that's allowing us to offset inflation and build margin over time. But we're not in that environment right now. So we're leaning more aggressively into pricing. But I think ultimately, it's always both. We start by rebuilding gross profit and then we ultimately work to rebuild gross margin over time. Operator : Our next question will come from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Great. Question for both of you really on investment spending. I guess, sort of -- well, I'm trying to connect the dots here. So you're still targeting 10% of sales for the year. You're about 9% in the first half. Kevin, I think you mentioned, so that implies naturally, an acceleration in the back half of the year. Can you guys comment for a moment, I guess, on destinations for the spend? Number two, why we would not expect to see a little bit more of an acceleration? If that's the case, why not more of sort of an immediate top line payback and understanding that some of this is sort of more longer term in nature? It'd be great to get your thoughts on that. And then the third piece, because I think kind of coming away from the call, there's going to be, I suspect, a view that the gross margin guidance may be a little bit conservative given the strong performance in the front half of the fiscal year. What's your feeling on potential reinvestment? Understanding it's a long still -- there's still ways to get back to where you'd like to from a gross margin perspective. But how are you feeling about potential reinvestment this year? Should you exceed on your gross margin guidance, what's the likelihood that you would sort of lean in here and reinvest given some of the promising signs you've seen on the top line? Linda Rendle : Kevin, on the investment spending piece, incredibly important. We're seeing good consumer and category resilience. We're happy that we are maintaining share in an environment. We are aggressively going after rebuilding margin. And you all know that's exactly what we've targeted. We want to keep our top line momentum while rebuilding margins at the same time. And that's how we're approaching investments. We're making the right short-term investments to do that, but we're also not taking our eye off the long term and continuing to invest in those things that are going to make us a stronger company, like our digital transformation and like our op model. So that's what we're focused on. It just happens to be the shape of spending to have less in the front half of the year versus the back half given our plans, but that's just the shape of the investment, and we still are targeting 10% from an advertising and sales promotion perspective, still continuing to invest in innovation. That's been going well for us. And overall, going to continue to focus that investment on our brands.  What I will say, though, is we're watching our categories incredibly closely right now. And the most important thing that we do is continue to deliver superior value to our consumers. And right now, we're really happy to say, among all that pricing that we took, strong double digits, we've maintained our record high superiority rating of 76%. We were in the 50% range a few years ago. And that combination gives us the confidence to continue to invest. But if we see a change in that, where consumers are reacting in a different way or if we don't see competition follow on price increases, we are ready with backup plans that we can activate very, very quickly to make adjustments to that. And if we need to make additional investments, we will to support the value spirit of our brands. But we feel we have that balance right, right now. That played out in Q2 behind the good balance we had in top line and bottom line. But that's how we're thinking about it overall, and we'll continue to take a proactive approach of adjusting if we need to. Kevin Grundy : I appreciate the color. If I could just 1 very quick follow-up, and I think you kind of touched on this a little bit. Are you starting to hear from retailers at all just given some of the moderation in commodities that they'd like to see more on deal here, more trade promotion? Because it hasn't moved up -- looking at the scatter data on the 4 12-week basis, we haven't seen it move up a lot. And we know that some of the categories you play in, historically have been heavily promoted categories. I want to assess it as a risk, but is that sort of coming up that some of this pricing you're going to take, you're going to have to go back on deal? And then I'll pass it on. Linda Rendle : Kevin, what you're seeing in the latest data is what we see from a Q2 perspective in that promotion is still below where it was pre-pandemic across our categories. It's higher than it was a year ago in our categories, but definitely lower than pre-pandemic. And what we're hearing from retailers, which you would expect, is how do we continue to keep our categories healthy. So it's not a discussion on promotion necessarily. It's a discussion on how we have the right set for -- with the right distribution for our products, how we can lean into innovation and drive value from a market basket perspective, from a retailer perspective. But we are not hearing in a normal amount of level of interest in promotion because they know that's not usually the right way to drive the category.  We want to use promotion very strategically in times of the year where we can ensure that consumers like back-to-school, for example, or cold and flu, where we know people are looking for our products, and we can introduce them to innovation or remind them to buy. So those conversations continue to be really constructive and we're mutually focused on ensuring the categories are healthy and doing it the right way. Operator : Our next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital. Lauren Lieberman : Great. First thing I wanted to ask about was the performance in household, because the volume growth was pretty striking. So just curious if you could tell us a little bit more about which of the businesses had volumes up and if there was any of the merchandising attached to that or kind of what was going on there. Because, again, to see volume up with pricing as strong as it is, is pretty notable. Kevin Jacobsen : Lauren, yes, I'm happy to answer the question on households. As you saw, we had 9% growth in the segment. From a volume perspective, really litter was the star of the group. We had double-digit growth on that business. And we continue to see very strong category growth. As you know, we've talked about it before. strong pet adoption during the pandemic. That's continued to fuel that category. And then we've continued to see very strong performance in that business. And so we are seeing -- in spite of the pricing we've taken, we are still growing volume in that business, more than offsetting the elasticity impact. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Great. And then also, just on the pricing. I'm [ not ] sure which of you had mentioned that pricing really had very little impact on the second quarter given the timing that went into the market and some of it is still showing up on shelves. So as we think about modeling forward, you spoke to seeing more volume pressure, but should we also see pricing accelerating versus what's already in the financials in the second quarter? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, Lauren, I think you'll have 2 impacts. Now we're starting to lap the first round of pricing we took last year. So you're starting to see some of that first run of pricing drop off as we get into the back half of our fiscal year, and it's being replaced with his fourth round. So it's not as clean as another round of pricing being added. I think in aggregate, this fourth round was larger than our first round. So in aggregate, you'll see a little bit more benefit from pricing, and you see a little larger hit in terms of the impact to volume from elasticities. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. All right. That's great. And yes -- and then just a final question, which we've -- I thought it was interesting the way the prepared remarks were written about rebuilding household penetration. So knowing that you don't typically expect a lot of revenue growth when you take pricing and everything is kind of going according to plan, but I was curious what categories kind of warrant that extra attention with -- specifically with regard to rebuilding household penetration. And what, if anything, you can tell us about plans to do that? Linda Rendle : Yes, Lauren, this is a fundamental thing we're really focused on. And one of the trade-offs you do when you take the level of pricing that we're taking in the categories is you trade off some household penetration in the short term in order to do that. And while we're still in 9 out of 10 households and have very strong household penetrations across our category and in most cases, are performing better than the category is in household penetration, this is 1 of the trade-offs that we're making. And I think it's the right trade-off given the fact that we need to both maintain top line momentum and rebuild margins. But that being said, household penetration is incredibly important to us and the health of our business over the long term, and we are committed to regrowing that over time. And typically, what we see in price increases, you see some volume loss initially as consumers adjust their behavior. You begin to rebuild that over time.   So our first focus on household penetration will be rebuilding volumes over the mid- to long term. And we will do that by continuing to invest in innovation, having strong levels of investment in our brands as we're going to have 10% spending in A&SP this year and continuing to make the wrong -- right long-term digital investments to support brand building, et cetera. One note we were really proud of, we had our highest ROI marketing in this last period due to the personalization efforts that we've taken out. So we haven't talked a lot about that, but that's working, and it's allowing our money to work harder and will allow us to help us focus on growing household penetration over time. So what I would -- just again, to say it, this is a wide-eyed open trade-off that we are making in household penetration, but it's something that as we rebuild volumes, we would expect to rebound over time. And what's key to that is continuing to invest in our brands. Operator : And our next question will come from Olivia Tong with Raymond James Financial. Olivia Tong Cheang : Great. I wanted to ask you about Glad and Burt's, where things stand there. Particularly with Glad, given the particularly strong performance in household, how much that contributed, if Glad continues to be an issue. And then with Burt's, where do we stand with respect to some of the supply chain challenges there? Linda Rendle : Sure. Glad was a business we were up in sales this quarter. We actually grew share from a trash perspective. So we're really pleased with the performance of Glad through multiple rounds of pricing. We're seeing strong performance in the market, and that's really behind our innovation program that we've spent a lot of time talking about, whether it be the addition of colors and sense, our focus on value there. Our work on distribution across the retailer base is paying off, and we feel good about where that business is from a trash perspective.  And then from a Burt's perspective, we did share that we had a supply disruption that happened and we believe we'll be able to work through it through Q3, and that continues to be the case. We made good progress on it in Q2 when we're able to support some strong holiday promotions and sales that led to growth on that business, but we still have some work to do, and we intend to be through that by the end of this quarter. Olivia Tong Cheang : Right. And then just following up. I know you mentioned a couple of times, it's too early to read too much into the December pricing. But just overall, are you seeing any bifurcation as far as pack sizes or willingness to stay with branded versus private label with high-end consumers versus low-end? And I imagine that as the year progressed -- so I don't think you have so far, but as the year progresses, how much of that is embedded into sort of some conservatism on the outlook? Because it seems like the consumer is still sticking with you, but just curious if you see anything that would give you a reason for some caution as the year progresses. Linda Rendle : Sure. As we've said, it really is too early to judge December's price increase at this point. But maybe I'll speak, Olivia, to the broader sets of price increases and just what we're seeing on average and what we continue to expect to happen as December gets fully reflected in the marketplace. We are seeing consumers and our categories remain resilient. And you can see that just in the strong consumption that you see in MULO right now. Consumers are reacting favorably. And I think this is really due to the fact that we're in essential categories. These brands play a role in consumers' every day routines, and we're continuing to see them favor value. That's what we've always focused on with our brands. They're looking for superior value, not necessarily the lowest price. And with our superiority rating, I mentioned earlier, of 76%, consumers continue to feel that our brands are the best value and they're voting for them in store. And with that, we are seeing value-seeking behavior that's within our own brands. So people want to stay with the Clorox company branded product. And so they're trading within our portfolio, and we've seen that over the last number of price increases. Some consumers are choosing to buy opening price points, because perhaps that day, their wallet, they have a limited amount of money they can spend in the category or they're looking for the very, very best value on a price per use basis and so they're trading up to larger sizes, or maybe they're trading within our cleaning portfolio between a dilutable and a spray cleaner in order to get the value equation right for them. And the good news is we have offerings to meet their needs there. And that's what we're really focused on with retailers, ensuring we have the right distribution to meet those needs as consumers continue to look for the best value within our portfolio. And I think we're going to continue to see that happen. As it relates to private label, we're not seeing any meaningful trade down in our categories to private label. And again, we maintain share amid 4 price increases, so that is playing out. But I'll tell you, we're watching it really closely. This -- it looks like it's going to continue to get tougher for the consumer in aggregate. And so we're looking particularly as that fourth round is implemented and particularly in categories where we have higher private label penetration to ensure that we have that right value. And I also mentioned earlier, we haven't seen some competitors reflecting additional price increase as we did in December. And so we're watching our gaps really closely in those categories as well to ensure that we are continuing to offer superior value. And we will make adjustments. We are ready to if we need to, to protect the value of those brands. But at the moment, category and consumer is resilient. Our brands are very resilient maintaining share, and we're going to continue to activate our plans on innovation and investment to keep them healthy. Operator : And our next question will come from Javier Escalante with Evercore ISI. Javier Escalante Manzo : Hello, can you hear me? Sorry for that. I wanted to double-click on the timing factors and the household volume growth of 3%. If you look at the scatter data, it shows a double-digit decline. So if you can help us understand how much stronger these pet food, pet litter business was in the quarter and whether there was a channel shift there. And then I have a question more philosophically to Linda when it comes to the Health and Wellness business. Kevin Jacobsen : Javier, let me see if I answer your question on shifting. So as we mentioned, in Q2, we had some benefit of shifting of some merch activity. And as I said, that's pretty typical that you'll see some merch events shift between quarters out of Q3 into Q2, and that was across a number of businesses. And then more specifically, we're seeing the benefit of an early start to cold and flu season in Q2 as it relates to our Health and Wellness portfolio. But maybe say a little bit more on what your question is. I'm not sure that gets to the question you're asking. Javier Escalante Manzo : No. It's a little bit more of a follow-up on Lauren's question when it comes to did the job being household and the categories that you've referred to, to being the -- shifting was Health and Wellness and they were down 19% and the real jump was in household, and we don't see that in retail. So if you can help us -- if you can give color there and help us understand the disconnect between what we see in retail and what you just reported. Linda Rendle : Yes, I'll jump in on that one, Javier. So you are noting a few categories that have very strong untracked channel performance. And particularly in litter, our business in club, that was up due to some strong merchandising activity we had and actually some of the shift that we experienced from Q3 into Q2. So that's what you're seeing in the difference between the tracked channels and what we're talking about from a volume and sales performance in household. Javier Escalante Manzo : Very helpful, Linda. And then basically curious, how you go about answering this question with consumer research. You have Health and Wellness down 19%. It's lapping down 18% from a year ago volumes. How you see normalization play out? Do you see people cleaning more as they were during the pandemic? Cleaning less? And if they are cleaning less, how much many other quarters you feel that volumes are going to be down in Health and Wellness? Linda Rendle : Yes. This is a category that certainly has had the biggest swings as consumers change their behavior as we went through the height of the pandemic, and we're still lapping. We're still normalizing, given Omicron happened last Q3, and we're in the process of lapping that right now. What I would say is if you look at this last Q2 versus pre-pandemic, our volumes are still higher. So in aggregate, people are still cleaning more.  And certainly, we're still normalizing consumer behavior. And then we had a very abnormal cold and flu season this year. It happened earlier, it happened in December from a peak perspective. It usually happens in January and February. So there are a lot of dynamics in play here around normalization. But what we see is still a business that has great opportunity to grow and be an outsized contributor to the company given people, they care about cleaning and disinfecting as part of keeping them well. But we're going to be normalizing as we get through this and consumers continue to adjust their behavior. And hopefully, we'll get into a more normalized cycle where cold and flu normalizes, and we're seeing a more normalized impact from COVID, but we're not quite there yet. And as we look at the volume loss, that's really due to that factor around normalization, but also the pricing that we have, and it's in line with our expectations. So as we look at that, that just gives us conviction because it's about what we expected it to be. And then as we move forward, we'll continue to adjust as consumers adjust. But it's the same thing we're focusing on innovation in those categories where we can make the job easier for them. We're continuing to invest to help people to understand different ways to keep themselves well, whether that be in a professional setting or at home. But we feel really good about the Health and Wellness business overall. It's just going to be bumpy until we get back to a normalized environment. Operator : And our next question will come from Anna Lizzul with BofA Global Research. Anna Lizzul : I just wanted to follow up on the cost side. You're still seeing cost inflation, but you noted in your prepared remarks that cost inflation has moderated slightly on a sequential basis even though it's still higher year-over-year. I was wondering if you can give some more color on which inputs are moderating and how quickly those are coming down versus the ones that are still headwinds. And then could you also remind us how quickly you expect some of your raw materials come down in your P&L relative to when you see spot prices for those raw materials decline. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. As it relates to the cost environment, and you said it correctly, we are seeing moderating cost increase. Now as I said, we anticipate it's going to be inflationary all year long, but that year-over-year increase will moderate as we move through the year. As I look at specific commodities, we have anticipated resin would be a cost tailwind, so a lower year-over-year cost for resin. That's something we assumed at the beginning of the year, and that continues to play out that we are seeing resin prices favorable year-over-year. But that is being offset by -- we're seeing increases in most of our other buys outside of resin. So soybean oil, linerboard, chemicals, solvents, substrate. Most of the other key buys that we are purchasing, we are seeing cost increases on a year-over-year basis, and we expect that to continue throughout the year. So that's generally how it's playing out. What I would tell you, when you talk about what that moderation is, I think you can see it when you look at just the first half results. If I look at Q1, commodities were a 330 basis point hit to gross margin. In Q2, they're a 240 basis point hit. So that's exactly what we're describing. Still a headwind, but a lower hit each quarter. I would expect that to continue to play out that we'll see a declining impact from commodity costs as we move through the year. But again, we're looking at $400 million for the total inflation, resin being favorable, most of our other buys continue to be unfavorable on a year-over-year basis. Anna Lizzul : And just, could you remind us how quickly you would expect the cost to come down in your P&L just relative to when we see those spot prices coming down? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, I'm sorry that you would ask that question. Well, it really varies by commodities. In some cases, we hedge. And so in those cases, you may have 9 to 18 months before we see the impact of a changing commodity environment play through our cost structure. In other cases, we have contractual relationships with our suppliers that delays those changes. So it's really hard to give you an enterprise answer how quickly that plays through. It is a commodity-by-commodity discussion based on how we set up those relationships with our suppliers. Operator : And our next question will come from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Stephen Robert Powers : On the household penetration topic, I guess the question is how much recovery at this point is anticipated for -- within the remainder of your outlook for fiscal '23? Is that something you expect to see some sequential progress rebuilding in the next few months and quarters? Or is that more of a fiscal '24 and beyond objective? Linda Rendle : Yes, Steve, on household penetration, that is definitely a more mid- to long-term goal for us to get back to household penetration, given the fact that the December price increase is just starting to take a hold now. We would expect to have to go through an entire cycle of that and we haven't even lapped the July price increase, which was our big 1 coming up here. So that will be something that we're focused on now to ensure that we are investing and that we're keeping as many consumers in as we possibly can. But that work will be rebuilding over 24 and beyond. Stephen Robert Powers : Yes. Okay. I mean, is there an assumption that you -- you may go backwards sort of as we get into calendar '23 before you go forward again? Or is it more hold-the-line? Linda Rendle : Yes. I think that's very possible, Steve, based on the fact that we just took that pricing, we could see a bit more of a reduction in household penetration. And again, we think that is the right trade-off to make to get that balance right between top line and bottom line. But yes, it's possible as we go through, we could see some additional household penetration erosion. Stephen Robert Powers : Okay. Okay. And then you talked about promotional intensity in the category. And right now, it seems pretty rational, benign, constructive. I guess, is there, at all, in the base plan, an element of increased promotion as you go through the next couple of quarters? Or is that also more steady state as a base case? Linda Rendle : The base case is more steady state, Steve. As we talk about promotions being a more strategic part of our portfolio than something that we just do to drive volume on a quarterly basis. That's the approach that we're taking for the back half of the year. We have good innovation plans. We want to make sure that we hit consumers on key pulse periods to remind them about the category and the value that we drive. So that's our approach. Again, being what it is, we will look to ensure that we have the right value and that we are competitive. And so if there were to be a change in what we're seeing in the category today, which is slightly higher, like I said earlier, promotion than last year, but still less than in pandemic, we could potentially adjust our plans and we're ready to do that. but we would expect just a more normalized promo environment. That's how we're treating it for the back half, and that's what we've seen so far in Q2. Stephen Robert Powers : Okay. Okay. And the last question, on the one hand, there's definitely a really good news story here in terms of the pricing momentum you've gotten and sort of the gap between price and it's building relative to the cost trend and the gross margin rebuild. On the other hand, you've mentioned a couple of times tonight, just the price gaps that you're watching, whether private label or branded price gaps and just the sort of consumer resiliency post this fourth wave of pricing. I guess can you give us a better sense of what the mile markers are for you in terms of -- is it just the gaps that you're seeing, but you have widened out? Is there a time period where you just don't want to see those gaps that wide for that long? Is it value share? Is it volume share? Is it those household penetration metrics? I mean, I'm sure it's a mosaic of all those things and probably some others, but just give us a little sense of kind of if there are more important indicators in there, that would be helpful, just the way you're thinking about it. Linda Rendle : Yes, you got it right on mosaic, Steve. That's exactly it, which is we're taking a combination of all of those factors as we're deciding if we need to adjust our plans or not. And really primarily, what we're looking at is consumer reaction to our brands, and we're looking very closely at any changes that would be outside of what we expect given the elasticities that we have in market. And then we would make corresponding plans.  And we're looking at competitors to see are they doing something different, are they promoting more heavily, or are they looking at a certain pack size that would make us adjust our plans. Those are the 2 primary factors we're looking at in the very, very short term. And then, of course, as we look over months and quarters, we're looking at share, and we're really happy that we maintain share this quarter given the fourth round of pricing.  But that's the other thing we're watching. Is there too much of a slide in share, is that trade-off not worth it,  et cetera. So we're looking at all of it. But to start, we're looking at that gap, we're looking at consumer behavior by category to say is it different than our expectations and then adjusting from there. Operator : And this concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle, I'd like to now turn the conference back to you. Linda Rendle : Thank you, everyone. We'll see you at CAGNY later this month and look forward to updating you on our progress in May. Please stay well. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.",

In just a moment, Linda will share a few opening comments, and then we'll take your questions. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, including about fiscal year 2023 outlook. These statements are management's current expectations that may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identify various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements, which have been filed with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the non-GAAP financial information section of our earnings release and the supplemental financial schedule in the Investor Relations section of our website for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Now I'll turn it over to Linda. Linda Rendle : Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We delivered strong results in the third quarter and made a challenging operating and cost environment, with organic sales growth in all four segments, gross margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our performance reflects solid execution by our team, the strength and resilience of our portfolio, the superior value of our brands and the relevance of our IGNITE strategy. Based on our strong performance, we're raising our fiscal year outlook. During the quarter, we made great progress through building margin while maintaining top line growth. Net sales grew above our long-term target and we delivered our second consecutive quarter of gross margin improvement supported by cost justified pricing and decade high cost savings. We also made further progress on our IGNITE priorities, investing in our brands and innovation pipeline, while advancing our digital transformation and streamlined operating model to create a stronger, more resilient company. While we're encouraged by our progress to-date, we're relentlessly focused on controlling what we can to drive and appropriately balance both top line and bottom line growth. Looking ahead, we expect the operating environment to remain volatile and challenging. Despite recent moderation in pockets of input costs, overall inflationary headwinds continue to be strong. In light of this and ongoing macro uncertainty, we're watching consumer reactions very closely given the potential for them to come under greater pressure and we are prepared to adapt plans as necessary. Regardless, we have trusted brands and essential categories, which we continue to invest behind. I remain confident that our actions position us well to navigate this environment to deliver consistent profitable growth over time. With that, Kevin and I will take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from Andrea Teixeira. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, operator and good afternoon, everyone. So my question refers a more on the quarter coming in better than anticipated. And Linda, you and Kevin and the team had highlighted that elasticities can kind of came in better. But of course, you're not lapping and not assuming that's going to continue. So you can -- if you can talk a little bit about that? You called out Kingsford being one that you potentially have to work out the price gaps. Any other area that you'd think would be an opportunity? And regarding VMS, just as a clarification, are you putting the asset for sale or just rightsizing it? Kevin Jacobsen : Andrea, this is Kevin. Thank you for the question. Maybe I can start with our expectations for Q4. And as you saw, we delivered 8% organic sales growth in the third quarter, which is stronger than we anticipated. And you may have seen Andrea, in our prepared remarks, there is about 2 points that were one-time in nature, and I'm happy to talk about those. But if I set those aside, we delivered about 6 points organic sales growth. If you look at our outlook for Q4, our full year outlook, and you can back into it. We're projecting about 3% to 6% organic growth. I would say at the high end of that range, it would look very like it did in Q3. We expect continued strong consumption. The business is performing well. I think the one watch out we have and you mentioned it is our Kingsford business. While we had very strong performance in the third quarter, Kingsford was a one business that came in below our expectations. And you may have seen in our prepared remarks, we're seeing an increased level of competitive activity and we're not seeing competition move to the same degree we moved on pricing. That was one of the businesses we priced in December and we've seen price gaps widen and as a result, we saw our shares decline in the third quarter. Now the team with that in mind they've gone back and they've adjusted their plans in Q4, so we're increasing our support for the business in the fourth quarter. But it's certainly something we're watching, and Andrea, you may know this that business has an outsized impact on our fourth quarter. We do about 50% of our total sales in Kingsford happened in the fourth quarter. So it's clearly something we're keeping a close eye on. We think we have good plans in place that we've adjusted to reflect what we learned in Q3, but we're watching that closely, particularly around the key holidays, and it's a little early to tell how Memorial Day or July 4 plays out. And I think if we have a good successful season, we'll be at the top end of that range, which is pretty consistent in Q3. But if it delivers below our expectations, I think that would be a reason why we'd be towards the lower end of the range for the fourth quarter. Linda Rendle : Andrea, I'll take VMS. So as you're all aware, VMS is a small portion of our portfolio. It's about 3% of sales right now and has continued to face challenging market dynamics from a category perspective, what we're seeing coming out of COVID. And then, of course, we've highlighted the performance issues on that business. And we've reassessed that business as it relates to the role it plays in our portfolio. As Kevin highlighted, we're seeing strong results across the majority of our businesses. And we think it's the right step now to look at resource allocation and allocate resources to businesses we think how higher growth potential and therefore, making a bigger focus on profitability in the VMS business. And that's what the team will be laser focused on moving forward. That includes, like I said, moving resources to businesses that have growth potential as well as continuing to narrow our focus on core brands. And we think that's the right role for the business moving forward. Given that, that's what triggered the non-cash impairment, but we feel like we have the right plans moving forward. And as it relates to our portfolio, we're always doing that work with our Board. We'll continue to do that. But right now, we're focused on driving more profitability in the VMS business as we own it today. Andrea Teixeira : That's very helpful. If I can squeeze one question on, if I can, on the wipes business. It seems as if there wasn't any call out of -- it seems that has normalized. Any changes in potentially regaining some shelf space that was lost at the time given the private label taking more share and you didn't have enough capacity, how did that normalize? And anything in the dynamics of the timing of promotions in doing a club or anything that you could call out that happened in the quarter? Linda Rendle : Yeah. Certainly, for wipes, that was a business or one of the business most impacted by COVID. And as we noted, in Q3, we were lapping the Omicron variants and then begin to get to a period where we're more normalized from a COVID perspective with wipes. But it definitely has been bumpy over the last few years as we've gone through that. But we've been very pleased with the performance on the wipes business. We've continually grown share quarter-after-quarter for the last well 12 months over 18 months now on wipes. We've regained significant distribution. Our merchandising plans, while lower than they were pre-pandemic are stronger than they have been and that's behind our ability to supply and we are able to fully supply that business now. And we continue to see consumers turn to us in times of cold and flu. Even with a season that was moved up, we saw strong consumer reaction from a cold and flu perspective. So we feel good about the future of that business. We continue to have a good innovation pipeline. And if you look at our shares, they certainly support the fact that what we thought would happen with all the tertiary brands launched did as we return to strong share leadership and continue to grow that share position. Andrea Teixeira : Very helpful. Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Your next question will come from Peter Grom with UBS. Peter Grom : Thanks, operator and good afternoon, everyone. So maybe just two questions on gross margin. Maybe one more near term and one, looking at longer term. So you've been making some nice sequential progress this year in 3Q of almost 42%, which is quite strong. But the guidance implies a step down in 4Q. So I know there's a lot of noise. If I go back and look at gross margin progression, pre-pandemic, it's pretty rare that you see that sequential step down. So just any color on what may be driving that? Kevin Jacobsen : Hi, Peter. Yeah. Thanks for the question on gross margin. I would not look at it as stepping down in Q4. If I look at our Q3 performance, and as you mentioned, we delivered a 41.8%, there's about 1 point of benefit from the one-time items we highlighted. So if I set that aside, it's sort of an ongoing basis, we're a little under 41%. If you look at our raised outlook for the full year, we're now looking at 38.5% to 39%. You can back into the fourth quarter and now suggest we get to about 40% to 41%. So I would say our fourth quarter is very much in line with what we delivered in the third quarter, if I just set aside the onetime benefit we had. And so we expect the good strong performance we delivered this quarter to continue on into the fourth quarter. Peter Grom : That's super helpful. And then I guess maybe looking out longer term, I recognize being hesitant to provide goalpost around a time line of returning to pre-pandemic profitability. But just looking at the 3Q performance, the 4Q exit rate, the broader trends around inflation. It just does seem like there's -- the light at the end of the tunnel might be approaching faster than anticipated. So I would just love some perspective on the margin recovery? And whether based on what you're seeing right now, whether returning to pre-pandemic levels is in the cards as you look out to next year? Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. Peter, as it relates to gross margin, Lynn and I remain committed to getting back to pre-pandemic levels that's work that's well underway, and we intend to get there. I'm going to be cautious about providing in the outlook for fiscal year '24. We're still in the process of developing our plans. So it's a bit too early for that. But I would say at a high level, you should expect when you see our plans, it will be very much focused on the same priorities we've been driving this year. We're going to continue to drive top line growth. We fully expect to continue to make progress, expanding gross margins and rebuilding them. And then we'll continue to advance our strategic priorities. The challenge with the gross margin, I know there's a lot of interest in exactly when we get to pre-pandemic levels is. On the elements, we control, I feel very good about the progress we're making and we've talked a lot about those drivers. I would say those initiatives are primarily on track or exceeding our expectations. But the reality is there's a real impact from the areas we don't control, either supply chain disruptions or inflation. And as I said in the past, I really think that inflationary component will either accelerate or delay our time to recovery, depending on how that plays out over the next 12 months to 24 months. And I frankly don't think anyone's got a particularly good crystal ball right now to predict that. And so we're going to continue to focus on those things we can control. We're making really good progress. I expect that progress to continue in fiscal year '24. But I think it's a little premature for us to make an exact call on where we think we'll be by the end of '24. Peter Grom : Got it. Thanks so much. I\u2019ll pass it on. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. Thanks, Peter. Operator : Your next question will come from Anna Lizzul with Bank of America. Anna Lizzul : Hi. Thank you very much for the question. To continue the theme on gross margins. I did want to just follow up. Understanding that commodity costs are still a headwind, but directionally keep moving in a better direction and less of a drag on margins here. I mean do you see commodity costs largely stabilizing at this point into fiscal Q4? And then also, do you see a bigger benefit acknowledging that the mix and assortment on margins was a benefit in fiscal Q3, would you expect a bigger benefit on that in fiscal Q4? Thank. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. Thanks, Anna for the question. As it relates to commodity inflation, it is still an inflationary environment. Now it is moderating that level of inflation. But to give you a perspective, in Q1, we had 330 basis points of commodity inflation; in Q3, at 230 basis points. And so we've seen some moderation, but still an inflationary environment. As we've said, resin is a one product rebuy that we are seeing deflation. We've seen that for a good part of the year but that's being more than offset by most of the other products we purchase. And so it continues to be inflationary. We had called about $400 million in total supply chain inflation, about half of that from commodities and half from other areas at the beginning of the year and that still looks like the right call. We still expect about $400 million of inflation. And so I expect to exit this year still operating in an inflationary environment as it relates to commodities. Now as it relates to manufacturing and logistics, I'd say the one area we are starting to see prices come down year-over-year, at least that's our expectations on transportation. It has stabilized in the third quarter. And then our expectations in the fourth quarter, we'll start to see transportation on a year-over-year basis to be lower. But keep in mind, when we talk logistics, there's really three pieces in there. There's transportation, which I think is moving to a deflationary market as we're seeing less demand for goods and more trucks available. But that also includes warehousing and what we call our diesel surcharge and we continue to see inflation in those other two elements. So logistics continue to be a headwind, but transportation piece of logistics, we're starting to see that decline, at least that's our expectation for the fourth quarter. Anna Lizzul : Okay. Thanks very much. And then just on the mix and assortment part of margins, are you expecting to see a better benefit from fiscal Q3 to fiscal Q4? Kevin Jacobsen : I don't. I mean a little bit of the Q3 benefit mix and assortment is our cleaning business, particularly wipes because we're lapping Omicron, our wipes business is down and bigly when you get to large multipacks. And so that was a benefit in the quarter that I expect them to get back down to a more normalized mix of our cleaning portfolio, I would not see that continue in Q4. Anna Lizzul : Great. Thanks very much. Kevin Jacobsen : Thanks, Anna. Operator : Your next question will come from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. So a couple of things on the gross margin side. I guess I wanted to re-ask Peter's question and I understood the answer in terms of on an underlying basis, at least the high end of full year guidance seems fairly similar levels in Q4 -- fiscal Q4 versus fiscal Q3 adjusted. But you did see a lot of sequential improvement in Q3 relative to Q2. And as you mentioned, there are some things getting better in terms of logistics in theory, some of the commodity costs are less of a pressure point next quarter. So just wanted to understand why we wouldn't continue to see a path of sequential improvement, given as we look at fiscal Q3 on an underlying basis, you saw that versus fiscal Q2? And then also, just looking at the underlying performance in fiscal Q3, can you just highlight, based on the pressure points of the individual buckets, where did you come in better than expected versus what you originally expected in fiscal Q3? Thanks. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. Yeah. Thanks, Dara. As it relates to Q4, I'd say the one item I would add to your list and you're exactly right. We expect some moderation in cost inputs as we move from Q3 to Q4. The counterbalance of that is on pricing. We believe Q3 will be the strongest benefit from pricing. As we move into Q4, we're now lapping two price increases, the first two rounds we took. And so I would expect that we'll see less benefit from pricing in Q4, essentially offset by more moderating cost environment. So collectively, we get back to that 40, 41, which is fairly consistent with Q3, seeing a little less inflation and a little less benefit from pricing about offsetting. And then as it relates to Q3, probably the biggest benefit above what we expected is volume deleveraging. We went into the quarter expecting based on elasticities that we would see volumes down in the mid-teens range. And as you saw, our volume was down about 11%. So that stronger top line performance that really drove through the entire P&L. We overdelivered on sales relative to our expectations, but it also contributed to a strong gross margin as well as EPS. So that was really the biggest change versus our expectations. And as I mentioned earlier, Peter, the cost inflation is generally in line with what we expected. That was true for Q3 and we still expect about $400 million of cost inflation for the full year. Dara Mohsenian : Great. That's helpful. And then just on price gaps, you obviously talked about Kingsford, are the plans on Kingsford mainly to adjust promotional spending? Are there other plans as you think about managing that business, particularly heading into the peak season here? And can you discuss if you're comfortable with price gaps elsewhere across the portfolio or are you seeing anything worrisome elsewhere? Thanks. Linda Rendle : Sure. I'll start with the portfolio and then get a little deeper on Kingsford. So from a price gap perspective, the pricing we took a few months ago went generally as expected. And we've seen pockets of price gaps. And frankly, we're still closing some of those, and we've adjusted some of our plans on the businesses where we've had issues. For the most part, our price gaps are in line to where we expected them to be. Kingsford, as you call out is the biggest gap that we have right now as competition did not follow that price increase in full. And that's one that we are making adjustments to our plan, and we have those already beginning to show up in market in Q4. Part of that would be trade related. We're ensuring we have the right merchandising plans to support the right price points, but we're also focused on market baskets with retailers, which is one of the biggest opportunities given the overall basket for the consumer in the drilling space is under pressure with protein prices being up, and of course, the rest of the things that go on the grill. So we're focused on supporting those enhanced merchandising plans, and we'll expect to see that play out as we head into Q4. That being said, though, we are laser-focused on any price gap issues that we have in pockets and we have plans ready to adjust, and we will do that on select other areas of our portfolio where we continue to see gaps. But what I'd say is there's so much noise as prices fluctuate and as promotion starts to come back into the marketplace that we're being incredibly cautious to ensure that we have the right value for our brands and maintain that superior brand value with consumers but not get ahead of ourselves from a trade perspective. And I think that balance has been working, and we'll continue to do that in Q4 and beyond as we manage price gaps. Dara Mohsenian : Great. That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : Your next question will come from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Filippo Falorni : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Question on pricing. You mentioned obviously in Q4, you're going to cycle some of the price increases from last year. You still have the December price increase flowing through. So can you give us a sense of magnitude or the sequential change in pricing that you're thinking for Q4? And then longer term, you've talked in the past about shifting from list price increases towards more price back at capture. So can you give us a sense of the potential contribution from those initiatives as we look to fiscal '24 and beyond? Thank you. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. Hi, Filippo. As it relates to Q4, I won't give a buy line forecast for the fourth quarter, but you should expect that the price benefit to margin we saw in Q3 is a high watermark this year. And then now as we really start lapping that second price increase, you'll start to see that pull back. I'd say more in the range, somewhere in that Q1 to Q2 range, generally in that area. So we'll see that start to step down. And that should continue to play out that way for the next three quarters until we fully lap the last round of pricing we took in December, it will continue to step down in value over time. And then your question on list price changes, I think you may have read in our prepared remarks, we do not have any additional large scale pricing in our plans for the balance of this fiscal year. We will continue to work on place back architecture (ph) changes. And then we'll evaluate we're developing our plans for '24. So we'll come back to you in August and we'll share more details about our plans about how much would be pricing and how we would execute that pricing is a little too early to have that conversation. What I would say though, maybe longer term is, I think as we get through this inflationary cycle and we get back to an appropriate level of margins, I would expect us to get back to a more normalized level of how we grow the top line, which is more volume dependent and we'll continue to focus on innovation, consumer trade-up and some price back architecture be much more volume driven than price mix driven and so I think you'll see that evolve over time. But we're still very much in the mode where it's being more driven by price mix and I expect that to continue for another three quarters until we lap all this pricing. Filippo Falorni : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Hi, everybody. In the prepared remarks, Linda, you talked about, you\u2019ve been please with market share performance and I was -- Linda\u2019s, readily apparent on a dollar basis. But I was just curious how much you guys think about volume share and whether or not that's a metric that's important to you, it's something you focus on? And then, I have a follow-up related to that after I kind of hear the answer. Linda Rendle : Sure, Lauren. So on share overall, we were happy to maintain share in aggregate, and we grew share in five of our nine businesses and continue to grow share in the growth markets around the world. That being said, of course, our goal is to grow share and I've been transparent about that, that we're not satisfied into that zone, but we are really pleased to see given the level of pricing that we've taken that our shares have held up. And of course, we are talking about dollar share, and if you recall, earlier, we were growing volume share pretty steadily as pricing had fully taken hold in our categories, and that was something that we were looking at, too. So Lauren, we're balancing both of them. Our focus is usually on dollar share as the primary metric that we want to focus on. We think that convey as well our overall superior value and how we think about consumers thinking about value in the category and dollar share is a better representative of that. But again, we are watching volume and unit share to see how consumers are making decisions, et cetera. The good news is that because the categories have mainly moved in line with us with some exceptions, Kingsford being notably, you're seeing adjustments in volume share that in some places are larger, but most of the time in line and just have to do with normalizing price gaps. So we watch it, primary metric is dollar share. Happy to see where we are and happy to be growing in five to nine businesses, but the work is certainly not done yet. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Great. And then so when I was thinking about gross margin and Kevin had mentioned it briefly about the operating deleverage and it was better this quarter than expected, but it's still a headwind to gross margin. As you think forward, what should we be thinking about in terms of volumes, stable at newer lower level, albeit give all the pricing (ph), is it volume growth? Because [Technical Difficulty] how should we think about where the business is geared to on an absolute volume performance basis such that if we're really talking about restoring gross margins versus pre-pandemic levels. We often be mindful of where volumes stand relative to that pre-pandemic period? Kevin Jacobsen : Lauren, I'd say a few things on volume. I think one thing that continues to benefit is, as you know, is we chose to use contract manufacturers mean that significant spike, so we did not overbuild our facilities that allowed us to, as volume moderated we were able to set those agreements down and not be left with a lot of unused capacity internally. And so I think that's benefited us. I think -- as I mentioned, I think to Filippo, as we move forward now, depending on where pricing goes in fiscal year '24, but given the pricing we've taken, I would expect price mix to continue to moderate and the volume declines to moderate as well as we cycle through this pricing. And so as I said, short of any future pricing being taken, I think we've probably got a three more quarters or so, we're seeing price/mix driving the top line to a greater extent of volume. But I think that will level and balance out as we look further out into our fiscal year '24 and so I think that's when we get to a more steady state of volume. And what we try to do is be thoughtful about ensuring we're building our manufacturing capacity to be in line with these plans and not getting ahead of ourselves. And so that's the work we've been doing with our supply chain team to try to make sure we don't end up in a position where once we get to the steady state, we've got too much capacity in our facilities. I think we're in pretty good shape, but that's something we continue to evaluate and continue to adjust our plans. But certainly, it's something we're keeping a close eye on. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Great. And then final question. I was just in the expenses excluded from earnings this quarter and then the outlook set in the operating model changes that just things are moving more quickly, so higher expenses in this year, but no change to the overall program. But on the digital expenses, they are higher. And so you're now excluding, I think it's an additional $0.07 or something like that. So I'd just be curious if we could explain a little bit what's the incremental? Is it just the estimated cost of the program has gone up? Is there an incremental savings, just curious about that change? Kevin Jacobsen : Yea. Sure. Thanks for the question. As it relates to our digital transformation that program is very much on track. As you know, it's a five year program, and we plan to spend $500 million, no change in our expectation. We are seeing a little bit of a shifting between years. This is the second year of the five-year program. We started the year out, expecting we spend about $150 million, $90 million of OpEx, about $60 million of CapEx and that $90 million equates to about $0.55. We have now raised our total spending to about $160 million, so from $150 million to $160 million. And that's just a little bit of shift in timing between years. We're not changing the overall expected spend as a result of pulling a little bit of that forward into fiscal year '23, we've raised our expectation about $10 million and that's that $0.07 you mentioned, Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Thank you so much. Sorry for all the questions. Kevin Jacobsen : Thanks, Lauren. Operator : And our next question will come from Olivia Tong with Raymond James Financial. Olivia Tong : Great. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on advertising and your view on reinvestment levels, especially with A&P up pretty substantially in Q3. So we certainly saw some nice acceleration following the gross margin improvement. So just wondering on your views going forward if gross margin continues to recover ahead of your expectations, where do you think advertising goes? And then just a follow-up on that. This is the biggest increase in advertising margin that on a year-over-year basis in quite a few years. So can you talk about where the incremental spend was and your view on the ability to generate the same level of ROI on that spend versus what you're going and expectations were? Linda Rendle : Sure, Olivia. Advertising continues to be an incredibly important part of how we support the superior value of our brands. We believe fundamentally in it. And it's why we've done everything to continue to maintain spending what we think is about the right level over a year, which is about 10% of sales and we'll continue to be on track for doing that this year. As you noted, Q3 was significantly higher than other quarters and that's given innovation that we launch and timing of merchandising. And again, we don't manage quarter-to-quarter, but this was the right time to spend this money to support our brands. And coincides with having our fourth price increase in the market, which is good timing. We continue to believe that about 10% is the right spending, but we adjust that and look at that depending on what the businesses require. And we're not afraid to move or adjust that moving forward. But again, right now, about 10%, we're on track to do that for the year. And if you look at our ROI on marketing, it has been terrific and is another reason why we continue to feel strongly that, that investment contributes to the value creation that we can get from our brands. And our focus, as you know, has been on improving our ROI given the fact that we are driving personalization. So we wanted to get to know 100 million consumers in the U.S. And what getting to know 100 million consumers does is it allows you to know them better and it allows you to personalize to them. And we've had the added benefit of driving efficiency and effectiveness by doing that. So we're getting the right people, the right message at the right time and spending our money more effectively. And if you look across the advertising we said in our prepared remarks that, that was more heavily concentrated in the U.S. where we had lots of good opportunities. and was pretty widespread across our businesses. And you saw the strength across all segments with organic sales growth across all four. And again, as we head into fiscal year '24, we'll let you know what we think the right level of advertising spending will be, but you can hear that our commitment to that as the way we create value remains steadfast. Olivia Tong : Got it. That's helpful. And then I just have a few specific questions on Kingsford. If you could just remind us first where Kingsford margins stand relative to company average. And then obviously, a lot of pricing this quarter. How much of that pricing acceleration that you saw in Q3 was driven by Kingsford versus the other brands where you saw competition in follow (ph) pricing? Kevin Jacobsen : Olivia, I'll answer on gross margin and we don't provide gross margin at individual brand level, but it's a nice profitable contributor to the company. And I'm sorry, can you repeat your second question? I'm not sure that was tracking. Olivia Tong : Sure. Would you mind just giving us a sense in terms of Kingsford relative to company average then? And then also, how much of that pricing acceleration that you saw in Q3 was driven by Kingsford versus other brands where you did see the competition follow your pricing? Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. On the margin, we don't share other than I'll just give you direct message, it\u2019s a nice business for us and so we're quite happy when we get increased sales in Kingsford. As it relates to pricing, I would say I'm not sure I fully understand your question. But I would say overall, Kingsford is not as large in Q3, your question about how Kingsford usually contributed to pricing. As I mentioned earlier, we do about 50% of our sales in our fourth quarter on the Kingsford business, so it has a very outsized impact on the company. But in Q3, that's really early season for Kingsford. And so it's less meaningful in terms of the impact it has on our performance. Olivia Tong : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question will come from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Chris Carey : Hi, everyone. Linda Rendle : Hi, Chris. Chris Carey : So I'm just digesting a lot of the questions on this earnings call around sequential momentum in gross margin, which was great. It sounds like the underlying momentum will continue into Q4. I guess the question I want to ask is just philosophy on investment, right, because of this gross margin trajectory continues and you don't materially step up spending, you're going to be looking at a very, very significant year of earnings growth in fiscal '24, right? And I know you're not going to comment on fiscal '24, but certainly, this is the reality when you flow through these gross margins to the model. And I think these questions on investment are well taken and where you want to spend. But if 10% of sales is the right number, then it would imply that you're going to be spending an enormous amount on S&A? And I guess, just maybe help us understand where the types of areas where you might want to lean in, if you're now clearly over delivering on the gross margin line? If not an advertising? Are there areas of SG&A that you felt like have been underinvested in that you have opportunity over the next four to six quarters as if you look at the normalization of the P&L over the next couple of years? And just connected to that, there's been this target of 13% estimate as a percentage of sales out there. Is that still a relevant target over the near to medium term? Thanks, Rendle. Linda Rendle : Sure, Chris. I'll start and then ask if Kevin wants to add anything after I finish. Just maybe taking a step back in what we're trying to accomplish. And we talked about the balance that we want to strike between maintaining top line growth and rebuilding margins and ensuring given the incredibly volatile and uncertain environment that we're taking all the actions we can control to do both of those things. And we are pleased with the progress that we've made on both of them. If you look at our growth, if you look at any kind of three-year average over quarters, et cetera., it puts us at the top end of our growth algorithm and then we're making nice progress on margin. I think Kevin highlighted why Q3 between onetime less deleveraging than we expected, what we expect in Q4, really happy with the margin performance that it's nothing that we should expect as outsized in Q4. Obviously not providing a fiscal year '24 outlook, but let me just give you how we're thinking about the environment and what's going on out there. We want to continue to maintain that balance on top line growth and margin improvement. We still think it's a multiyear journey to rebuild margins. And we think the uncertainty from a consumer perspective in '24 is going to continue to remain high. And that's very difficult to predict right now exactly what the inflationary environment will look like when -- if we will hit a recession, and then, of course, what the corresponding impact will be to the consumer. And it is very likely that they could become under more pressure. And so what we're taking this out is another good quarter. We need to continue to control or controlling. We want to continue that into fiscal year '24. And then we want to make the right investments to your good point to support that business. And we believe in advertising, supporting innovation, which we continue to feel very strongly about ensuring we have the right capital plans against our business, which we feel we do. And we'll look at all of those hard in '24 to make sure that we're making the right choices. And we're not afraid to invest if we need to, to support both that top line growth and rebuilding margins. We'll have more specifics, of course, and we talk to you again in August about what that means for '24. But just know that the posture we're going into is we're committed to that margin growth, committed to maintaining top line and then making all the necessary adjustments to do that at the right pace. Chris Carey : Okay. Thanks for that. That's a very fair just on the -- just one quick follow-up on Olivia's question. The way I understood it was, did Kingsford atypically contribute the pricing in Q3. And as such, to get back in Q4. I'm not exactly sure that's what you meant, but that was the question I had. So I figured it ask you as well. Thanks so much. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. Chris, on pricing, as I think you may recall, we took pricing pretty broadly across our portfolio in December. So Kingsford was one of a number of brands repriced. And so as I said, Kingsford did not have an outsized impact and because it is low season, it had fairly small impact. So I don't expect to see any meaningful change in Q4 as it relates to the pricing we took and specifically what Kingsford contributed to that pricing overall because again, pricing is just one brand and we priced a good portion of our portfolio in December. Chris Carey : Okay. Thanks so much. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Operator : Your next question will come from Javier Escalante with Evercore ISI. Javier Escalante : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. My question has to do with SG&A and if you could, first, operationally, tell us what you have accomplished on this digital investment that you are making financially is $0.63. It's been excluded of consensus what is reasonable to think as recurring cost going into fiscal '24? Linda Rendle : Hi, Javier. I'll start just with a reminder of what our digital program entails and how we're thinking about it. And then if there's any specifics we want to provide, Kevin can talk about the specifics of the spend for this year and how we're thinking about it moving forward. So we're investing, as you know, $500 million to transform our company digitally. And this, of course, is putting in the right technologies, including a new ERP, but it really is around changing the processes and the work that everyone at Clorox does to be faster and simpler. And we see this supporting both our top line momentum as we put in place innovation capabilities, better access to consumer data to drive insights and speed of decision-making as well as efficiencies as we have the ability to look across our supply chain and make decisions that reduce costs. This investment is on track. I think Kevin highlighted that to begin with. We'll see differences year-to-year. We're in the second year of the program, but the team continues to be on track implementing against that. What we've said is, most of the investment is upfront, but you get the majority of the benefit as you start to exit our IGNITE strategy or in 2025. And that's because you're putting all of those capabilities and technologies in place and changing how the entire company works and operates. And then we continue to be on track for that. This is a very high-return project for us. When Kevin and I evaluated this, we looked at the return and we track that project by project to ensure we're getting that return, and we continue to be on track to deliver good value on this over the long term. As it comes to specifics, we talked about in our release that we are about to implement the first region of our ERP coming up this calendar year. That is on track. -- as well as some of the other technology improvements that we've made. And of course, we have paired that with an operating model change that is also on track and in fact, a little bit ahead from a cost savings perspective this year as we were able to implement some of those changes faster. But those two things in combination are really about being fast, simple and more cost effective company that we -- that we want to be and to develop the type of resiliency and strength we can to weather whatever comes our way, another pandemic or whatever else the macroeconomic or geopolitical environment throws our way. Javier Escalante : So just to clarify, there is no recurring cost associated with the $0.63 in digital spending that you are making in fiscal '23? Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. Hi, Javier. As it relates to the spending, what will happen is the $500 million is the cost, the investment to put these new systems in place. I think through the end of this year, we'll be a little less than halfway through that spend. So it will be somewhere around $230 million, $240 million. And then that will continue as we complete the program over the next three years. That's the one-time investment with this in place. Now there are all ongoing maintenance costs, which we have in our legacy systems now that when those get shut off, there will be ongoing maintenance costs for a cloud-based system that we'll continue to pay. But the $500 million is the cost of the investment in this technology to get it put in place. Javier Escalante : That's very helpful. And if you changing topics, if you can comment underlying category growth on a volume basis so we can compare it versus your 11% decline now that Omicron is behind us? And if you can give that assessment of volume category growth when it comes to your household penetration, Clorox products versus 2019? Thank you very much. Linda Rendle : As you would expect, given the elasticities of what we spoke about and the fact that our pricing is generally in line with category pricing, category volumes were down, and we've absolutely expected that to be the case. If you look at dollar sales, so if you look at consumption, high-single digits in our categories, which continues to show the strength and resilience of the consumer in our categories. Given we compete in Essentials, this is something that we expected. We're watching really closely as the consumer continues to react to pricing and as they continue to react to the macroeconomic environment. But right now feeling very good about the category position that we're in and consumer response to pricing. Generally, we would expect over time as we begin to lap category pricing and see category volumes return and get to that place where you see low-single digit growth in our categories from a volume perspective over time. We are certainly not at that point right now. as we have nine more months to lap pricing. And then, of course, we'll see what plays out from a commodity perspective and any required pricing that happens in the future that would also impact that. The only other thing that I would say as it relates to pricing and you think about volumes. We're not seeing that type of trade down either as it relates to consumers making choices for private label, et cetera. That's been pretty steady. As we highlighted earlier, our shares in aggregate, are flat. We grew in five of nine categories. We have seen private label increase share a bit in some of our categories, but it's not coming from us. It looks like it's coming from other brands and that there is a simplifying of the category, and it all relates to the value that we offer consumers 76% of our portfolio is still deem secure by consumers. We've continued to invest in that. So volume is what we expect in the categories. And again, we expect that to bounce back over time as we continue to invest in innovation and advertising and in category growth plans with our retailers. Javier Escalante : And the household penetration statistics, do you have them? Linda Rendle : Sure. Yeah. On Household penetration is still very high for the Clorox portfolio. We're still in about nine out of 10 homes, and as we spoke about last quarter, household penetration is something we expect to decline in a time when you take extraordinary pricing. But that's not a clock phenomenon. It is a category phenomenon. And what you see is people using those more price sensitive behaviors. They're letting a trash bag, fill longer. They're stretching their time in between cleanings they're doing those things to make their wallet stretch, and that results in usually category penetration declining and we are seeing that. What I would say, though, is we see no difference in our brands versus the category, and we would expect over time to rebuild category penetration as we rebuild volumes. Javier Escalante : That\u2019s all for me. Thank you very much. Very helpful. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Javier. Operator : We'll hear next from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Stephen Robert : Very thanks. Actually, it's a good lead in. I just wanted to pick up on that household penetration discussion. Last quarter, we were talking about it. And I think the framing was that you were looking to rebuild household penetration over the course of 2024 and then looking longer term, obviously. Just in response to, I think, to Lauren's question earlier on volume growth, Kevin, your response, if I heard it correctly, you emphasized stabilization of volumes. So I just want to marry you kind of tie those two things together and make sure I'm grounded in the right takeaway because if we're rebuilding household penetration over the course of '24, I think that implies positive volume, whereas you emphasized stabilization of volume. I know it's maybe splitting hairs, but just wanted to think of -- just kind of understand how you're thinking about it? Maybe it's a progression over the course of '24, but just -- so I don't walk away the wrong impression. Thank you. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah, Steve. Thanks for the question. As it relates to volumes, I think for the next three quarters, given that the pricing we just took in December, we would expect to [indiscernible] volumes decline and view with grow top line based on price mix as we get past that pricing and assume we don't have any other large-scale pricing in our plan, then I think the balances start switching. And as we target that 3% to 5% top line growth, you're driving that more through volume versus price mix. So then I think it reverses and then volume starts to be the primary driver of our top line, supplemented with our innovation and trading consumers up, but more volume driven as we target 3% to 5% over the long term. . But I think we\u2019re probably still a number of quarters away before we get to that more stable environment. We\u2019ll return to a more traditional model of top line being more driven by volume and price mix. Stephen Robert : Okay. Thank you very much. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question will come from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey. Good afternoon, folks. Thanks for sorting me in. A couple of questions. Let's start with maybe the trade down. To Lauren's question earlier, you're clearly losing some volume share in a number of categories. You're seeing usage occasions like they're not going through cheaper products, their trade down. Where are you seeing those lost usage occasions out of your brand? Like, where is it going, if it's not going to it's a trade down? Linda Rendle : Yeah, Jason. It's very dependent on category the consumer behavior. But what I would say is we noticed big buckets of the following : First, we see consumers trading to larger sizes, and they're looking for the best cost per use, for example. We also see certain consumers trading down to lower sizes because they're looking for the lowest out-of-pocket price point, and they're willing to pay on a higher per use basis because they only have a certain amount of money to get them through their shopping cycle for that period of time. We're also seeing people trade within our portfolio, for example, so where somebody might use a more expensive cleaner, they are using a dilutable cleaner or a bleach cleaner and willing to put more elbow grease in to get that same amount of clean and trade off that pricing convenience. And then we're seeing behaviors and this is really consistent across the category where people are just trying to stretch something more. So they're getting every less spray out of a bottle. They are using a wipe longer, they're stuffing a trash bag, and that's pretty consistent across the category. But really, those 3 1st buckets are the really important ones as we see people trade into different sizes and then, of course, adjust their behavior. And the good news for us is, in many cases, we're able to capture that consumer because we offer different levels of convenience, for example, in our cleaning business. Jason English : Okay. And Kevin, can you -- you mentioned a couple of sort of onetime transitory benefits this quarter. Can you remind me what they were and quantify them? And then related, maybe do the adjusted math on this. Gross profit, we're all benchmarking is pre-COVID, right? How you -- as you are, too, when you mentioned like recovery to margins, your gross profit, I think, was up adjusted 19% versus 3Q '19. And cumulative volume growth of three, suggesting that unit economics are up a lot, like 15.5% versus pre-COVID. And almost to Chris' question, like, why you hold this? Like you're going to blow through a $3.2 billion, $3.3 billion gross profit next year at that level. So what is anything unusual or is that like -- that's it, your unit economics are that much better and we can run rate this? Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah, Jason. The two questions, I think the first question you had was onetime benefits in the quarter. We had two. The first one was on trade spending. We have a normal process at the end of the second quarter. We evaluate our trade spending accrual. In this case, we're not seeing the promotional environment increased at the rate we expected. So we reduced our trade spending accrual. That was a onetime benefit in the quarter. . And then the other onetime benefit was one of our competitors had an out of stock in our dilutable category. And so our Pine saw business saw a pretty nice performance, double-digit growth as a result of that out of stock. Now the combination is back on shelves. So we don't expect that to continue back to a more normalized level of competition. So those two items are the ones we highlighted is fairly unique for the quarter that we don't expect to continue into Q4. That generated about 2 points of top line benefit and about 100 basis points of margin benefit for the quarter. And then on unit economics, yes, we're in mean rebuilding gross margins and we are going to be. We expect to be a much larger company than we were before the pandemic. We went into the pandemic with a little over $6 billion in sales. As you know, we're seeing a little over $7 billion right now. So you would expect gross profit to be higher because as we rebuild gross margins, and we are a bigger company that will generate more gross profit. So ultimately, we expect that to occur as we rebuild margins over time. But as Linda said, we think that's a multiyear journey to get there. We'll have to see how much progress we make in '24, we're developing those plans right now. But that is certainly our intent is to rebuild gross margin and have the results or the impact of gross profit as it relates to a larger company. Jason English : Okay. Yeah. It sounds like this is a good benchmark. It's a run rate then. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Kevin Jacobsen : Thanks, Jason. Operator : And your next question will come from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Great. Thanks,. Good afternoon, A couple for me, a cleanup on the SG&A, Kevin, I apologize if I missed this. It looks like your SG&A on an underlying basis, ex the digital moved up about 50 basis points from your prior guidance. What's driving that? Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. Kevin, if you just -- I'll talk Q3 and talk full year. So in Q3, a little over 16%. We had a couple of items. We had the digital transformation, which we highlighted is about 150 basis points. We also had about 40 basis points from our operating model changes. A portion of those restructuring set in SG&A, a portion sits in link. And so you're seeing some of that flow through in SG&A. And then the other one was we have higher expected incentive compensation. We have a very strong pay-for-performance philosophy. And as we've taken our goals up for the year. We expect our incentive compensation will be higher as well. So we baked that in. So as a result, we went from 15% to 16% was our expectation last quarter and now we're expecting closer to 16% for the year. Kevin Grundy : Got it. A couple more for me real quick. Just to walk from like the 14.5% this year to 13% ambition longer-term understanding it's going to take some time to get there. But sort of broad brush strokes, what gets you from 14.5% this year to 13.5% over a reasonable amount of time? Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. I would say one is, if you just get to a normalized level of incentive compensation, it's going to be above target is our expectation this year. But if you just go back to a target payout, you pick up 40 to 50 bps there. And then our expectation, you start looking at the operating model we talked about, so $75 million to $100 million. We're going to generate about $35 million of our expectation this year, but that's a nice contributor as you look at '24 and beyond. And then you start getting the benefits from our digital transformation. We're still very early in that process. But over time, as we bring a new technology online, we're going to see more productivity opportunities. And so collectively, when you look at all that together, that's the path for how we believe we get to 13% as we look forward over the next several years. Kevin Grundy : Got it. Thank you, Kevin. One quick follow-up, if I can. I was going to ask on trade promotion and it kind of came up end of your response. Again, like from our perspective, hard to gauge sort of order of magnitude with the decision to take down the accrual. But I think like collectively everyone on the call would think promotion levels moving higher and not lower, and I guess, particularly in your categories. So I was going to -- a question for both of you. I was going to ask Linda just how you're thinking about freight promotion risk around that? Are you starting to have those conversations already? Are retailers starting to push already? They see what's going on with resin and inflation more broadly. They see what's happening with this gross margin start to inflect. Are you starting to get more pressure there? And Kevin, maybe you could just jump in and sort of comment on the decision to take down a trade accrual with the likelihood the trade promotion is going to move higher over the next 12 months? And then I can pass it on. Thank you for that. Linda Rendle : Sure, Kevin. We're continuing to see the promotional environment normalize. And the dynamic that happened is we expect the promotional environment to increase this quarter but did not increase as much as we expected. And that's a dynamic and then Kevin can talk about the accrual as it relates to that. As we look just broader, though, in the environment on promotion, that stays a very specific role for our categories. We talked about in the past that more than 90% of our business is done off the shelf with no pricing discount and promotion plays a role to ensure that we talk to consumers about innovation. We talked to them around key holidays and pulse points where consumers are looking, for example, back-to-school or back to college or around cold and flu. And we use that to ensure that we're speaking to consumers about our products, the values they offer and new innovation. That continues to be the focus that we have on the promotional environment, and those are the discussions we continue to have with retailers. We're not afraid to use promotional dollars if we have price gaps that we need to adjust on a temporary basis, and we will do that. We are doing that right now, as we have a couple of price gaps that are out of line that we spoke to earlier. But generally, Primo continues to be a strategic investment lever for us to ensure that we're in front of the consumer when we need to be and when it matters from an innovation and pulse point period. perspective. Kevin Jacobsen : And then I would just add as it relates to the trade accrual specifically and Linda said it well, which is it's not that we expect tradesmen to go down. It's just not growing at the rate we expected. We -- before the pandemic, about 25% of our product was sold in some form of promotion. In our most recent quarter is at 20%. And if I look at Q3 a year it goes at 19%. So it is increasing. We expect that we get back to more of that pre-pandemic level faster. And so the reduction in accrual is just recognizing it's not as growing as fast as we had anticipated, but we do expect to continue to increase. Kevin Grundy : Understood. Thank you., both. I appreciate it. Good luck. Kevin Jacobsen : Thanks, Keving. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle, I'd now like to turn the program back to you. Linda Rendle : Thank you, everyone. We look forward to speaking with you again on our next call in August. And until then, please stay well. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Clorox Company Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations, for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. Lisah Burhan : Thanks, Ross. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Linda Rendle, our CEO, and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. I hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. In just a moment, Linda will share a few opening comments, and then we'll take your questions. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, including about our fiscal 2024 outlook. These statements are based on management's current expectations, but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements, which has been filed with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the non-GAAP financial information section of our earnings release and the supplemental financial schedules in the Investor Relations section of our website for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Now I'll turn it over to Linda. Linda Rendle : Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We closed out fiscal year 2023 with strong results, underscoring the significant progress we've made against our strategic priorities. Over the course of the year, we've been relentlessly focused on driving top-line growth and rebuilding margins in a challenging operating environment, while continuing to invest in the long-term health of our brands, categories and capabilities. Thanks to our team's strong execution across a comprehensive set of actions, we delivered on these commitments. For fiscal year 2023, we generated net sales growth of 4%, within our long-term target, gross margin expansion of 360 basis points and adjusted EPS growth of 24%. Our performance reflects our commitment to driving operational excellence and margin improvements, supported by the strength and resilience of our portfolio and the relevance of our IGNITE strategy. In addition to delivering results over the short term, we made progress on our IGNITE strategy. The investments we're making to deliver consumer inspired innovation, strengthen the superior value of our brands, advance our digital transformation and streamline our operating model, are positioning us to drive long-term profitable growth. As we look ahead to fiscal year 2024, we are clear on our priorities. While we expect the environment to remain difficult with macroeconomic uncertainty persisting, we are committed to building on our progress and have plans to enhance our value superiority at a time when it matters most to consumers. We believe these actions will enable us to continue to drive top-line growth and rebuild margins back to pre-pandemic levels and put us in a position to grow share and household penetration over the long term. I'm confident we're taking the appropriate actions to build a stronger, more resilient company positioned to win in the marketplace, deliver on our operational and financial goals, and create long-term value for stakeholders. With that, Kevin and I will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. Please go ahead, Peter. Peter Grom : Thanks, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. So I wanted to ask two related questions on the top-line. Maybe first, I know you called out stronger shipments in cleaning and some early shipments for back to school, but the minus 2% volume performance was certainly stronger than what we can see in the track data. Was that largely due to the shipment timing that you mentioned, or is there strength elsewhere that's not being captured by the data? And then just second on the organic sales guidance of 2% to 4%. You mentioned a mild US recession in the back half, you provided some color on phasing starting with mid-single digit growth in 1Q. I just would be curious to get your perspective on the balance of pricing versus volume in that outlook, specifically, as we move through the year. And do you expect volume growth at some point in the back half? Thanks. Linda Rendle : Hi, Peter. I'll start with your first question then I'll hand it over to Kevin. So on Q4, over-delivery versus what we had expected, as we noted, we did see stronger consumption across the board across our categories in aggregate. And that's a result of two things, mainly. The first being elasticities continue to be better than they have been historically. And that's an aggregate comment. You know, we see differences by category, but in aggregate, they're favorable and trade promo has been normalizing at a slower pace than we'd expect. And we'll continue to see that normalize as we go through fiscal year 2024, but for Q4, it wasn't to the degree that we thought it would be. So that's -- that's the first bucket, stronger consumption. The second is, better operational performance by our team, and that's just a broad statement across the supply chain. We were able to make some supply that we didn't think we would have. Our shipments to retailers were stronger than we had expected. Just a lot of the things operationally came together with great execution and supported that growth. And then finally in Kingsford, and we spoke about in Q3, we did not perform to our expectations in Q3. We made significant adjustments to the plan, including working with retailers on category growth plans, centered in having the right merchandising and those performed significantly better than we had expected, which was great to see and the consumer reacted very favorably and retailers executed with excellence. And those are really the big three main buckets between what we saw, and what we expected. Kevin Jacobsen : And then, Peter, I can talk about the -- our plans for fiscal year \u201824 as it relates to sales. And as you saw, we're projecting 2% to 4% for the year. If you think about the front half and the back half, our expectations are sales to be closer to mid-single digits in the front half, excuse me, and then low single digits in the back half. And that phasing from front half to back half, I'd call out a few items. The first is, as you saw in our prepared remarks, we're projecting a mild recession in the back half of our fiscal year, which would be the front half of calendar year \u201824. So we think that will put a little bit of pressure on consumers in our categories, and we've reflected that in our outlook. The other item to be aware of is we are now going to lap the four rounds of pricing we've taken when we get to the middle of the year. So that fourth price increase we took last December, we will lap that when we get halfway through the year. So the second half of the year, we'll now have lapped all the pricing we've taken. So as a result of that, what we expect to see is you'll see improving volume trends as we move through the year, and you'll see the benefit of price mix larger in the front half and then really start to tail off in the back half. And so as we get that that low single digit growth, it'll be a combination of some price mix because we're still doing a little bit of pricing internationally, improving volume trends, but recognizing we still think it's going to be a difficult economic environment for consumers. Peter Grom : Thank you, both. I'll pass it on. Operator : And our next question comes from Anna Lizzul from Bank of America. Please go ahead, Anna. Anna Lizzul : Good afternoon. Thanks very much for the question. In your fiscal \u201824 guidance, you are expecting a flat to 2% net sales growth. This is a little bit below your long-term algorithm from your IGNITE strategy of that 3% to 5% annual sales growth. I was wondering if you can comment on, when you expect to return to the 3% to 5% net sales growth on a more normalized basis? And in addition, what do you see as the drivers of really achieving that sales growth longer term? Thank you. Linda Rendle : Yeah. 2% to 4% percent organic sales growth and 0% to 2% from a reported is what we're expecting now. And that is slightly below what we want from a long-term perspective. But, just to put that in perspective, of course, if you look at our four-year CAGR and our strategy period, we did deliver in the midpoint of that range at 4% and again, 4% this year. This year coming up is a kind of a tale of two halves, is the way I would talk about it. And we expect stronger growth in the front half as we continue to lap the two price increases that we have. And then in the back half, we expect it to get tougher for consumers. And right now, our expectation is a mild recession. So when you put those things together, I think in aggregate, we feel good about the top-line that we've committed to. In addition, that includes about 1 point of a headwind from our vitamins, minerals, and supplements business. As we spoke about, over the last couple of calls, we have re-engineered that plan to focus more on profitability, and we've done that at a trade-off from a top-line perspective. So that does include a 1 point headwind. And, over time, we would expect that that wouldn't be the case and that, that would help us return to getting in within that 3% to 5%. The way that I would think about this, as we march through the year, we are expecting, again, lapping two price increases, we are expecting our elasticities to be more normalized as we go through the course of the year. We're expecting trade promotion to normalize as well, and then we're expecting a mild recession in the back half. Those are all of our assumptions in forming that growth. And if those come true, we feel this plan is a very balanced plan, but we'll be watching really carefully as we move through the year. If any one of those assumptions change, and we need to adjust our plan, that could impact both, on the high end and the lower end of us delivering against what we put out there from an outlook perspective. Anna Lizzul : Thank you. And just wanted to ask a follow-up on just on marketing spend versus promotional levels, you've mentioned that advertising as a percent of sales, you intend to spend about 11% in fiscal \u201824 versus about 10% in fiscal \u201823. Do you feel this is the right level of investment given a ramp in marketing spend versus some peers in the space? And also just in terms of the balance of advertising spend versus promotional in fiscal \u201924, it does sound like you're ramping back up on promotional levels. And is this an intention to get back to pre-COVID levels with promotion as well? Thanks. Linda Rendle : Sure. So on the marketing spend, as you rightly noted, we've spent about 10% of sales on advertising and sales promotion over our history. And there's times we've spent more than that. This year, we're targeting 11% and we think that's a prudent investment given the pressure the consumer is going to be under from a macroeconomic perspective, the fact that we are coming off of four rounds of pricing, significant price increase, obviously cost justified, but we want to continue to support the consumer as they transition through that. And so we think 11% is the right number. And you have two data points that give us confidence that 11% is the right number. During the pandemic, we took our advertising spending up, even at a time when we couldn't fully supply. That increase in advertising led to stronger superiority ratings for our brands, and that gave us the confidence to take the four rounds of pricing that we took. So we think again, in a time where consumers are pressured and stressed, investing that additional point of advertising makes a lot of sense. And then the second data point I would give you is that we've been on a journey to get to know 100 million consumers in the US, and that allows us to personalize to them, which was part of our IGNITE strategy. We've nearly met that goal, and that has led to a return on investment in our advertising being the highest it ever was. We reached a high point year. So we feel really good about putting that extra point in because we know what we're going to get from a returns perspective in addition to supporting the superiority of our brands. And again, we'll continue evaluate this moving forward. Doesn't mean it will necessarily be 11% the year after. This is really a roll up of what we think our general managers need to best support our brands during this time. And then from a promotion perspective, promotions continue to be lower than they were pre-pandemic, but are ramping up. Our expectation is throughout the course of the year, we'll return to more normalized promotions, so similar to what we were pre-pandemic. And, we've assumed to be fair, though, this year, it would ramp up faster and it hasn't. But based on what we're seeing in the data, we think that's a fair assumption. And again, we wouldn't be targeting going beyond what we were pre-pandemic, but just returning to those levels that we had. And for our categories, that still means the vast majority of our sales are done off the shelf with no price reduction. Most of this is good quality merchandising, targeting the consumer around key price points, et cetera. So we think those in combination are the right level of spend given the consumer dynamics, given what we see from a return perspective and what we think is needed to grow categories and to grow share over the long term. Anna Lizzul : Great. Very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. So I just wanted to touch on the fiscal \u201824 guidance. You're assuming gross margins come in well below the fiscal Q4 level and the level in the back half of the year. I know you've got $200 million of higher costs you mentioned in prepared remarks. First, can you just give us some more detail specifically on that bucket and what's driving cost increases? And then, b, just as you think about it conceptually, the lack of sequential progress versus the back half of the year, obviously, it's up year-over-year for the full year. Just wondering how that fits in with your goal to eventually move back towards those pre-COVID gross margin levels and why not more progress this year, again, specifically relative to that back half. Thanks. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. Happy to take those questions, Dara. Maybe let me start with cost inflation and what we're projecting for this year. Maybe if I step back and just think a little longer term in terms of what we've been dealing with and you folks know fiscal year \u201922, a really difficult year given that extreme levels of cost inflation, about $800 million. Last year, we experienced about $400 million of cost inflation. And this year, we're projecting about $200 million. So sequentially getting better, it's moderating, but we're still expecting to operate in a higher cost environment. As we look at that $200 million worth of supply chain inflation, there's really two areas we're predominantly seeing those cost increases coming through. I would say about a third of that we're projecting will hit in commodities. There's a number of items we still see inflating, particularly chemicals, substrate, corrugate and linerboard, we're still looking at rising costs year-over-year. Resin for us, we're looking as a fairly neutral cost. It came down last year, and we're assuming it'd be relatively flat this year. And then we are seeing some cost declines in some of our ag products and diesel. But overall, we think that bucket will be modestly inflationary. And then the other item we're looking at really hits particularly manufacturing and warehousing primarily driven by labor that we continue to expect to be operating inflationary environment. And so those are the primary buckets where we expect to see the $200 million. Now on the gross margin goals this year and the phasing of those -- as you said, Dara, we're expecting to continue to make progress rebuilding gross margin. And you folks know we've talked about this quite a bit, we're committed getting back to those pre-pandemic levels of margin. I think we made good progress last year. We\u2019ve improved about 360 basis points. We expect to build on this this year, expecting another 150 basis points to 175 basis points of improvement. And so by the end of this year, assuming we deliver this plan, we will have recovered a little over 500 basis points of that 800 basis points we lost. Now in terms of the phasing, I'd say, Dara, typically Clorox has some seasonality in terms of our margins. Typically, our fourth quarter is our highest margin. And that's particularly because we do an -- a disproportionate amount of our Kingsford business in the fourth quarter. I think as you folks know, we sold out 50% at Kingsford in the fourth quarter. It's a very business. So that tends to generate our highest margin. And then typically, Q2 is our lowest margin point. One, because we do very little Kingsford as well as we do some, a lot of gift packing on our Burt's business, which is a great activity to drive awareness and trial, but it comes at a lower margin. So you should normally think about our business. Once we've gotten past the normalization and the pricing and all the disruptions, historically, Q2 is a low point and then Q4s are high. So I think it's better to look on a year-over-year basis versus sequentially quarter by quarter. Now in Q1, I expect we'll make good solid progress. Now, not to the same degree in Q4, 560 basis points because we've now lapped that third round of pricing starting now. And so you should expect it to step down the benefit of pricing, but I expect to have a good solid Q1. And then what I expect to do is continue to advance margins on a year-over-year basis and as we said, we're targeting to get to about 41% this year. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. And are you assuming any incremental pricing next fiscal year? I'm assuming you're not. Is that more just a pause after all the pricing you've taken and maybe you can return later on? And then if I'm not overstaying my welcome, Linda, can you just comment on household penetration and your performance this fiscal year, particularly in light of the comments around the ROI on marketing being at an all-time high and the personalization reaching nearly a 100 million consumers? Thanks. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah, Dara, I can start with our pricing assumptions. In the outlook, we have not assumed any broad-based pricing in the US similar to the first four rounds we've taken. Now, we will continue to price internationally because of the higher inflation rates we're experiencing there. And we'll also continue to focus on net revenue management activities. But in terms of broad-based pricing, we don't have anything assumed in the US this year. Linda Rendle : And then your question on household penetration, when we talked about this a bit over the last few quarters, household penetration, along with volume, were things we knew were going to take a hit we took the level of pricing we have over the last 18 months. And we've certainly seen that. And this is a category comment, not just a Clorox brand comment, but what we tend to see is people having short-term reactions from a behavior perspective, and they adjust as they see the initial shock of pricing. And, certainly, they've seen four rounds they've had to adjust to. So typically what we see is we see consumers looking to go to alternates. Maybe they use the inventory they have in their home, they delay a purchase cycle, they look -- they engage in value seeking behavior. They trade up to larger sizes or smaller sizes. And in very extreme cases, they leave the category. And then from a household penetration perspective, a number of those factors play in. We've seen some light users exit the category, which isn't a big surprise. It's typically what we've seen during price increases. And I think importantly to note, again, this is a category behavior, not a Clorox brand behavior. And then what we're focused on, of course, is over time returning that household penetration. And I think it's important to put in perspective, we're still in nine out of 10 US households in our portfolio. But we want to be in a place where we're growing household penetration again. So what I would think about is all the investments that we spoke about a little earlier, increase in advertising and sales promotion, as well as our focus on innovation and category growth plans are all in service of returning to volume growth, returning to household penetration growth and then, of course, our aim over the long term to grow share. I mean we would expect household penetration to begin to improve as we get through pricing, and as we move through the course of the year and then through the course of our plan. But what I would say is, very in line with our expectation, and we feel good about the plans we have in place to continue to make progress on household penetration in fiscal year \u201824 and beyond. Operator : And our next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Please go ahead, Filippo. Filippo Falorni : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Just want to ask a question on gross margin again, following up to Dara's question. What drove the outperformance relative to your plan in Q4? It seemed like cost saving came in well ahead of expectation, and it was a record year for you guys, particularly in Q4. And, how much was the incremental volume leverage from the better -- from better volume trends? And then as you think about next year, how should we think about cost savings -- like, also, another year above, algorithm? Thank you. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. Thanks, Filippo, for the question. As it relates to Q4 and you're right, the over-delivery on gross margin versus our expectation. We went into the quarter targeting 40% to 41% gross margin. And as you saw, we delivered just under 43%. I would say for the most part, as you look at the various drivers within gross margin, they're generally in line with our expectation. That was certainly true for cost savings, pricing, and commodities. The biggest variance was our top-line performance and particularly on volume. And so volume only declined 2% for the quarter. We had projected a larger volume decline in the quarter. And as a result of that, had improved operating leverage, that really flowed through the entire P&L. It certainly benefited gross margin, but it also was the primary driver of our very strong earnings performance for the quarter. And then, as we go forward and on your question on cost savings, look, our team did some just terrific work this year. We target a 175 basis points of EBIT margin expansion each year through cost savings. In fiscal year \u201823, we delivered well north of 200 basis points. And that's really a credit to the team and the work they're doing to drive cost out of the system. And I fully expect to have a very strong year this year as well. So I would expect this year, we'll have another strong year that's probably north of 200 basis points. And that's incredibly important because as we said, we continue to operate in an inflationary environment. And for us to continue to grow margin, it's really based on the good work our team is doing both on driving cost savings and driving the supply chain optimization work we're doing. And that's allowing us to absorb that increased inflation and continue on our progress rebuilding margin. So really good work by the team and exceeded our goals both last year and I expect to do it again this year. Filippo Falorni : Great. That's super helpful, Kevin. And then a high-level question, Linda, just, in your guidance on top-line, you mentioned you expect a sequential improvement in volume throughout the year. Just what gives you guys the confidence of the volume coming back other than, obviously, the comparisons to like, at a high level, is it that incremental advertising investment or any other specific point that you can point to give us some confidence on the volume improvement? Thank you. Linda Rendle : Yeah. On volume, maybe just to take a step back, I think would be helpful and talk a little bit more similar to my comments on household penetration of what impacts volume and then what we believe we'll see over time as we return to more volume based growth from more pricing driven growth. So the big picture on this, we knew we were going to make a volume trade-off with the level of pricing that we took. And certainly that pricing was cost justified. And I think that's the right trade-off given the fact that we were able to deliver the top-line and margin progress that we committed to. And it's only one lever that we look at it, understanding brand and category health. So if we if we look at volume, again, what impacts it? Consumers are adjusting to pricing right now. And we still have two price increases that we will lap here in Q1 and Q2. And so they're still adjusting to what the pricing is. And they're adjusting to pricing well beyond our categories. I think it's also important to note there's an element of cross elasticity here. Everything in their world has changed from a wallet perspective. And they also just came through a pandemic and they want to have experiences. So we're watching that consumer settle out. And what we're seeing in our data is volumes are beginning to improve. You saw that if you look to 52 weeks, our volumes were down more than they were in the latest 13 weeks, for example, so we are making improvement. We still have to lap those two price increases. But from a consumer behavior standpoint, what you'll see is consumers will return to their old routines because those routines were the most efficient and effective for them, and particularly in essential categories, they don't want to have to work harder to do this stuff. So perhaps they've run through the inventory they have in their house, maybe they tried an alternative and it doesn't work as well, and we tend to see those people start to come back. We also saw light users category loss tend to come back again because we reintroduce our products to them through innovation. We use our advertising spend to talk to them about the benefits of the product, we remind them that, and they pick us up again as they send their child back to school or if their family experiences a run of cold and flu in the house. So those moments, we tend to bring those light users over, and volumes tends to grow again. And we've seen that every time we've taken pricing, and that's consistent in categories. I think what's unique for this time is, the amount of inflation our industry and Clorox experienced specifically is unprecedented. We\u2019re certainly not taking this level of pricing. So it really will be about the pace that this happens at. But we're happy with the progress we've made so far. We think we have the right plans in place. We're making the right investments. Our brands are still a superior value versus what they were pre-pandemic, so they're very strong. And we believe over time, again, we will make progress on volumes and return to more volume-based growth moving forward. Filippo Falorni : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : And our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JP Morgan. Please go ahead, Andrea. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good afternoon. Hello, everyone. My question is on the shipments and consumption trade-off, if there's any trade off. You mentioned volumes came in better than anticipated, Linda, and was driven by -- was it driven by consumption, or do you think retailers were also rebuilding inventory, given that consumption was better than feared? As you exit the quarter, do you feel inventory levels are where they should be? And then related to that, I also have a clarification on the assumption for the mild recession for the second half and your comments about, like, volumes coming in slightly better than anticipated. So -- but on top of that, you said category behavior has been changing. Is that some more price elasticity that you saw towards the back end of the quarter or your exit rate on the quarter, or you are just assuming prudently that at some point, you're going to see the historical price elasticities you want to kick in? Kevin Jacobsen : Hey, Andrea. Let me maybe start with your shipment consumption question and then Linda can address price elasticity. As it relates to the fourth quarter, I think there's a few things we are seeing, and I'll talk both versus our expectations and on a year-over-year basis. Versus our expectations, as you know, we had anticipated about 3% to 6% organic sales growth, and we delivered much stronger growth in the quarter. That was primarily driven by consumption coming in stronger than we anticipated. So the consumer is still quite resilient and we haven't seen any drop-off in consumption as we look Q4 to Q3 and we expect that we might see some drop-off in consumption, and that didn't materialize. And then the other driver of our performance was Kingsford. And as you know, we talked quite a bit about that last quarter. We were disappointed with the results in the third quarter. We made some changes to our plans. And I would tell you, we're a bit cautious on what exactly we'd be able to accomplish in the fourth quarter. But credit to our team, we had very strong execution. That business grew both volume and double digit in sales, had a very strong performance. And that was the primary drivers to the over delivery. The other element to think about though as it relates to inventory, we think retailers generally have the right inventory levels. But one of the reasons we had very strong growth on a year-over-year basis is, if you think about last year, retailers were reducing inventory levels. And at the time, as we were all getting more comfortable with the resiliency of the supply chain, everyone was starting to take down their safety stocks. And we saw that last year with retailers reducing inventory. And if you think about what's really happening when they do that, what that means is retailers continue to sell to their customers, but they don't reorder from the manufacturers. So they're still selling product and not reordering from us. And so last year, our shipments lagged consumption. This year, as you fast forward, we saw our shipments much closer to consumption because retailers are not adjusting inventory levels. So on a year-over-year basis, that drove much stronger performance. That was particularly true in our home care business where we saw inventory reductions a year ago. We saw, and particularly in wipes, we saw very strong wipes shipments this Q4, which is really now we're shipping in line with consumption, which was not the case a year ago. And that really contributed to very strong year-over-year performance and that 14% growth. And then, Linda, I know she can speak to elasticities. Linda Rendle : So on elasticity, what we saw in Q4 specifically was continued in aggregate, lower elasticities than pre-pandemic and lower than we had expected. Again, this is nuanced by categories or some categories that are less favorable, et cetera. But in aggregate, our elasticities were more favorable than we expected. What we expect to happen in fiscal year \u201924 is over time those elasticities return to more normalized levels. And it's not anything related to particularly our categories, but just the broader pressure the consumer is under. So if you look at what's going on, certainly balance sheets for them are returning to pre-pandemic levels, particularly savings rates where the consumer had a lot of excess savings over the last few years. Right now, we are anticipating a mild recession in the back half. We think that's the most prudent plan based on what we're seeing for economic predictions in the US. That will put additional pressure on the consumer as well. And we think those factors in combination will lead to more normalized price elasticities, and that's what we have assumed in the plan. Andrea Teixeira : That's helpful. And on the -- just a clarification, the impact of the inventory write-down -- not write-down, but inventory rationalization last year, was it like a low single digit headwind that then disappeared this year or normalized? Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. Andrea, you're exactly right. Last year, we anticipated there was a couple point headwind as a result of the inventory reductions at retailers. And so we didn't have that impact this year. So year-over-year, that's a source of benefit and part of the 14% organic sales growth we delivered this year, part of that was driven by lapping that inventory reduction in the prior period. Andrea Teixeira : Super helpful. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Operator : And our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Chris. Chris Carey : Hey, everyone. Kevin Jacobsen : Hi, Chris. Chris Carey : Just one quick follow-up on the gross margin assumptions. Kevin, you said in the prepared remarks that commodities would still be a bit inflationary. What are those commodities? I know there's always a lag, but I would just be curious where you're seeing that just given the favorability that we can see on this side? Then I have a quick follow-up. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. Chris, as it relates to commodities, and within that $200 million, we said about a third of that we see is coming from commodity inflation. So that'd be roughly, $60 million or so. I would say there's a few areas. We're seeing substrate, some chemicals, and some corrugate linerboard inflating year-over-year. Now that's partially being offset in a number of areas where we are expecting some deflation, particularly in ag products, soybean oil. We also expect diesel down year-over-year. And resin, we've got about flat on a year-over-year basis, so it's not necessarily contributing or helping. But that's really what we're seeing in terms of our commodity basket and it's modestly inflationary, certainly an improvement from where we were last year, but still modestly inflationary is what we're projecting. Chris Carey : Okay. And then just on the organic sales over-delivery, non-tracked charcoal comping, some under shipment in the base, and then stronger consumption, just to make sure I have those. Anything else\u2026 Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. Chris Carey : \u2026coming up a lot this evening. Okay. All right. Thanks. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. Those are two primary drivers. Chris Carey : Okay. Great. Just like a strategic question, Linda, it's interesting how far this whole spectrum on investment has come that, this evening, it's almost like, are you spending enough? And you're talking about higher advertising spending, really strong S&A. And I guess maybe it'd be helpful because, we're getting through earning season now. What's your take on why we're seeing this really significant step-up in investment levels? And it's not just from Clorox. It's from all of your peers, marketing spending, SG&A are just going to levels that have not been seen in a very long time? Is this just a lot of manufacturers saying we need to get volumes going, are you feeling a lot more push from the retailers to get volumes going? Just, what are your thoughts on maybe why this investment cycle is coming together and some of the key drivers and see where it\u2019s going. So just -- I know it's a big question, but thanks for any thoughts. Linda Rendle : Sure, Chris. Yeah. I won't speak on behalf of the industry, I\u2019ll certainly let everyone speak on their own behalf. But I can just give you the insights into how we're thinking about it. And I think it's a pretty clear understanding. We -- headed into COVID, we had learned a lot about volatility and the impact that it had on our business. And so we began investing more a number of years ago to ensure that we had the right digital foundation, that we had the right organization suited to a more volatile environment, that we have the right capabilities to ensure that we continue to lead from a consumer insights perspective and that the data we have flows as fast as we possibly can get it, so that we can make quick decisions. So that was certainly an area for us where we needed to invest within our digital transformation and our operating model to ensure we could react as fast as consumers could be. We want to be more consumer obsessed, faster, and leaner. And then if you look at the bucket on promotional spending, I look at that as more of a return to the norm. And for us, that spending is on good things. We spend mostly on quality merchandising. We do that to introduce consumers to innovation. We do that to remind them in keep pulse points of the year, like back to school, back to college, remind them the great products that we have, introduce them to new benefits, et cetera. And so seeing that return to more pre-pandemic levels, I think, makes good sense given the industry can fully supply now. We can certainly supply now. And so we get back into that good cadence of giving the right information to shoppers. And then on A&SP, which we have decided to take up, as you know, from 10% to 11%, and, and we addressed earlier, I think this is another case where the number one thing that we can do right now is ensure that we have superior value for our consumers. And we have that from a ratings perspective. Over the last couple of years, we reached the highest brand superiority overall from a portfolio perspective we've ever had. We continue to have more of our portfolio of superior than we did pre-pandemic. And we think given the stress that consumer is going to be under, it would make absolute sense given the improvement we've made on margin to invest a bit more in advertising and sales promotion to secure that with consumers. And that's how we're thinking about it. We have great brands, great innovation, great products, and we want them at this time when they're making those choices in their total basket of spending to remind them in our household essential categories no one delivers a better value than Clorox. And that's exactly what we're focused on. So to me, I think it is it's exactly what we do. We focus on the long term. We focus on building brands. And the spending is right in line with doing that. Chris Carey : Thank you, both. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Chris. Operator : And our next question comes from Javier Escalante from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, Javier. Javier Escalante : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I am -- I have another permutation of the same, observed retail sales in tracked channels versus the over-deliver in the quarter, but hopefully it's from a different angle. So if you can talk about all channel retail sales growth, if you give us a sense of what were Clorox's Q4 retail sales, including online and Home Depot and things like that, so we can better understand your guidance going into fiscal \u201924? So if we can start with that and I have a follow-up. Kevin Jacobsen : Javier, let me let me see if this helps. If you look at our Q4 performance and I think your question is sales across many different channels. As you saw, very strong growth, if you look at tracked channels, that's true. But what I'd also tell you is some of the areas that are not showing up in tracked channels, we had very strong performance. Our PPD business grew both volume and sales in the quarter. In international, we held volumes and grew sales 14% organically. And then our non-track sales were even stronger than track. So, we're seeing broad performance, not only in tracked channels, but we're seeing it in all the areas where we're selling product. And that contributed to the overall performance of the business. And that's why you'll probably see even stronger results on what you're seeing if you're just looking at tracked channel performance. Javier Escalante : Well, the reason I'm asking that is because, I think Linda mentioned that consumption was stronger, right, and this is part of the over-deliver in the quarter, but we don't see that in track channels. We see retail sales growth at 6%, both in the March the June quarter and then there is this very big difference in organic sales, and particularly on the volume side. So wondering if you could at least -- let me tackle differently. What is -- what percentage of your sales is in non-tracked channels, specifically in this quarter, given the seasonality of Kingsford? That would be helpful. Linda Rendle : Javier, maybe it would be good just to back up again and go through to make sure we go through all the drivers of what drove track consumption versus organic sales, and Kevin just covered part of it. But we do have a fair amount of our sales in non-track channels. It's a little complicated because non-track does not include international PPD, which is why Kevin broke it out the way he did. So, just to break it down, we had Q4 organic sales growth of 14% and we saw track sales consumption of about 7%. So the delta would be what Kevin highlighted. International and PPD are portion of that. PPD grew volume, international held volume. Remember that we're lapping wipes inventory that Kevin spoke about, and that's a portion of it. And then we saw stronger, non-tracked performance in a number of retailers on a number of businesses. And that's across e-commerce and brick and mortar, et cetera. And then in addition to that, we did, we haven't spoken a lot about this yet, but we do always ship some of our Q1 events in Q4, and that contributed to that delta as well. But we do have a strong non-channel track channel presence. And so, yes, that absolutely can move the number. And this is pretty normal for us to have a quarter that is a bit disconnected from tracked channel sales, in addition that you have the fact that we have very strong merchandising in Q1 as we normally do, and we typically ship some of that in Q4. But those are really the -- if you look at those four buckets, those are the four buckets of the difference between the 14% and the 7%. Javier Escalante : Well, thank you. And if I squeeze in something when it comes to pricing for next year, how much is the carryover impact for fiscal -- in fiscal \u201824? Kevin Jacobsen : Javier, this one is pretty minimal. What we have left to lap is, the fourth round of pricing that we took for half a year. So if you look -- Javier Escalante : Okay. Kevin Jacobsen : This year, we had in total, about 670 basis points of total benefit for the year, you should expect a much smaller benefit in fiscal year \u201824 because now we're looking at just half a year on one of our pricing actions. And the fourth round was not as large as the third round. Javier Escalante : Okay. Thank you so much. Very helpful. Operator : And our next question comes from Olivia Tong from Raymond James. Please go ahead, Olivia. Olivia Tong : Great. Thanks. I just want to revisit gross margin because the pace of gross margin expansion in fiscal \u201824 versus the year just reported, obviously, a fair bit of deceleration. But I'm trying to understand, I mean, fiscal \u201823 recovery in gross margin was so meaningfully ahead of your expectations. Why is the pace of expansion slowing so much in fiscal \u201824? Because cost inflation, well, maybe not down, is certainly less of a pressure versus last year. Pricing is by and large working. The top-line is growing and gross margin is still quite a bit below pre-COVID levels, so would love a little bit more color on that. Thanks. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure, Olivia. As it relates to gross margin, as you said, we continue to expect to make progress this year. So our commitment is to rebuild gross margin back to pre-pandemic levels. This year, we're looking at about a 150 to a 175 basis points of progress. And that's slowing from what we delivered last year and is primarily driven by pricing. So we took four rounds of pricing over the last 18 months, and that had a significant benefit last year. It contributed over 650 bps to gross margin. As we look at fiscal year \u201824, as I was just mentioning to Javier, we have fairly limited pricing in the plan. We're going to get a little bit of carryover on that fourth price increase. So it'll have a smaller impact on gross margin. And then we're really able to grow margin based on all the very good work our team is doing on cost savings and supply chain optimization. So in spite of still dealing with about $200 million worth of cost inflation, we believe we can more than offset that through the good work we're doing within the supply chain and continue to grow gross margins. And so while we're making good progress, I'd expect that to continue as we move into fiscal year '25, I expect that progress to continue. The one thing we'll have to look at over time is, we bought these commodities for decades. They are cyclical. At some point, they'll turn deflationary. That's not our expectation this year. But certainly, when that occurs, that'll certainly accelerate the pace of recovery. It's just hard in this environment to predict exactly when that's going to occur. But we feel very good about our ability to rebuild margins back to those pre-pandemic levels, and we know that's going to take some time to get there. But I have to tell you, I feel very good about progress we're going to continue to make this year in spite of ongoing inflation we're dealing with. Linda Rendle : Olivia, I'll add just one point to that. Kevin underscored the $200 million, which is significantly better than what we had at $500 million in fiscal year '23. But I just want to underscore that's still three times the level of average we had before we got into this inflationary cycle on an average year of inflation. So I think the point that Kevin is making is really important to understand. This is still a very challenging environment with significant cost inflation, although certainly better than we experienced over the last two years. Olivia Tong : Got it. And then on the top-line, as you look towards rebuilding volume as the year progresses, can you talk a little bit about innovation and what role that plays, and in your view, what kind of impact does innovation have on this year versus last? Linda Rendle : Sure. Innovation continues to be the lifeblood of how we grow our brands over time. And we set out to deliver bigger, secure innovation platforms as part of our IGNITE strategy. And we've talked about the fact that we've been able to have more net contribution from innovation in our strategy period than we did in the prior strategy period. And we're going to continue to focus on accelerating that this year. We have innovation across our portfolio just as we did this year. So all of our major brands launched innovation in fiscal year '23. We would expect something similar in fiscal year '24. We're really focused on value and value superiority in that innovation. So we're looking at a combination of product improvements and new innovations, as well as good claims support. And of course, we'll support that innovation with that 11% of sales from an advertising and sales promotion perspective. But we think as we lap these price increases, as a consumer comes under more pressure, innovation will be as important as it ever has been. And certainly our retailers are looking for innovation to help them grow their categories to ensure that we're getting shoppers down the aisles, et cetera. So what I would say is it's a continuation of what we've done. Of course, we want to have additional progress as we can and think we have the right investments to ensure that that continues in fiscal year \u201824. Olivia Tong : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead, Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks so much. So just taking a look, [playing our loan model] (ph) and looking at kind of the dreaded multi-year stacks, and -- but looking at the two year stacks on volume and on price mix this quarter in particular, like, all your comments make frankly more and more sense on the things you were lapping and the contribution, for example, for charcoal, to price mix that the inverse probably, I guess, for wipes on health and wellness. I was curious as we look forward, any other periods, because the stacks are messy, that you think should be called out where there is a dynamic of retailers having reduced inventory in the prior year so that we should be particularly keen for differences in shipments versus what we're seeing in tracked channels, knowing there's always on track that we won't see. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah, Lauren, it has certainly been, as we said, bumpy. This is now -- this is -- not everyone understands, I think, the definition of bumpy, and that we have, lots of lots of et cetera. I would say we are at a pretty good period of normalization now where I don't see anything, that we look ahead and say there was significant inventory buildup or something that we have to lap that's very notable. You know, we've gone through the COVID waves lapping. Pricing would be the one thing I call we're still lapping pricing. And Kevin, I think, and I have been clear on that. But I think you can predict that based off of what we put out there. And of course, that comment is barring any other changes that we see. Any other shocks in the environment, I want to knock on a little bit of wood saying that. But I don't see anything material that we would be looking ahead and saying, there's a big lap ahead of us that we have to consider, pricing being the one exception. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Great. And then just in follow-up, I was curious if you could comment on kind of where you stand, I guess, in terms of shelf space or distribution and knowing that and we've talked about several times in the past pre-COVID, there was some, kind of lost shelf space. And now you've had -- as you pointed out in the release, really strong innovation agenda. So I guess, where do you stand on kind of shelf space? How are you thinking -- do you think there's opportunities to be growing shelf space with innovation in \u201824? Is that part of the outlook or not so much? Linda Rendle : Yeah. We made good progress as we returned to full supply and getting our total distributions point up. So we made good progress over the last, call it, 18 to 24 months across a number of our businesses. And you all remember that in many cases where, the current -- us and our competitors couldn't fully supply to a lot of third tier brands that had entered in, for the most part, that is cleaned up, and we've been able to gain distribution points as a result of that in aggregate. What we're focused on for fiscal year \u201824 is exactly what you said. We want to gain distribution on our innovation. We want to make sure that we have the right SKUs on the shelf, as we think about, the right pack for the consumer, given their value seeking. We think we've done most of that work, but we want to continue to make progress, and particularly ensure that we get our innovations on shelf as fast as we possibly can on both the physical and digital shelf, and that's what the team will be focused on. And that will contribute to \u201824. We expect the category growth plans and the plans we have with retailers and our execution of those plans to contribute. But we feel good about what we're walking into and what we have for both the front half and the back half. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Thanks so much. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Lauren. Operator : And our next question comes from Steven Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, Steven. Steven, is your line muted? Steven Powers : Sorry. Can you hear me? Operator : Yep. Can hear you now. Go ahead. Steven Powers : Okay. Great. Sorry about that. So following up on that conversation you were just having with Lauren, actually, so it sounds like, things are relatively normalized from a supply and inventory standpoint. So the guidance implies, shipping to consumption. I guess I I'm curious, if it also, you've guided to what you expect category growth rates to be, both from a value perspective and a volume perspective, or if you're embedding any bias of share gain or even some share sacrifice as you still continue rebuild the margins? Just how to think about your guide relative to category growth expectations? Linda Rendle : So we've certainly taken account of the foundation of any year that we plan. We look at what we expect the categories to contribute, and, our assumptions in both as we lap pricing and as we head into what we predict is a mild recession in the back half of our fiscal, assume category rates commensurate with that. And then by category, we're looking at our plans, comparing it to that and adjusting based off of if we see headwinds or tailwinds. We want to make progress over the long term on share. We've built that into these plans. We've built in the fact that we're spending additional advertising and sales promotion, that we have good innovation plans. And that lands us at the total outlook that we've provided. But they're very much grounded in the realities of the categories and what we expect. Steven Powers : Okay. So just to summarize that, on a net basis, it doesn't sound like you're -- it sounds like the top-line all you're making is essentially in line with category growth. If things go well, maybe top end will market share gain, if not, you're kind of in the zone. Is that fair? Linda Rendle : That's fair. Steven Powers : Okay. Thank you. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Steve. Operator : And our next question comes from Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, Jason. Jason English : Hey, folks. Good evening. Thank you for [indiscernible] me in, and congratulations on a strong finish to the year. I'm going to totally do it myself, by going back in time to a time where you guys used to give us a log of all your price increases and decreases. And the point there was, there was decreases back in, I think, 2009 and 2010, you had you had some decreases on Glad, on Litter, more recently in 2018, I think you rolled back the prices of Glad. Obviously, all that was accompanied by pretty substantial downdraft in commodities. So my question is, if we get to your point, Kevin, your other downdraft in commodities, because these commodities, to your point, are cyclical, would we expect or should we expect you to roll back some of these price increases that you put through one of the four in the last year or two? Or, in light of the investment you're making, are you trying to manage the business differently? So instead of give back that relief in the form of pricing, you spend it back into the ability of the P&L through lines like A&P and marketing? Linda Rendle : Hi, Jason. Thank you for your comment. And then on your question on price rollback, just to be completely clear, so we're all on the same page, we've rolled back one price increase in a category we no longer own from a truckload perspective after taking an increase. And the other ones that you're referring to, I think, rightfully on Glad, is we've always used trade as a way to evaluate given resin is such volatile commodity. And so as we've taken pricing, we've used trade in the past in order to make up a difference if we've seen favorability in resin that we needed to deal with or we saw something change in the category. But the pricing that we've taken has stuck in the marketplace. And given what we're facing right now, obviously, we have not fully recovered margins, made great progress through the pricing action we've taken, but we have additional work to do given the fact that we continue to see an inflationary environment, also we talked about three times the average year, certainly better than last year, but still a big headwind. We are planning to -- and anticipate the pricing increases will stick, and that will bring back volume and household penetration through innovation and through investment in advertising and sales promotion. But we don't see any structural reason why these price increases wouldn't stick like they have in the past. And again, we're really focused on ensuring we grow categories the right way through those other levers. And if we need to make an adjustment, I think Kingsford is a good example. We did not roll back pricing. So we took pricing. Competition did not follow. We made an adjustment to our plan by putting incremental merchant place. We did not rollback. Our truckload pricing, we continue to hold that, is a good example of how we're approaching it, that if we see a dynamic in a category we need to react to, we will try to do that in a short-term manner, and maintain the truckload pricing we've taken. Jason English : Okay. So that actually sounds like you do intend to manage pricing differently than you did a decade ago or so. Last time we came through a commodity super cycle where you didn't just adjust by trade, you actually announced those price increases, you published those price increases, you gave us a log for the list price decreases on the back end of it. And I'm hearing you say now that that's even if clients do come in, that's not the intent. The intent is to manage it differently with trade, flexing trade if we find ourselves in that scenario, and I totally appreciate that you don't see that scenario. That's not what you're calling for in 2024, given the commodity the overall inflation environment? Linda Rendle : Yeah. I see it as a continuation of what we've done in the past, Jason, seems like we have a little bit of different data. But, yes, I think we're getting to the same conclusion, which is we intend for these and price increases to stick. We think we have the right tools in place to do that. And we're focused on all the other levers we can pull to continue on the strong category performance we've had from a top-line perspective as I noted on spending and innovation. But we're -- you're landing on the same conclusion, which is we believe these price increases will stick and have a good structural reason to do that. Jason English : Understood. Thank you. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Jason. Operator : This now concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle, I would now like to turn the program back to you. Linda Rendle : Great. Thank you, everyone. We look forward to speaking with you again on our next call. And until then, please stay well. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Clorox Company First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. Lisah Burhan : Thank you, Jen. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On the call today with me are Linda Rendle, our CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. I hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. In just a moment, Linda will share a few opening comments, and then we'll take your questions. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, including about our fiscal 2024 outlook. These statements are based on management's current expectations but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements, which have been filed with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the non-GAAP financial information section of our earnings release and the supplemental financial schedules in the Investor Relations section of our website for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Now I'll turn it over to Linda. Linda Rendle : Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We entered fiscal year 2024 with momentum, supported by strong progress on our priorities over the past several quarters to maintain top line growth while rebuilding margins. Prior to the August cyber-attack, our performance was on track with our expectations with solid consumption and market share trends, including improving volume consumption as we lapped year ago pricing actions. This is a testament to the strength and superior value of our brands and the role they play in our consumers' daily lives. In addition, we continue to realize benefits from our margin-enhancing initiatives, including pricing, cost savings and supply chain optimization. However, the cyber-attack caused wide-scale operational disruptions, which adversely impacted our first quarter financial performance. While we're not yet back to normal, we are now on a solid path to operational recovery, but this will take some time. We're laser-focused on our immediate priorities of rebuilding retailer inventories as quickly as possible, preserving merchandising activity and improving our distribution to return to the trajectory we were on prior to the cyber-attack. We've proven that we can execute and rebuild inventories, earn back our shelf space and distribution and regain and ultimately drive share growth over time, just as we did coming out of the pandemic, when we restored supply following extraordinary demand for our products. We're confident in our ability to do so again, given the strength and superior value of our brands, the relevance of our IGNITE strategy and the relentless focus of our teams on executing with excellence to win in the marketplace. As we navigate the near term, we remain committed to our long-term strategies for growing the top line and rebuilding margins, which includes investing in innovation and brand building, driving our hallmark cost savings program and advancing our digital transformation and streamlined operating model. Looking ahead, the disruption of the last few months does not change The Clorox story. As we execute on our recovery efforts, we're confident that our portfolio of leading brands in essential categories and our IGNITE strategy will enable us to regain market share and deliver consistent profitable growth over time. With that, Kevin and I will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Peter Grom with UBS. Peter Grom : So Kevin, I was hoping to just get some color on the phasing implied in the guidance in the context of the 1Q performance in some of the 2Q commentary. Maybe just to start with gross margin up nicely in 1Q. Can you maybe walk us through the drivers that actually would push gross margin to be flat for the year? And then I know from a sales perspective, it's still a wide range, but it does seem to imply a decline in the back half of the year. Is that just some conservatism? Or are there key reasons behind that? Kevin Jacobsen : Let me start with gross margin phasing and talk about what we're seeing in Q1 and sort of how we see that playing out as we go forward. The 1 thing to keep in mind is -- and these assumptions really have not changed since we talked last quarter in August, which is, as it relates to pricing, as you may know, we took 4 rounds of pricing. We've now lapped 3 rounds of pricing. So you're going to start to see the benefit of pricing continue to moderate as we move throughout the fiscal year, and we'll lap the fourth round by the end of this quarter. And so as we get into the back half of the year, we'll no longer have the benefit of pricing. Now we're still taking pricing internationally. So there'll be some benefit, but not to the degree you're seeing. And as an example, if you look at our most recent quarter, pricing benefit to margin is worth about 470 basis points. So a nice contributor and you'll see that moderate as we go through the year. And then the other item I would highlight is, we're going to see our belief is increased merchandising levels. And again, this is not a change in our assumptions. We continue to operate below pre-pandemic levels. Typically, we merchandise about 25%, 27% of our business. And last year, we ended up about 20%. And so we continue to expect that to increase as we go forward. And so our assumption is in the back half of the year that we'll see increased levels of merchandising support that will put a low pressure on margin. And then lastly, we continue to believe that we're going to see a consumer that's under more pressure in the back half of the year. And for all the reasons you folks know is we talk about a return to paying student loan, payments, increasing interest rates and the pressure that will put on consumers. And typically, that puts a little bit of pressure on our categories. Now based on the nature of our categories being everyday essential categories, it's not a significant impact. But usually, you could see consumption down 1 or 2 points as a result of that. And that's an assumption we've continued to assume since the beginning of the year, and that will pressure margins a little bit as well. Now on the sales, talk a little bit about the back half. Obviously, you folks saw we were down 20% in Q1. And if we deliver our expectation for Q2, which is sales to grow mid-single digits, that would project in the back half of the year on a reported basis, sales being flat to down high single digits. And that's a fairly wide range. I think it's a function of both the macroeconomic uncertainty about how this plays out with the consumer. But then the additional variability we have is we're working to rebuild some of the distribution and share we've lost, we fully expect to rebuild that, but we recognize there will be some variability in the exact pace of that recovery and it's not totally in our control. And so that will have some impact on our sales performance as well. But I think, Peter, what's most important is, Linda and I are quite confident we will rebuild back that distribution share we lost as a result of cyber event. But trying to predict the exact pace of that recovery is a little difficult to do. And so we provide a range that we think reflects that variability. Peter Grom : And then maybe just a follow-up. I know this may be hard to answer as we're kind of only in the first quarter of this year. But do you have any perspective around whether you think the disruption could have some lasting impacts beyond this year? Maybe from a top line perspective, do you see any risk that there could be shelf-space losses or permanent share shifts, anything from a margin perspective. I guess what I'm really trying to understand is whether you think you can fully recapture the earnings loss from the incident as you think about fiscal '25. Linda Rendle : We're really confident there's no structural issues related to this incident. It's short term in nature. And as Kevin highlighted, we have full confidence we'll be able to restore distribution and share over time. And what Kevin highlighted is exactly right. It's about pace. And what we're focused on this year is making progress as quickly as we can, and that starts in Q2 with rebuilding inventories. And we already are shipping well ahead of consumption now as we finished out the end of this month and we intend to continue to do that for the rest of the quarter with the goal of getting back to inventory in retailers as fast as we possibly can. We think we'll get through the bulk of that in Q2. We'll have some left to do in the back half of the year. And then, as Kevin said, rebuilding ensuring we have merchandising and distribution back to where it is. We are working as quickly as feasible to get as much of that done in '24 as we possibly can and that's what we're focused on. And we have a history of doing that. If you look back when, for example, Pine-Sol was out due to a product issue, we were able to get that distribution back quickly. If you look at post-COVID, the ramp-up on distribution was fast. And then we had a couple of quarters after that initial ramp-up where we continue to make progress. But what I can say is we intend to do as much of it as we possibly can in fiscal year '24. There's no structural issues related to this in our business. And we have strong confidence that given the superior value of our brands, our investments, and innovation that we will get it back. And again, as Kevin said, it's a matter of timing. Operator : And our next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Filippo Falorni : Linda, maybe just can you give us a little more color on the conversation with key retailers as you go and try to rebuild the shelf space. Is there a requirement of increasing merchandising? It seemed like part of your gross margin outlook as well. Just any color on how those conversations have been going so far. Linda Rendle : Yes. Thank you for the question and for the opportunity to once again thank my retailer partners for everything they have done during this time, they have been tremendous. And that is without exception, they have all gone above and beyond to ensure that we're getting as much product as possible to their shoppers. They partnered with us on manual operations, which is not easy for anyone to do. It wasn't easy for us and certainly not easy for retailers. They've been tremendous, and they continue to be tremendous. And now our focus is shifting from manual operations to rebuilding that inventory and they have the same goal of building it as quickly as we do, and they are taking every measure on their side to ensure that we have the right appointments et cetera, to do that. And it's a busy season for them with holidays, et cetera, and they're still prioritizing that. And then, of course, our joint focus is on ensuring that we get merchandising for things like cold and flu. We have Burt's holiday merchandising. We're focused and they are focused on ensuring that we meet those deadlines and that we get those in front of consumers and shoppers at that time. And then ultimately, what our goal is, and this is really important to retailers, too. Just like coming out of COVID, we had stronger relationships with our retailer partners than we did going in, and they were strong to start. We very much intend to make this a moment to be even stronger with our retailers through transparency, through partnering, through ensuring that we're doing everything feasible to get them what they need. So I feel great about where we are. And again, my thank you to them for everything that they're doing. And we are well on our path to restore where we need to be from an inventory perspective, and then we'll get the hard work back of ensuring we have innovation and great plans with their shoppers, so we can continue to get focused on growing categories once we get past this initial recovery. Filippo Falorni : Got it. That's helpful. And then, Kevin, maybe a follow-up on your gross margin question. Your commodity impact in the quarter and the gross margin bridge was 1 of the lowest in a very long time. So like can you give us a sense of whether your expectation on the commodity front for the balance of the year and maybe some help with the phasing. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. Happy to, Filippo. We came into the year with an expectation we have about $200 million worth of supply chain inflation. Now that's broader than just commodities. That's inflation across the entire supply chain. And that is still an inflationary environment, but certainly moderating versus what we've seen over the last few years. As you look at that $200 million, about 1/3 of that we anticipate is commodity cost inflation, about 2/3 is in other areas of supply chain, primarily driven by wage inflation that shows up in a lot of different areas. As it relates to commodities, we still expect to see commodity cost inflation this year. It has evolved a little bit. We've seen some areas coming in lower than originally anticipated. Chemicals being 1 of those areas, substrate as well. But then there are other items that we are seeing increases and primarily petroleum-based products. So some diesel solvents and even some of the ag products are a little higher, but mostly puts and takes. And so we still expect about $200 million worth of total supply chain inflation and that includes commodities. And in terms of phasing, it's pretty consistent through the year. I would think a little bit of increase in the back half of the year, to your point, is fairly modest in Q1, about 20 basis points. And so you'll see a little bit of that back loaded. But again, it's fairly modest relative to what we've been dealing with for the last several years. Operator : And we'll hear next from Anna Lizzul with Bank of America. Anna Lizzul : I just wanted to ask on regaining distribution. How much of the distribution recovery will need to be driven by innovation and do you already have this innovation in the pipeline? Anything in particular you had in the plan for fiscal '24? Linda Rendle : Thanks for the question. So the first priority, of course, will be restoring the distribution of the everyday items we have on the shelf that performed really well from a retailer perspective and consumer perspective. So we want to make sure that we get those back on and because we're very choiceful in how we work with retailers on the distribution and shelving that we have, the items that we have on the shelf deserve to be on there, and we're going to work to get those back on. But your point on innovation is exactly right. How we continue to delight consumers and shoppers and drive growth in the category is on innovation. And we had a team of people that we walled off as we were dealing with the initial impacts of this cyber-attack to ensure that we were able to ship the innovation that we have in the back half. And we're happy to report that innovation in the back half will go with plans. And all of our major brands will continue to have innovation that ships at that time, and we're working with retailers to ensure we get that on shelf as quickly as possible and that we get that in front of their shoppers. So we feel very confident about the base distribution that we will rebuild back as well as the strong innovation plans we have on all major brands in the back half and getting that on shelf with retailers. Anna Lizzul : And I wanted to ask around advertising and sales promotional spend. You mentioned it will be about 11% of sales. Is this enough given the disruption and potential loss in market share versus a similar percentage of sales that peers are spending on advertising and promotion. Linda Rendle : Yes. As you know, we'll continue to spend about 11% of sales on advertising and sales promotion, which was up versus last year where we spent about 10%. And we continue to believe this is the right level of spending to support the brands as we get through this inventory recovery and growth phase as we head into the back half. And of course, we'll make any adjustments that we see necessary by brand, et cetera. And it's also supported, I would note, by continued very strong performance from an ROI perspective. So we're getting more and more for that spend. So not only are we spending at a higher rates but we're also getting more for every dollar that we invest. And we'll continue to monitor that closely. But between that and the increased promotional environment we expect to see, we think we have the right money in the market to ensure that retailers have the right plans and the consumers are seeing our brands from a marketing perspective. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : I just want to follow up on that -- the gross margin conversation you had an answer to the first question. Because 1 spot where I was a little bit confused is, Kevin, you talked about pricing and merchandising dynamics, most notably for the second half and discussed them as being the same as prior assumptions and most notably to me on the merchandising side. But I'm not -- I feel like there's a disconnect because the prior gross margin pre-cyber, which you know is like a different time and world. I don't think it would have supported the idea of gross margins kind of flattish or flat to down in the back half. So I feel like there's a piece maybe missing outside -- I think you mentioned logistics costs for 2Q. But it does really something else is pressure in gross margins in the second half. So I just wanted to follow up on that point first. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, I'd say there's a few items. So you're exactly right. We've always assumed increased merchandising support. That was true back in August and that continues to be the case. The 1 other area, though, that we should talk about is as we're working to rebuild distribution and we're working to rebuild share, we are expecting lower sales in the back half than we were anticipating back in August. So lower sales will have some lower volume deleveraging that will impact margin. And then the other assumptions are generally similar to what we thought back 3 months ago. Lauren Lieberman : And then pricing, I guess, just to follow on also because if we're assuming that higher merchandising in the second half, that means I'm guessing that price promotion should be a headwind to sales in the back half. Is that right? Kevin Jacobsen : Well, I'd say merchandising levels overall will be as part of price mix, you'll see that show up. Lauren Lieberman : So yes, I was just struggling with the shipments, right? So that if shipments this quarter roughly right are down the high 20%, call 30% for rounding sake. Having your net sales only up in the mid- to high single digits in 2Q and saying you're shipping above consumption, it just feels like shipments sprinkle should be higher than that, right? I feel like the thing we're shipping above consumption is almost like a circular logic because Nielsen is informed by what's on the shelf, not necessarily consumer demand. Kevin Jacobsen : So I can certainly talk about Q2 and our expectation as you mentioned, we're projecting mid-single-digit organic sales growth in Q2. And you're exactly right. We expect, as a result of shipping above consumption, that's certainly going to help the top line relative to Q1. There's 2 items that will partially offset that. The first is we're going to continue to lap the benefit of pricing. And so you'll see that offering a smaller benefit in Q2 sequentially versus Q1. So if you saw in Q1, we had about 8 points of favorable price mix. The quarter before that, we had 16 points. So you'll continue to see that step down in Q2, and that will be a smaller benefit. And then the other item is, we are still in a position, particularly in October, we were losing consumption. We were losing sales. While we are shipping above consumption, we have not rebuilt retailer inventory levels yet. We still have auto stocks occurring. And so we are still losing sales, particularly in the month of October, probably bleed a bit into November as well. And so that's still providing a drag on sales in Q1 as well. So when you look at all that together, we think we will have that mid-single-digit growth as a result. Linda Rendle : Lauren, I'll add just 1 thing, which is a nuance to your point on shipping above consumption. When we say consumption, we mean what average consumption would have been being fully in inventory. So we're shipping well beyond that level, and that's how we rebuild inventories over time. So it is a meaningful overshipment versus what we normally would. Lauren Lieberman : Perfect. That definitely helps a lot. And then just the other thing is that it feels like, as I'm trying to piece through the model that selling in admin dollars, and I'm looking at everything versus my like model as of August 3. That you're actually able to take a good amount of cost out of selling and admin. And I was curious, and I'm just looking at straight dollars, not percentage of sales. I'm just curious how much of that you say is related to the operating model changes that were already [ implied ]? Is it -- some of this is maybe more variable, or has there been some belt tightening that goes with this, given the unfortunate cyber situation. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, Lauren, this is primarily the nice work we've done on the streamlined operating model work we're doing. As you know, we're targeting to eliminate about $100 million in cost. And I'd say, keep in mind, while we talk quite a bit about the admin savings, this is really about making us a more competitive company by accelerating decision-making and getting decision-making closer to people know their consumer best. But it does generate nice savings for us, and we are very much on track by the end of this year to complete that 2-year program to generate about $100 million in reduced admin savings. And so we started that last year, and you should see us continue to drive admin savings this year as well as we complete the program. But even in absolute dollars, you're seeing the dollars start to go down year-over-year in spite of the increased costs we're incurring because of the cyber event. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, for sure. And why not raise advertising dollars? I would have thought you want to spend -- you'd want to spend more. I get the percent of sales math, but sales are down so much. So I would just would have thought like trying to stay in front of the consumer when, frankly, this year's earnings \"doesn't matter\" all that much because it's a rebuild. Why not flex the advertising higher in the second half once you're back in stock? Linda Rendle : Lauren, we had all of those debates to see and prioritize having the right level of spending. And that's exactly the exercise that we undertook. And we think what we have in combination with innovation, with the merchandising spend is the right level, if there's any change to that based off of what we see in the marketplace, we absolutely will make adjustments prioritizing the health of our brands and ensuring that we're in front of our consumer but we feel good about that 11%. It still is slightly higher than it was last year, if you just look at absolute dollars as well. And of course, we're driving our team to try to get as much efficiency impact as they possibly can on that spend as well. But we think it's the right level. And again, as we always do, we will prioritize that. And if there's any adjustment needed based off of the path forward as we rebuild, we will make that, but feel very confident where we are right now. Operator : And our next question will come from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Christopher Carey : So a couple of quick questions. Number one, are there specific categories where you feel like it will be more challenging to rebuild your shelf than others, should we be thinking about this on a total portfolio basis? Or are there nuances between your various businesses? Linda Rendle : Over the long term, Chris, no. We feel confident across all of our categories that we'll be able to rebuild distribution, return to merchandising and, of course, return to the shares that we were before and grow from there. In the short term, though, there are some nuances, and you'll see recovery faster in some businesses than others. And that has to do with the rate of turn from a consumer perspective. So some of our items turn incredibly quickly, and they're heavy and bulky. And so we saw inventories depleted faster in those categories, for example, and those will take a bit longer to restore. And then some of our other categories where the turns are slower. We've had better inventory positions up into this point and the rebuild will be faster. And then some of it has to do with the complexity. So for example, Burt's Bees was more significantly impacted because those orders are highly complex. And in a manual environment that took more touches for us to get Burt's shipments out. And so that's 1 we're focused on rebuilding as quickly as we can given that was more impacted than some of our other businesses. And that's exactly the work we're doing right now and prioritizing that with retailers so that we have Burt's holiday merchandising, cold and flu, and we restore inventories in the most critical items that we have. And we're prioritizing that by retailer, by part of the country, by merchandising events. But over the long term, we have full confidence across all of our categories that we'll be able to restore inventory and distribution. Christopher Carey : One quick follow-up. I think there are some questions around trying to understand if there's any incremental costs associated with this maybe over the medium term, whether there's a step-up in merchandising in the back half or any other costs on top of that. I guess what I'm hearing is there are not, right? So you don't feel the need to invest more into digital infrastructure to protect against such things, you don't feel like you need to accelerate merchandising spending in the back half of the year to perhaps manage the retailers to give you more shelf space. Am I reading that correctly? It's more you lost the shelf now you're going to come back on, but there's no kind of incremental cost that are going to take time to fade away? Linda Rendle : Sure, Chris. First, and clearly, we had incremental costs in Q1 associated with this as we dealt with the cyber-attack itself and the systems issues that we needed to overcome and build. So there was an incremental cost there. Second, on the marketplace piece, we felt like we put a plan in place that took into account what we thought was going to be a more challenging environment. And that plan works very well for us in this environment of rebuilding as well. So we think we have the right tools in place. We believe, again, we have the right level of advertising and sales promotion, promotional dollars invested in that -- on the recovery. I would note 1 of the things that we're looking at because we remain deeply committed to our strategic priorities over the long term, including our digital transformation but we are so laser-focused on the inventory rebuild. We have work to do to see how we sequence that out over the future. And if there are any implications or shifts in timing in that, but we're not prepared to talk about that in detail today. Just know that continues to be of the highest importance to our strategy. We're deeply committed to it, and we'll be working out what that means in terms of timing and any implications over the coming quarters. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : So I wanted to go back, sorry, the shipment consumption but tackle it in a different way. So you think that like if you think about units, right, the categories that you compete in, would you say a positive in volumes like in the low single digits, if you -- if my math is correct. And if that's the case, what you're saying is that, yes, the mid- to high single digit given pricing is phasing off a bit and building off. You're saying it might take not 1 quarter, it might take 1 or 2 quarters and some unfortunate like losses that you had in market share or the volume that, that consumer went and couldn't find your product, it's not that they are going to buy 2 of them when they got into the store, right? Those lost sales are the lost sales. So is that the way we should be thinking? And then related to that, in a way, a second part of the question is that, is there any way you can quantify, like, if there is any -- how you -- as you get back to shelf, are you getting back that consumer that may have experimented because they couldn't find your product and regaining that consumer back? And what are the tactics that you're using to regain that consumer? Linda Rendle : Sure. Let me -- I'll start with the first part of your question. So maybe if we step back and look at what happened over Q1 and what we anticipate is happening over Q2 and beyond. The big picture is that when this first happens and we move to manual operations, which meant there was a period of time we were shipping anything for a very short period of time. And then we began manual operations and we were shipping at a lower rate. We still had inventory in the system for a number of weeks that allow consumers to have no visibility to this whatsoever. They went to the shelf and they had, for the most part, a normal experience and they were buying Clorox products. And then over time, depending on the item and category and depending on the inventory that a retailer had and how much we could get to a particular category or a retailer in the manual operations, consumers began to see out-of-stocks. And there's a number of behaviors that happen when they experience that. One can be they delay their purchase. They don't find their Clorox product and they delay. The second thing is they really need the item in that category, and so they purchase a competitive product. And that varies across, again, different categories and depending on where consumer inventories were. What that led to, though, is if you look at kind of what we had in Q1, about half of that downside was more than half was the bleed down of customer inventories. And then the rest of that we look at is lost sales. And then as we're rebuilding that inventory back up, you still have lost sales in Q2 at the beginning because we are not fully back. And so that same dynamic happens with the consumer when they go to the shelf. And as we rebuild inventories, we would expect as people who have delayed that purchase cycle or, frankly, haven't even had a purchase cycle yet come back that they'll see our items and continue to buy. And those that have switched to a competitive product, we have strong confidence given the superior value and the trust people have in our brands that once we bring those items back, they will return to that. And of course, we'll support that with all of the things that we know how to do really well. Merchandising that reminds them of the benefits of our products at key pulse periods. It is why we are absolutely laser-focused on things like getting cold and flu merchandising, which we begin to ship later this month and ensuring that we have that and people that are looking for Clorox disinfecting products at that time, we want to make sure that we're not disappointing them. We will do that through innovation and giving them new and increased benefits and of course, speaking to them in our strong marketing communications, where we talk about the benefits of our product and the value they offer to consumers. And we have strong confidence based off of a number of things in the past, COVID being one, where there was unprecedented demand and we couldn't fully need it. And we were able to, as we restore supply, consumers came back to our items even though they didn't find us on shelf in previous shopping trips that they had. So we're going to employ all the regular tactics that we have under our tool back. We're laser-focused on doing that. And then as you think about that consumer coming back, if you look at past history, just like I said with COVID or for example, when we were out of the market in Pine-Sol for a while, as we came back, those tactics worked very well to restore share, maybe Wipes, maybe the best example, we lost 20 share points during the time of the height of the pandemic due to inability to meet that extraordinary demand. And once we got our distribution back, which we did, we were able to regain that and then even more. People trusted our brand, and it's what they wanted. And so we have full confidence we'll be able to do that given the strength of our portfolio, the superior value of our brands and our continued focus on investments. What I would say is it's all about the pace. We can't completely control the pace of getting back in full distribution, but that's what we are absolutely laser-focused on. Our retailers have the same goal to get us fully back in and that's how we're really thinking about it. It is ensuring we get products back on the shelf, we get back to in market fundamentals and then, of course, doing everything we can to support consumers and what we think is going to be a tougher back half for them just as you look, as Kevin talked about from an economic perspective. Operator : Your next question will come from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Olivia Tong Cheang : As you think about sort of rebuilding inventory and market share, how do you ensure that this doesn't impact your ability to stay on pace on innovation and then eventually, your ability to get back to the gross margin recovery path because there's obviously -- you're not quite back there yet. You're still working on that. How is it that you can stay on patient innovation with all the disruption that's happened in the business and potentially some need to rejigger the marketing, promotional dollars, et cetera, in the second half of the year? Linda Rendle : Yes. Olivia, it comes back to what we've spoken about before and continues to be of critical importance to us. We are deeply committed to our strategy, and that includes continuing to drive our top line momentum while rebuilding margin and balancing the pace of those 2 things. And that continues to be the center of the focus as we make decisions recovering from the cyber-attack and all the choices that we'll have over the coming quarters to ensure that we're balancing that for consumers. So when this first happened, of course, job #1 was to ensure that we had contained the incident, we believe we have. Job #2 was to ensure that we could return operationally, which we did. And of course, we transitioned back to automated and now laser-focused on restoring supply. But at the same time, we knew it was critically important that we could not let go of the long term. And so I mentioned just a little bit earlier that we had taken a group of resources that did not need to be focused on the immediate issue at hand and we ask them to do everything in their power to preserve innovation in the back half. And that was while systems were down. And so they put together a set of plans to do that. And the good news is, we do have the ability to continue with our innovation plans in the back half because we did that. And what we believe is we just have to continue to balance those 2 things. We have to balance the short term and laser focus on restoring but we have to make sure that we have that innovation. And that's how we're approaching this internally. We are trying very hard to ensure that the resources focused on the short term are not distracted and the same with the resources on the long term. And if you recall, Olivia, we did this during COVID when the same issue occurred. Demand was so high. We had to ramp up supply. We were dealing with shortages on all of raw materials but we also did the same thing where we put resources aside for innovation to ensure that we preserve that long term. So that's what we're going to continue to do as we make choices moving forward is we want to balance short and long term. We want to balance top line momentum with rebuilding margin, and we have every confidence that we can do both of those based off of the plans that we've outlined for fiscal year '24 and beyond. Olivia Tong Cheang : Got it. And then just secondly, given the cyber-attacks, and I imagine you took another look at your capabilities and IT infrastructure, obviously in the middle of a program right now. Have you revisited the plan? Do you think there are more needs to be done? And if so, could that potentially extend the project further out? Linda Rendle : Yes. So 2 things. Prior to the cyber-attack, we had a number of particular cybersecurity measures in place, including endpoint detection and response tools across our enterprise. And as we experience this, we continue as we bring our systems online to enhance those and taking a series is to further strengthen our security controls. So that's 1 bucket. Second, of course, is we are in the middle of our digital transformation, as you note, and we continue to be deeply committed to that digital transformation. We think we have taken into account the broad set of tools and capabilities that we need to put in place to be more effective and efficient as part of that digital transformation. And we think more strongly than ever that is an important to our business and a critical priority to do that. What we are doing now is going through that program and ensuring any learnings we have over the last couple of months we're integrating into it. And then we're taking that into account as we bring the ERP online in the future and as we bring the rest of the tools in place. But what I would say at this point is, it's too early to say if there will be any tactical changes that we'll make and how we'll sequence and time that. But what I can reaffirm is our deep commitment to it, how critical we think it is to the company. And it is just more reaffirmed given what we've experienced over the last few months as we've restarted our systems. Operator : Your next question will come from Javier Escalante with Evercore ISI. Javier Escalante Manzo : I have a question, I guess, is a CFO question. And it has to do with the business planning, forecasting and reporting that you had. How often do you communicate with the segments reporting to you? Because this seems to be kind of like a very simple business, mostly U.S.-driven. And I was surprised by the fact that it took over a month to know that the incident was material. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, Javier. What I would say is, I think you saw we communicated in 1 of our previous 8-K that we thought this was going to have a material impact on our results. And so we try to communicate that fairly quickly. But then the next step for us was to determine the actual financial impact and so that's what we communicated in our preannouncement because we thought it was important, given the last outlook we had was what has put out there in August prior to the event. We did not want to wait until our earnings call today to report results. So as soon as we had a fairly good handle on the financial impact we communicated that publicly. Yes, you have to keep in mind the reality is we're working in an environment that had limited systems capabilities. So it was more manual effort. So that takes a little bit longer. But importantly, we thought we want to get out there and provide that information as soon as we could. But you have to really work through this, Javier, because what you're really trying to figure out is when you can restructure systems, when you can start rebuilding inventory. And depending on that time line, that will impact the financial performance. So you have to let this play out a bit as we're going through the evaluation of the cyber event itself, developing recovery plan and then determining the financial indications of that recovery plan. So that was all the work that went on. And then as a result of that, we came out with a pre-announcement about a month ago. Linda Rendle : Sorry, Javier, I was just going to build on Kevin's response to your question. The other thing I would just note is this is actually a fairly complex business. We compete in 13 categories in over 100 countries around the world. And we're aggregating all that information in a manual environment to understand the impacts. In addition to that, we are working with all of our retailers and supplier partners who then have to transition to a manual process with us and getting our arms around exactly the implications and timing. So I just wanted to note, it is actually a rather complex business and one where -- when we are in a manual environment, you could understand how difficult it would be to have full visibility to all parts of that. And as Kevin said, our commitment was to transparency and giving information as we had it, which you saw in those series of 8-Ks. Javier Escalante Manzo : I appreciate that. Now my question was, I used to work for 1 corporation, a large 1 global. And I remember that they used to close the books every month and we re-forecast every month. So basically, that was the question I was asking. So how frequent does the CFO office re-forecast the business plan on a regular basis, understanding that there was a cyber event, which is very unfortunate. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, Javier. Let me separate a normal environment versus the cyber environment because I was asked much different. So we -- similar to -- it sounds like the experience we close our books every month, we sell our results every month and we forecast on a regular basis. That's a cadence of anywhere from 5 to 8 forecasts a year. So we have very frequent updates in a normal environment. But as Linda mentioned, in this last period because of the limitation of automated systems, [ in vary ] manual environment. So it has less visibility to our financial performance while our systems were down. And then as we brought those systems back up, we actually communicated as soon as we had a handle on what we thought the financial impact was. Javier Escalante Manzo : And right now you have full visibility over your P&L, all the legal entities, all that. Kevin Jacobsen : We do. We've started up our systems, we're back to an automated environment that includes our ERP system. So yes, we have full visibility as we move forward now. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle, I would now like to turn the program back to you. Linda Rendle : Thank you, everyone. We look forward to speaking with you again on our next call. And until then, please stay well. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Clorox Company Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. Lisah Burhan : Thank you, Jen. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Linda Rendle, our Chair and CEO, and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. I hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. In just a moment, Linda will share a few opening comments and then we'll take your questions. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements including about our fiscal 2024 outlook. These statements are based on management's current expectations, but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements, which has been filed with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the non-GAAP financial information section of our earnings release and the supplemental financial schedules in the Investor Relations section of our website for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly-comparable GAAP measures. Now, I'll turn it over to Linda. Linda Rendle : Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We delivered financial results above our expectations in the second quarter, thanks to very strong progress on our recovery from the August cyberattack, continued advancement of our strategies to drive top-line growth and rebuild margin, as well as the swift and effective management of currency headwinds in Argentina. We are rebuilding retailer inventories ahead of schedule, enabling us to return to merchandising and restore distribution. As a result, we made great strides rebuilding market shares. Importantly, throughout our out-of-stock period and recovery, we've maintained our strong brand superiority results as measured by our consumer value metric. This speaks to the power of our advantaged portfolio, the superior value of our brands and their role in consumers' daily lives. While there is still more work to do, we're on the right path to return our business to the trajectory it was on before the cyberattack. Looking ahead, we expect the operating environment to remain challenging, as consumers remain under pressure and their value-seeking behaviors continue. Nevertheless, we remain committed to growing the top line and rebuilding margins and expect volume to play a stronger role in our top line performance as we lap pricing. We're well-positioned to make further progress in rebuilding distribution and market shares, as well as drive volume and household penetration growth over time through strong demand creation plans. Given the progress we've made in the second quarter, we are also updating our full year 2024 outlook. We have a strong diverse portfolio of trusted brands, we play in essential categories and we're making the right investments guided by our IGNITE strategy to create long-term value for stakeholders. I'm confident that we're taking the appropriate actions to build a stronger, more resilient Company that is positioned to win in the marketplace, and deliver consistent, profitable growth over time. With that, Kevin and I will take your questions. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Rendle. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan Chase. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good afternoon there . Linda and Kevin, I just wanted to go back, obviously, an amazing performance you caught up with I think with the second quarter fiscal you caught up with kind of according to my math a minus 2%, pretty much first half against first half of the prior year. And then what are you implying given the Argentine peso depreciation is underlying beta as you put in prepared remarks and your commented it just now but then you have a greater FX headwind. But when you go and flow through everything and according to the new guidance the plus 200 basis points improvement in gross margin. It implies that your gross margin in the back end declines vis-a-vis what you had in the back end of last year. And so I was just trying to reconcile, because your numbers kind of imply profitability going down, the way I understand the transactional FX. But it seems a bit high. If you can kind of walk us through why would that happen given the beats the magnitude of the beats? Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah, Andrea. And maybe let me take a stab at answering some of those questions, and let me know if we missed anything. But as it relates, maybe I'll just start with Argentina might be a good place to start. Because you've heard from many of our peers that's an incredibly difficult environment right now. I think if you just step back and think about our business in Argentina, we've been in there for a very long time, we have very capable leaders managing very strong brands. While there are some negative impact in Argentina flowing through our outlook we provided today, both on the top line in terms of higher FX as well as higher inflation and FX exposure and margin. What you should know is, based on the actions we've taken in Argentina, including incremental pricing, we think we fully cover the negative impacts of Argentina within this outlook with the one exception of the remeasurement loss and I'm happy to talk about that, but setting that remeasurement loss aside, we think we fully contain the Argentina impact in this P&L. As it relates to the back half, you were asking about gross margin, and as you saw, we delivered about 41.5% gross margin in the front half. And if you look at the back half, based on the outlook, it suggests will be fairly similar 41.5% as well. And so we're looking at sequentially fairly consistent trends. If I think about what's changing from the front half to the back half, there's a few items I'd point out. In terms of increased headwinds, we continue to expect higher trade spending in the back half of the year, as we get to a more normalized environment. We also now have lapped all our US pricing. We lapped the last round of pricing in December. So you'll see less benefit from pricing in the US. And then we're expecting more inflation and more FX headwinds coming out of Argentina. We are offsetting that with incremental pricing, we're executing in Argentina, so you'll see international price mix benefits in the back half of the year to a greater degree than the front half of the year, as well as we're projecting improving volumes trend. And so collectively that's offsetting those headwinds, and we're getting to a margin fairly consistent front half versus back half and that puts us in a position to improve margins by 200 basis points on a full year basis. Now, I think maybe the last question you talked about versus prior year, I think you have to be a little careful looking at the comps. If you look at our gross margins in the back half of last year, I think they're up almost 600 basis points. And so we're relatively flat, but on a very strong performance in the prior year. Well, let me stop there. Andrea, let me know if that answered your question. Andrea Teixeira : Yeah, that did Kevin. Thank you. And I think one of the kind of like a fine point on that commentary. When you say, in the prepared remarks, I think Linda had mentioned you're confident to regain shelf space and you're looking obviously regained service levels. It sounds to and even in our meeting recently in New York, you kind of alluded to initially that guidance and I think we all in this call appreciated there was a lot of moving pieces and you're conservative. It seems like you're embedding some potential risk at that point of not being able to recover the service levels, now you did recover. So I'm more in the side of like thinking of the strength of what you achieved in six months. I'm thinking more, why not expecting that momentum to continue now, that you potentially could recover some of the shelf space losses that you had, especially now coming up on the spring reset. Linda Rendle : Sure, I'll take that and maybe I'll just start with your first important point, which was our expectations in Q2, and what drove the significant over delivery. If you recall, you got it exactly right. At the point where we provided an outlook for Q2, we were at a point where we had just turned back to automated order processing and we knew there'd be a transition time going from manual to automated and that would take us a bit of time to ramp up. We're also heading into key holiday time for retailers, which is a challenging time to ensure that we get the ability to have appointments and ensure that we could deliver what we needed to, in order to deliver what we ended up doing for the quarter, which was every single day shipping significantly above an average day that we would normally ship. And we I think were appropriately cautious given all of those potential headwinds on what we could accomplish. And again, the goal was to restore inventories by the end, the majority by the end of Q2, knowing some of that would flow into Q3 and Q4. So what happened in Q2, we were able to get all of that ramp up and we really leaned into our operating model. We designated a General Manager, who is in-charge of solely getting inventories rebuilt and retailers. And she had a multi-functional team around her to do that. And we were able to quickly ramp up from manual to automated and ship nearly every single day significantly above an average shipping day pre-cyber event, and our retailers were extraordinary. So we were able to get in, we were able to get appointments and the result of that, if you look at distribution, we were down over 30% of our TDP. If you look at average weekly TDPs down over 30% at the height of our out-of-stocks. We've gotten back to mid-single-digits, some business is slightly better than that, some slightly worse, and I can cover that. Market shares at the height of this, we were down over five points. If you look at the four, five weeks ending December, we were down a point. Look at the latest four, five weeks ending January 21st down 0.7, so all that flowed in the right direction, which gives us confidence. But that speaks to with the work we have remaining and we talked about this last quarter. We spoke about the fact that a lot of this was under our control and we were going to maximize that I felt good about what we did in Q2. But we're also dealing with the fact that in order to fully restore distribution, we need to have retailer resets, and those happen mainly in the spring and they vary through the back half of our year. And we intend to finish the job, then. And in addition to that we have to fully restore merchandising. So as we get our business up to the service levels we expect, and to be clear, our service levels are still depressed. They are significantly better. But we need to fully restore those. We'll return to merchandising in the back half and full as well. And with that, we feel good about our plans, we feel like we have the right investment levels. Our brands have maintained their superior value as I said in my opening comments, so feel good about it. But I just want to be clear, we didn't -- the job not done in Q2, tremendous progress, but we have more work to do in the back half. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. I'll pass it on. Operator : And our next question will come from Peter Grom with UBS. Peter Grom : Thanks, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. So I wanted to ask on the organic revenue growth trajectory. Can you maybe just help us understand how you are thinking about volume versus price in the back half of the year. Linda, you mentioned you expect volume to be a stronger contributor to your performance, does that assume a return to growth or just kind of less of a drag versus what we've seen prior to the disruption. And then just on the pricing as well, particularly as you now lapped the US pricing but are taking incremental pricing related to Argentina. Thanks. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. Hi, Peter. As it relates to organic sales growth and transitioning from the front half to the back half, you have to think about what the changes are, as it relates to volume, we expect to see improving volume trends in the back half of the year. That's a combination of both continue to recover from a cyber-event as well as now that we've lapped pricing, we'd expect to see improving volume. If you look at the front half, our volume was down high single-digits and so we would certainly expect to see those improving volume trends as we go forward. And then in addition to price mix we've now as I said lapped our US pricing in December, the last of the four rounds we took. And so US will be contributing much less, in fact very little impact to favorable price mix. But we have now leaned into Argentina in November and December we took double-digit price increases both months. And so you will still continue to see positive price mix in the back half of the year in-spite of increased trade spending. So I'd say overall improving volume trends from the front half of the year. Price-mix being a little lower than the front half because we've lapped US pricing, but still fairly strong for us, and that's how we get to an expectation that we'll be growing for the full year low-single digits, and that means the back half would be a bit stronger than where we land in the front half in terms of organic sales growth. Peter Grom : Got it. And that's really helpful . And then I guess just, Kevin on the 42% exit rate, I think, I may be reading too much into this, but are you simply just trying to provide some color on the second half phasing, or are you trying to signal how we should be thinking about the gross margin recapture opportunity looking out to fiscal '25. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, it's more about phasing in the back half. Just want to make sure we're highlighting folks for that all that pricing in Argentina to take effect, it will probably be the fourth quarter or it's fully in market. So I'd I expect my fourth quarter gross margin to be a bit stronger than third quarter. But having said that, as you know, Peter, Linda and I remain committed to rebuilding gross margins back to the level we had before the, what I described as you know the super cycle of inflation. Good progress last year. We intend to make more progress this year, but the work is not done. And I fully expect going into '25, we'll continue to expand margins. But importantly we'll do that while we continue to invest to grow the top line and continue to advance our strategic initiatives. So we continue to focus on all three. But as it relates to margin I expect to make solid progress this year and I expect that to continue as we go into '25. Peter Grom : Thanks so much. I'll pass it on. Kevin Jacobsen : Thanks, Peter. Operator : And we'll move next to Anna Lizzul with Bank of America. Anna Lizzul : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for the question. I wanted to ask on the outlook in the prepared remarks, you mentioned expecting a modest slowdown in category growth rates in the back half of the fiscal year. Are there any particular categories where you expect an outsized impact versus categories that you think are more resilient. Linda Rendle : Sure. This assumption on a modest slowdown in categories is one consistent with what we provided as an original outlook to fiscal year '24, as we saw the consumer come under more pressure, and we originally had the assumption of a mild recession which we are no longer assuming, but still assuming that consumer is going to be under more pressure given all the factors in the macro-economy. And so that's consistent with that. And if you look at our categories, given they're all mostly household essential categories, we would expect no large difference in those categories. We might see little nuances here and there, but on average, we expect all of them to be slightly slower. And that's consistent with what we've seen in the past in times like this. But I wouldn't call out anything in particular that would be a wide variance to that assumption. Anna Lizzul : Thanks for that. And just a follow-up on the organic sales question earlier on the Lifestyle segment in fiscal Q2, we saw a negative price mix. Can you just tell us what is driving that and should we expect to see negative price mix in the back half of the year on this? Thanks. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure. As it relates to Lifestyle that was in our Burt's Bees business, we do quite a bit of holiday gift packing and merchandising in the second quarter on that business, and so you have increased promotional activity. And so that was specific to the second quarter. And you may see that occasionally based on merchandising plans as we go forward. Anna Lizzul : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey guys. Just maybe looking beyond fiscal '24, I think the tailing question today is probably the earnings outlook as we look out to fiscal '25. I know obviously you won't comment on that directly, but maybe just looking at a couple line items. First, Linda from a top line standpoint, obviously, a lot of moving parts. Are you pretty comfortable now that longer term retailer relationships have not been impacted from a systems issue? Do you have a line of sight to eventually regaining full distribution to Andrea's question understanding the job's not done, but do you think you have that line of sight? And also maybe just an update on the competitive environment near term, are there any pricing or promotional concerns that have cropped up from competitors recently, given some of the volatility that might linger as we look out over the next year or two? And how you think about that? Linda Rendle : Sure, thanks for the questions, Dara. So, obviously, as you said, we won't provide any perspective on fiscal year '25, but the thing is that you've outlined are important as we think about closing out this year. And then, of course, the future of our continued commitment to grow top line while rebuilding margins. And what we see from a top line perspective is very strong brands. And I think I'd highlight again what I called out around brand superiority. Even in the out-of-stock issue that we experienced and cyber, we maintained our brand superiority ratings, which is significantly higher than it was pre-pandemic. So our brands continue to remain strong and we feel great about the investments we have in the back half, both increasing our advertising and sales promotion levels and we're going to spend about 11% this year. We continue to expect that. And we do expect trade promotion to increase as Kevin highlighted earlier. And innovation plans. We've also spoken about the fact that during the cyber incident we walled those resources off and so our innovation plans remain on track and we expect innovation across every major brand at Clorox. And we'll continue to invest in those plans. So I feel great about the brand's health going into this. From a category perspective, as we said, we expect to see some moderation in category growth. We tend to fare well in times when the consumers stretched because we offer value superiority. And in fact we're seeing in many cases, people still trading into premium segments of our business, we're seeing that in wipes, we're seeing that in premium litter, we're seeing that in our food business and across many others. So feel really good about where we stand with the consumer, even as they are more challenged and we're not seeing excessive trading to private-label. We did see some during our out-of-stock period, but we're seeing that rebound as we get back on shelf. And then retailers. I'll just take another moment to thank them and I can't thank them enough. They've been tremendous partners. And I say with confidence our relationships are stronger coming out of this. Unfortunate incident than they were heading in and they were strong heading in super grateful for their partnership and what they've done and we're back focused on category growth and focused on finishing the job on distribution. And I have full confidence given the plans that we have that we will restore distribution. It will just be how fast we can do it and on what timing. And again, some of those things are out of our control. But we have the right plans, we have the right relationships and strong brands to get it done. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. And can you just comment on the promotional environment. And if I can slip in one more Kevin, on the margin front. You talked about leaving the year at 42%, but still well below peak levels of 45% to 46%, if you go back historically. You mentioned in response to Peter's question that there'll be progress in fiscal '25, just help us understand potentially the slope of that gross margin recovery over time, the key drivers and how you think about long-term potential relative to that peak historical level. Thanks. Linda Rendle : Sure. On the merchandising and competitive front, we continue to see merchandising levels below what we saw pre-pandemic. And we expect in the back half for those to continue to ramp up. But what I'd say is, some of that was depressed given the fact that we were out-of-stock and not had as much merchandising. But we're not seeing anything in any material way, where we're seeing deep discount price merchandising, where we're seeing a fundamental change. But we would expect that, that level to rise, consistent with a more pressured consumer. And I would say there are little pockets here and there in categories, we're seeing some competition in litter, where there's a bit more aggressive merchandising and price promoting going on, but nothing outside of what we have assumed in our outlook from our categories and competition. And again, we continue to expect merchandising to increase both ours and competition in the back half, but we don't expect that to go to levels beyond what we thought pre-pandemic. And we'll see how that plays out. Kevin Jacobsen : And then, Dara, on gross margin. Yeah, as I said, getting to about 42 as our exit in Q4, I expect we'll make more progress in fiscal year '25, and I'm sure you can appreciate. I'll refrain from being too specific. We haven't finished our planning yet for '25, but here's what I expect, we will continue to drive cost savings. And as you know, we target 175 basis points of EBIT margin expansion each year. Last couple of years, we've been doing north of 200. So we'll continue to drive cost savings. If you assume we're going to move into a more normalized cost environment, potentially even some cost deflation, you can see how that 200 basis points can quickly start advancing our gross margins. It's not being absorbed by cost inflation. So that will be what we expect going forward. We'll have to see where the cost environment is when we get there. Pricing will play a smaller role as we've now lapped US pricing, we're still doing some pricing international, but that will play a smaller role. As we mentioned, we continue to expect improving volume trends, which will certainly contribute to margin expansion as well. So as I said, we're going to make progress. It's hard to call when we think we'll get back to that initial margin, we talked about 44%. It's hard to call exactly when we'll get there because it's not fully in our control. Some of that's going to be driven on how the cost environment plays out. If we see deflation, it could move more quickly, and if it's still continues to inflate, it may take a little bit longer. And then, I think once we get back into a more normalized environment, typically, our cost savings is more than enough to offset a normal level of cost inflation and we can take a little bit to the bottom line. And that's how you get that 25 bps to 50 bps of EBIT margin expansion each year ongoing. So I think, job one is to get back to that 44%, we remain committed doing that. I think over time you get back to a more modest improvement year after year in a more normalized cost environment. Dara Mohsenian : Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Filippo Falorni : Hey, good afternoon guys. So, Linda, I wanted to go back to your comment of, there is still some jobs to be done in terms of recovering shelf space. Maybe moving in a few categories if I look at the track channel data, there's three big categories where your total distribution points are still below pre-cyber-attack levels particularly trash bags, bleach and cat litter. Maybe you could give us a color like what are your plans are to get the shelf space back. Linda Rendle : Sure, Filippo. Just in aggregate, so that we're completely clear, we are still -- have fewer distribution points than we did pre-cyber. But we are close to restoring at an aggregate enterprise level. So as I mentioned earlier, we were down well over 30% in average weekly distribution points at the low point of our out-of-stocks and now we're mid-single digits on average. But you're right to call out that in particular, trash and cat litter, we're actually more on track to what we originally expected in Q2 and we were able to in the rest of the categories accelerate the distribution point recovery. But trash and cat litter were more on the schedule that we had expected them to be in Q2 and there's really two things driving it. The first on cat litter is the ongoing catch up that we're playing as the category has grown so fast to catch up from a supply perspective to demand. We continue to expect to make progress on that this year, but that's part of the reason why cat litter is slightly behind. And then trash. That's a complex category and we prioritized a certain set of items to ensure that those were on-shelf fast. And with that, we have to bring back the full distribution, particularly, I'll call it, large sizes, is one that we have not fully restored yet. We have plans to do that in these upcoming resets. Those are important items in the category and retailers realize that. And we feel we have the right plans in place to get them back, but those are two categories that will look more like we had thought at the beginning of Q2. But just like the rest of the categories. We believe we have the right plans. We will make progress in Q3 and Q4. And we're not seeing anything abnormal from a consumer perspective that gives us any concern of our ability to do that. Filippo Falorni : Great. That's super helpful. And then Kevin, two quick follow-ups on the gross margin. First on the commodity line, it was neutral this quarter. You talked about maybe a more favorable environment. Are you expecting some deflation in the second half, meaning a benefit? And then on the manufacturing and logistics, maybe you can walk us through the drivers on that line as well. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure, Filippo. As it relates to maybe I'll start with all three and just talk about inflation. As you know, we came into the year expecting about $200 million worth of cost inflation. Some of that in commodities, but more of that in manufacturing and logistics, primarily driven by wage inflation. What I would tell you is we're seeing a little bit of improvement in commodities, it's a little bit better than we anticipated. And keep in mind, we forecast, not based on spot rates, but based on forward curves. And so I'd say we're still generally in that $200 million range, but a little bit better news we're seeing on commodities. Now having said that, that's before we factor in, Argentina and sort of the new reality in Argentina. But if I exclude that for a moment, I'd say generally playing out as we expected about $200 million of inflation, mostly in manufacturing and logistics. You don't see it as much when you look at our web attachments in the front half of the year. We had a number of charges last year that we're lapping. We should add more favorability in manufacturing, logistics, but that was offset by inflation in the front half and you get to a pretty neutral outcome is what you're seeing for the front half. And now when you add in Argentina, we're forecasting now almost 300% inflation in that economy. So we are seeing more cost inflation broadly across the supply chain, including commodities. And so I expect to have unfavorable commodity inflation in the back half of the year, a little bit of the US, but more so being driven from Argentina. But what's important to note, and I mentioned this earlier in Argentina, if you step back from all the noise and where it shows up in the P&L, we believe we have a plan to fully cover the negative impact to our P&L through the increased pricing we're taking. Filippo Falorni : Got it. Super helpful guys . I'll pass it on. Kevin Jacobsen : Thank you. Operator : And we'll move next to Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Christopher Carey : Hi, everybody. So just a couple of question then kind of a broader question. Number one, are you or did you experience any negative impact from a delayed cold flu season that we should anticipate some benefit going into the March quarter. And then to just follow-up there on Argentina, we've seen some companies cap the level of pricing so as not to, I guess, take all of the inflationary pricing that we just need different methodology. Is it fair to assume that you would strive to offset all the inflation in Argentina as it gets worse, just so we know how to kind of try to track this going forward. And I have a follow-up. Linda Rendle : Sure. Yeah, Chris, I'll start with the cold and flu. And just so we're all level set. Cold and flu is actually this year very similar to previous cold and flu seasons that we saw before. So definitely different than last year. So started later than last year, but more like an average cold and flu season which we typically see in January and February, so I would say normalized is the assumption that we have. So too early to say what the impacts will be we'll obviously talk that when we talk Q3. But we're looking at an average cold and flu season. And to your point, that means as we lap it the lap looks different because we experienced cold and flu earlier last year. And we'll be experiencing a more normalized, so mostly a Q3 impact for cold and flu that's been contemplated in our outlook. And we have like we normally do normalized assumptions around cold and flu and we'll see how that plays out. But to-date it looks like a very normal cold and flu season. From an Argentina perspective that would certainly be our perspective and as Kevin highlighted we intend right now with the plans that we have and what we're seeing in Argentina to fully offset the impacts through pricing. We'll see what happens as we move forward. That would continue to be our posture. And the reasons and proof points, we believe we can do it our market shares continue to be very strong. Our brands are very strong, we'll watch that closely but based on what we're seeing today, we expect to fully offset the currency headwinds with pricing. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah, Chris. The one item I'd add as it relates to Argentina is on remeasurement. It's worth noting that things you're modeling. In Argentina, you have to remeasure the monetary assets every quarter, and the more devaluation you have the larger charge you take to your P&L. In Q2 we took a $0.10 charge to the P&L. We have in our outlook, the assumption we're going to take about a $0.20 charge in total, we took $0.04 in Q1. So most of the charge we're taking, which is roughly $30 million, we've taken in the front half. But we do expect there'll be some more remeasurement impacts to the P&L in the back half of the year, but it's fairly modest given what we've already taken to-date. Christopher Carey : Okay. And then just one additional clarification on some prior questioning. So just to be clear, so you're mostly caught up on inventory levels, but not entirely caught up. And so we're still seeing negative trends on a year-over-year basis from a sales standpoint in the Nielsen data, for example. You should continue to outpace your consumption data for maybe at least another quarter. Is that a fair analysis? And then you would expect some acceleration in consumption going into your fiscal Q4, just any way you could frame that for us would be helpful. Thanks. Linda Rendle : What I would say is you've got it right and that you are hearing us correctly that we've restored the vast majority of inventory. We still have work to do to close all the way back to the distribution points that we were at pre-cyber. And so, as I said, we're still down about low-single digits, up from down over 30 points. And then, market share is the same thing I highlighted, we have work left to do, as we do two things, restore those distribution points and return to merchandising and fall on those two things will have an impact and output on share. I'd also say the underlying thing behind this all is, too, we have to do that work on the fundamentals, and we will. We also have to ensure consumers bought other items during this time when we're out-of-stock. And so we're also doing the disciplined work by brand to ensure that we get them back to The Clorox brands they know and love through our marketing efforts, through the efforts that we're talking with shoppers at the point of decide, and all that's going on track, but that's the work that we also have to do, not only just restoring distribution and merchandising, but also ensuring that we're getting that next purchase from people who may have tried something different during our out-of- stock period. Christopher Carey : Okay. Thanks so much. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Chris. Operator : And our next question will come from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hey everybody. It's a good segue from Chris' question on winning back some of the consumers that you lost. I guess you're holding advertising flat as a percentage of sales, but your outlook for revenues are higher. So from a dollar perspective I suppose that's an increase. Is there an increase or is it about where internally you had expected to spend over the course of the year? Kevin Jacobsen : Hey, Kaumil, we're expecting increased spending. So as you know, we typically spend about 10% of sales, this year we're targeting 11%, and in fact in the back half it will be closer to 20%, so we're leaning in investing to continue to drive value superiority at an elevated rate. So year-over-year, it will be higher based on the elevated rate of spending we intend to spend. Kaumil Gajrawala : Got it. That's useful. Thanks. And then maybe a little more information on something you alluded to a few times on consumer pressure. Is it something you're already seeing or something you're planning for the back half and maybe if you could sort of marry that comments with some of what you guys have talked about as it relates to promo activity. Linda Rendle : The consumer has been fairly resilient and we've continued to say that, we saw that in the front half of the year. It is a little difficult in our categories to get a completely clean read just to be fair given that we were out-of-stock and so there's a lot of dynamics going on. But as we come back in stock we're seeing largely what we expected from the consumer in their front half which is a lot of resiliency. We continue to see value seeking behaviour. So we're seeing trading up to larger sizes, we're seeing trading into opening price points. Not seeing what we would expect anything different on trading into private label than we would have expected. Again, certainly more people tried private label when we were out-of-stock but we're seeing that reverse as we get back on-shelf. We continue to see a squeeze of other brands. So the leading brands and private-label tend to be the two that are doing well in categories that have multiple brands. So all of those behaviours continued in the front-half. What we expect in the back half is the consumer to continue to be under more pressure. That being said, our categories are fairly resilient, because we're household essential. So we're expecting a moderation, but this is not a reversal of the trends we've seen and we're seeing the shift from price mix being the driver of growth to volume, and that is certainly playing out. If you look at sequential volume improvement trends over the course of time, and if you kind of backup the effects of being out-of-stock from cyber, you're seeing consistently volume improving. At the end of December volumes were down very low-single digits for example, from a consumption perspective, if you look at the MULO universe. And we would expect to see that continue in the back half. So what we just see is consumer under more pressure, value seeking behaviours continue, a slight moderation in our categories, we've assumed all of that in our outlook. We'll continue to moderate. But to-date, the consumer has been resilient. And we think those things will play in through the other assumptions we have, like more merchandising in the back half. And you know competitors focused on ensuring that they are offering a great value to consumers as their wallets are stretched. But it's very, very consistent with what we had expected at the beginning of this year. We don't see any change in behaviour from consumer outside of those assumptions we had six months ago. Kaumil Gajrawala : Okay, great. Thank you. Well done. Linda Rendle : Thanks. Operator : And we'll move next to Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Stephen Powers : Hey, thanks and congrats from me, really to you and to the whole Company on pretty remarkable recovery these past several months. One quick follow-up and then a question. The follow-up, just on the categories that Filippo had mentioned, you talked about, there's still some work to do to fully catch up and recover. Is the expectation that as you exit fiscal '24 that you have fully recovered there or is there more work that you expect we should expect carries over into the back half of calendar '24 and fiscal '25? Linda Rendle : Hi, Steve, thank you for your nice comments. We really appreciate them. On those categories and I would say just in general, we intend to make as much progress as we possibly can in Q3 and Q4. Will there be some lingering effects that could be outside of our control, if there's a retailer reset or change, perhaps. But we are focused on getting as much of that back in Q3 and Q4 as we can. What I wouldn't say is, I wouldn't commit to any number at this point right now, except, we expect to make continued progress over the course of the next six months. I think for trash and litter, litter has been a challenge for a while, given that we've caught up to supply, so that is the one that we're laser-focused on, and has more to do with bringing new plant up to speed than it has to do with recovering from a cyber-incident itself. So, that will be one that we'll be watching closely and try to make as much progress on. But we are going to make as much progress as possible and we expect significantly more in Q3 and Q4. Stephen Powers : Okay, very good. And the question I had, if we step back from the last quarter, since August, when we go back to before the summer, we were talking about a lot of things, one of those topics was sort of the ongoing digital transformation of the Company, the operating model change that you guys have been working on sort of long-term strategic arc of business transformation. Has anything over this period since August set you back on that trajectory or have you been able to keep pace so that the progress that was anticipated at the start of the summer is still sort of broadly on track. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Steve. And just as a preview, we'll spend a lot more time at CAGNY and have a chance to talk about our overall transformation and in particular, the operating model and digital transformation. So I look forward to talking you all about that then. But right now, what I can say is, we are absolutely deeply committed to the strategic priorities, including those two areas of transformation for the Company. They are critically important for our success, they're about investing in the long-term health of our business and being ready to take on the challenges of the future, and so the commitment is absolutely there. What I'd say is, on the operating model, we were able to proceed even through the cyber-event, and executing that we remain on track to that plan. And as you can imagine from a technology side during a cyber-event, we've had some delays on our ERP. We'll talk to you more about the timeline of that when we finalize it. But we're still committed to the transformation and all of the elements of that. But of course, our team was focused on getting safe and secure and ensuring that we moved from manual to automated processes, as the number one priority and we are now returning to that digital transformation and we'll have more of an update in the coming months. Stephen Powers : Okay, excellent. I'll see in a couple of weeks. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Steve. Operator : And we'll move next to Javier Escalante with Evercore ISI. Javier Escalante : Hi. Good evening, everyone. I have -- I'm going to kick a deadish horse here, but I do have a problem with adding up into the second half forecast, particularly for the gross margin. So if you can help us with two items specifically, one is ForEx. How big Argentina can possibly be? Two, if you can help us understand and you mentioned that impact first on sales and gross margin as to basically be flat in the second half. So that's point number one. The other has to do with the job to be done and the two categories that you're investing or you are still about to invest trash bags and cat. They are very competitive, do you have competitors that have a value stand? So to what extent it's not an issue of distribution, but an issue of retailers changing the assortment or value and then you needed to basically buy up space features and things like that that is going to create a negative offset to gross margin. Thank you. Kevin Jacobsen : Hey, Javier, let me start with your question on FX and how it's impacting sales and gross margin. And when we entered this year, we were anticipating about two points of FX headwinds on the top line, mostly coming out of Argentina. The Argentina economy has declined more than we had anticipated. And as you may have seen in our prepared remarks, we're now anticipating about five points of FX headwinds on the top line that is solely a function of revising our expectations for Argentina. We now have in our outlook an expectation that the currency will devalue about 75%, and that's going to be back half loaded. If you look at the front half we had about three points of FX headwinds, and that puts you into the mid to high single-digit FX headwinds in the back half and again a function of Argentina. And then that also plays through in gross margins. We expect a greater negative hit to gross margins, as it relates to the FX impacts. So if you look at last year, FX was about less than 100 basis point hit, this year will be well north of that closer to 150 basis points or so. And again, it will be more pronounced in the back half of the year. Important to note that, maybe just to finish that up and I'll let Linda addressed the other question was, as I mentioned earlier, in-spite of those negative impacts based on the actions we have already taken and will take primarily as it relates to pricing, we believe, we can offset both the top line FX impact as well as the FX impact to gross margin. And as a result, you can see we're raising our sales expectation, expect to grow margins in-spite of a pretty difficult environment, we're dealing with there. Linda Rendle : Javier on the piece that you mentioned on those two particular categories trash and litter that we spoke about. It's exactly what we said it is from a supply perspective, those are two businesses that are a bit more challenged. We feel very confident in the health of our brands there. And as I spoke about from a superiority perspective, consumers just find value not as the lowest price, but of course, what is the overall best offering from them, which price is an element of. We feel great about the superior value of both of those brands when they offer. We continue to see our innovation do very well in both of those categories and we highlighted both of those in CAGNY some of the innovations we have, Glad with Clorox and other launches that we have in Glad that are similar and of course our outstretched cat litter which has done very well and it's held up even through out-of-stocks. We continue to see people trade in to premium cat litters. So we feel confident about our plans. Again, we have the right investment levels. And we're focused on providing exactly what you said, which is the right value to consumers and retailers see that, and we play an important role in their category growth. And I have confidence that we will retain or regain distribution, get back to the proper level of merchandising in these categories. And that will get our ourselves back to where they need to be just in these two categories, it's a little bit extended versus some of our other categories. But I have every confidence in these two that we'll get back, just like we are on the other ones. Javier Escalante : Thank you very much. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Javier. Operator : And we'll hear next from Callum Elliott with Bernstein Research. Callum Elliott : Great. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to build on Steve's question and hopefully not to pre-empt your CAGNY presentation too much. But alongside the digital transformation, you guys had other long-term initiatives before the hack that we're also targeting the top line. I think it feels like quite a long time ago now that you raised the long-term top line target to 3% to 5% driven by this push into international and professional. But hoping you can update or update us on those strategic initiatives and where we stand, now that we're hopefully starting to put the hack in the rear-view mirror. Thank you. Linda Rendle : Thank you. And we certainly want to get back to where we ended fiscal year '23. We were very proud of the performance and what we had done. And of course we remain deeply committed to what we talked about which is expanding top line over the long-term 3% to 5% and expanding EBIT margins 25 to 50 basis points and we want to get back to that. Exactly as you said and our transformation as a critical component of that and ensuring that we have the right capabilities and processes, and that people at Clorox are more consumer obsessed and we're working faster in a leaner fashion to get there and we'll talk about that. As we spoke about actually at CAGNY, I think, it's two years ago now, what we expected from a growth perspective continues to remain, we continue to see opportunities in international, we continue to expect to see returning to growth in our professional business as that more normalizes. But we spoke about all the other things that we had seen trend-wise. We saw more cat adoptions and so natural category tailwinds for litter. We saw people having increased interest in disinfecting which still remains and we still see that or seeing as we look at the data today. People still have a heightened need to have their spaces cleaned and disinfected. People generally are taking care of their health and wellness more so, things like Brita have natural tailwinds. And water consumption. Our Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements business is the same thing, continues to have natural tailwinds. So we'll speak about all of that at CAGNY, but we remain committed to that 3% to 5% top line over the long-term and to do that in a more profitable and consistent way. And we have all the right levers and are pulling all at the right transformation buckets in order to do that, and I feel we're on the right path to get back to where we were coming out of fiscal year '23. Callum Elliott : Thanks, Linda. Linda Rendle : Thank you. Operator : And we'll move next to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks, everybody. So I was just looking back and I remember that last quarter when you were talking about the outlook and the recovery plan and expectations. That you said you expected customer inventory levels to be rebuilt by the end of fiscal 2Q. But tying to that was the conversation of mid-single-digit sales growth, right? So now retail inventories are in fact rebuilt, the main thing does it leave? But it was with sales growth that was way higher than mid-single-digit. So can you just tie those two things together for me because, I think the just the visibility in the forecasting I think is an open question. And if you go back even pre-cyber the pattern of exceeding your own outlook was incredible. But you do have to also ask the question of like what happens if it goes the other way, if this is a question of visibility. Linda Rendle : Hi, Lauren. Let me try to paint a picture for what happened in Q2. So we're all on exactly the same page. You are right to say that we expect it to build the vast majority of inventories by the end of Q2. What happened is, we did that faster so what you get less of a consumption loss impact in the quarter. So instead of doing that, call it, the last two weeks of December we did that earlier and earlier by categories. So you have less out-of-stocks which significantly increased our top line, and that's really the difference that you see in the quarter. And of course that had positive impacts in terms of the merchandising, we can do and all of the fundamentals from a retailer perspective that we want to return to and gave us great confidence in the back half. Not only do we take our outlook up because we over-delivered in Q2, but we see a stronger back half as a result of that. So that's really the difference is we have less lost consumption because inventories returned faster in the quarter than we had expected. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. That's fantastic. And then just also on Burt's, I feel like when we all saw you in December, at the time you were talking about the challenge of Burt's and restoring that business just because of the natural complexity of SKUs and the line-up in that business and that holiday merchandising might actually be -- that might be a spot where you'd fall short. When I look at the trends in Lifestyle, right, clearly, Burt's had a great quarter. So there too kind of same story or I'm -- just I'm a little confused on that one, because it felt like that was a business, that was going to be tough to be able to get that merchandising in and holiday is pretty -- it's a important seasonal time for that brand is my understanding. Linda Rendle : Yeah, Lauren. You remember correctly from December, we highlighted one of the places that we were focused on actually two places. We talked about cold and flu, if you recall and our push to get as much of that distribution restored to ensure that we could protect cold and flu, which we feel we did. And then second exactly right is Burt's Bees and the importance of the holiday period. We were able to do most of that. I would say for holiday, we didn't get all of it out, but we got the vast majority of holiday out which was good. And that certainly did support a stronger performance on Burt's than we had anticipated. But that was a big challenge, but I would say, unfortunately we didn't get it all out, and that certainly has an impact, but the good news, it was more positive than we even expected back in December for it to be. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, perfect. And then the final thing, sorry in this vein, but I'm just trying to put the pieces back together, if you will. Logistics that was one area, Kevin, where you had talked also last quarter about that logistics cost would be elevated this quarter because as you mentioned, Linda you're shipping well above normal every day, right and that you're going to end up using a lot more carriers and freight and so on, beyond what you'd normally be contracted for, and that there'll be elevated cost with that. Again, like, I know there's many pieces of that gross margin build, but logistics is one that really jumped out for us, it's being pretty different. So I'm just not -- that's another area of question of kind of what played out differently there, was a retailer fine. I think you mentioned that in the prepared remarks, but that seemed like a pretty significant difference versus something that should have carried elevated cost within the quarter itself. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah, Lauren, you remembered exactly correct, when you think about the gross margin for the second quarter came in higher than we expected, both the combination of stronger top line. But exactly what you just highlighted, we did not incur the up charges we anticipated. If you remember, when we were talking last quarter, we said our priority, job one is to get product back on shelf as quick as we can. And we were fully prepared to incur additional logistics manufacturing up charge to get that done. And that will take the form of running the plants more over time, less than full truckloads out of route shipments. We said that was all available and we expect to do some of that to get product there quickly. A credit to our team and as Linda mentioned, and a credit to our retail partners here, as we move more quickly getting productive retailers, we did that in a very efficient manner. We did not have to incur the up charges, we were mostly using our carriers, we're mostly being able to do that in full trucks. And because we got that done even faster than we expected, it didn't bleed onto the full quarter. And so it's really about us executing more effectively than we anticipated going into the quarter. But we went in expecting we would have to spend more and we prepared to do that as we are prioritizing getting product on shelf, it just resulted in the fact we didn't have to. Linda Rendle : Yeah. I'll just maybe make another comment on our operating model. Lauren and there were some good questions on our transformation and are we continuing it. And I think one of the things really proud of is one we learned a lot in COVID that we applied to the situation. Unfortunately, we were hoping we'd never have to play it again, but we were ready to go. The second thing is, this is an output of our operating model, getting laser-focused on what matters, putting a business leader in-charge who sees end-to-end who is able to make the calls and trade-offs, and she and her team were able to do just that, to be able to restore inventories and do all those things. Kevin spoke about, not requiring a lot of overtime. Our decision to take, our inventories up in Q1 was an important one, and we knew that we would work those down, but we made that choice early to ensure that we could do as much as we could in Q2. But I would just plug our operating model. That's a real output of what we've been driving and that changed to be bought more business unit focus, more focused on the consumer and customer and fast. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. All right. Great. Thanks. I really appreciate it. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Lauren. Operator : And our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Olivia Tong : Great. Thanks. And great work on the improvements. In terms of the macro backdrop you talked about how -- for second half you're now no longer expecting the recession that you had before, but could you just talk about what your expectation target for the current environment to stay the way the second half to be similar to what we saw in the first half or that there is still a step-down just not as much as you had before. Linda Rendle : Hey, Olivia. On the macroeconomic and consumer front that's exactly right, we are no longer expecting a mild recession. Of course when we released our outlook six months ago, we said that's an assumption. And if it changes, then we'll adjust. But really what we meant by mild recession and the impact it would have for us is a more stretched consumer, and we continue to see this in environment that leads us to believe that consumers will be more stressed. And if you start to look at categories around us that certainly has been playing out, we feel the impact will be moderate to our categories, given the fact that we play in household essentials. But we are seeing consumers more use of credit. We're seeing them shift their behaviors and showing things that they value and don't value discretionary goods have been down for a while. And we see the cumulative impact of that, as they've gotten down to a place now where their savings were down to pre-pandemic levels, they no longer have that extra disposable cash even though employment remains high. We think that all adds up to a more pressured consumer. And we think the impact of that will be a moderate impact on our categories, as consumers are more conscious about how they spend their dollars. That's really the assumption. Again, the consumer has been resilient to-date, we continue to see that, but we are seeing them in our categories, they are value-seeking . And as I mentioned earlier, they are trading up to larger sizes, they're using opening price points, they are stretching their dollar they might be trading into an item they feel like is more multipurpose. And at the same time we're seeing them given the superior value of our products, they are trading at a premium, because they are not willing to trade-off efficacy, they are not willing to trade-off convenience. So we're seeing all of those things play out. But we just think the consumer will continue to be under more pressure, not in the form of we believe a mild recession anymore, but just all of the other macroeconomic factors that are out there. Olivia Tong : Got it. That's very helpful. And then relative to your expectations going into the year, obviously, putting aside the cyberattack. Do you think you'll end the year in line with the your -- start of your target on promotion and merchandising levels? Because I'm trying to understand obviously, there's a lot of puts and takes of where your expectations they're now versus in August before the cyberattack happened. But you had said in the past that perhaps we'd have to do a little bit more promotion, little bit more merchandising just to make sure that given what's happened. Just wondering, today what you're thinking in terms of the level of promotion merchandising relative to where you started the year. Linda Rendle : Yeah, on that assumption, certainly we saw a dip in Q2 given the out-of-stock situation. And we had to prioritize, ensuring that we got supply up before we could merchandise. But now that we're returning distribution and market shares, we would expect promotion to pick up and we expect for the back half the same assumption that we had at the beginning of the year, which is higher than it had been, and returning closer to pre-pandemic levels. We don't think that merchandising will exceed pre-pandemic levels, but begin to return to that level. As people are focused on a more stressed consumer and continuing to offer the right value. And of course, doing things like releasing innovation, ensuring we introduce consumers to new items and great innovation. So that's what our expectation continues to be, we'll see merchandising increase than what it was last year, getting closer to pre-pandemic levels and we expect that to happen over the course of Q3 and Q4. Olivia Tong : Got it. Thank you so much. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Olivia. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle I'd now like to turn the program back to you. Linda Rendle : Thank you, everyone. As we covered today we've made strong progress on our priorities in the second quarter. While there is still more work to do to fully recover in the market from the cyber incident, we're focused on executing with excellence and delivering on our strategies to drive top line growth and rebuild margins. Guided by our IGNITE strategy, we're confident we have the right plans in place to deliver long-term shareholder value creation. And as I mentioned earlier in the call, we look forward to sharing more with you in our upcoming presentation at the CAGNY Conference in February. Until then please stay well everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Clorox Company Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. Lisah Burhan : Thanks Paul. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. On the call today with me are Linda Rendle, our Chair CEO, and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. I hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release and prepared remarks, both of these are available on our website. In just a moment, Linda will share a few opening comments and then we'll take your questions. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, including about our fiscal 2024 outlook. These statements are based on management's current expectations, but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements, which has been filed with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the non-GAAP financial information section of our earnings release and the supplemental financial schedules in the investor relations section of our website for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Now I'll turn it over to Linda. Linda Rendle : Thank you for joining us today. During the third quarter, we continued to progress our recovery from the August cyber-attack while advancing our Ignite strategy to build a stronger, more resilient company. For the most part, our progress in the third quarter was in-line with our expectations. Sales came in lower, as a few businesses experienced slower supply recovery than we planned. Gross margin came in higher, benefiting from our margin transformation program and a [modernized environment] (ph). Despite lower sales and strong investments in our brands, we finished the quarter ahead of our expectations on adjusted earnings per share. Before we turn to questions, I think stepping back and putting these results in context is important. Given the magnitude of disruption from the cyber-attack, we knew our plans to restore the fundamentals of our business would be complex, and a recovery path would not be linear. We have made tremendous progress and are laser-focused on finishing the job. We tracked well ahead of our expectations in the second quarter and knew we had more work to do as we entered the back half of the year to return our business to the strong trajectory it was on at the start of fiscal year 2024. This included fully rebuilding inventories, restoring normalized service levels, and rebuilding commercial plans for each of our businesses, which we accomplished by the end of the third quarter. These actions unlock our ability to fully restore lost distribution due to the cyber-attack and return to normalized merchandising levels as planned in the fourth quarter. Through Q3, we have regained nearly 90% of the market share we lost and expect to make further progress in Q4. With service levels now normalized and strong investment levels behind our brands, we're confident we can rebuild household penetration and return to volume growth over time. Despite the significant disruption and lost sales we've experienced and based on our team's strong work, we are now positioned to exceed our original gross margin target and meet or exceed our adjusted EPS guidance we provided at the beginning of the year before the cyber-attack. Importantly, our recovery progress to date puts us in a good position to exit fiscal 2024 with strong fundamentals. In addition, we continue to execute well against our IGNITE strategic priorities throughout our recovery. We made substantial progress rebuilding gross margins, continuing to target returning to pre-pandemic levels over time. We launched innovation invested in our brands and capabilities, progressed our streamlined operating model and digital transformation, and completed the divestiture of our Argentina business, which supports our goal of evolving our portfolio to deliver more consistent and profitable growth. In closing, we're taking the right steps to navigate the near-term and continuing to advance our IGNITE strategy. I'm confident we have the right investments and plans to deliver against our strategic and financial objectives and enhance long-term shareholder value. With that, Kevin and I will take your questions. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Linda. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Peter Grom of UBS. Your line is open. Peter Grom : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Hope you're doing well. I was hoping to get some more color on kind of the implied 4Q organic sales growth and how this informs you on kind of the path forward here. I know this was always the case, but it seems like you're expecting to kind of close some of these distribution gaps of 4Q, more or less implying that you're going to overship versus consumption. But when you kind of look at the implied 4Q guide and to kind of where you need to be to land at the low end -- of low single digits for the year, doesn't really imply a ton of growth considering this dynamic. So maybe first, am I thinking about that right? And if so, how does this exit rate inform your view on the growth looking out to next year just in the context of the long-term algorithm of 3% to 5%? Thanks. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Peter. Why don't I get us started and I'll just talk about some of the dynamics that we expect in the fourth quarter. And then I'll hand it to Kevin, and he can talk about the outlook. And of course, you'll appreciate we're not setting guidance for fiscal year \u201825 at this point, but Kevin can certainly give you how we're thinking about the exit. So as it comes to Q4, there are a number of dynamics and things that are important that we plan to do and have the right plans to address. And the first is what you mentioned. We intend to fully restore the temporary distribution we lost as a result of the cyber-attack. And we are well on track to do that. At this point, we know the decisions on the shelf resets from all of our major retailers. We built the inventory in order to supply those distribution losses and are on track to restore that distribution. So certainly, that will help both reported and organic sales as we head into the fourth quarter. The second dynamic is now that we have fully restored our ability to supply and are back to normalized service levels, we are going to return to our merchandising plans, which, if you recall from our earlier conversations, we expect to be higher than they were during the pandemic, basically returning to pre-pandemic levels. And that is on track as well for the fourth quarter, and both of those will support growth. The thing I would mention, And as you can see, the implied range is rather large. And that's because it's still quite variable and volatile what we're dealing with. We're dealing with a complex recovery. shelf resets are all at different times for our retailers. How fast those resets happen. And then, of course, where we are on the purchase cycle with consumers will matter, and that's informing the depth and breadth of that range. But I'll hand that over to Kevin and he can help you think about just how that plays out in the outlook. Kevin Jacobsen : Hey, Peter. You know, as it relates to the outlook and I think specifically your question, organic sales growth in Q4. What I expect to see occurring this quarter is improving volume trends. If you look at our volume performance, we're down about 7% the front half of the year down 4% in Q3. I expect that to continue to improve as we move forward. I also expect we'll see some increased trade spending. We continue to work back towards a more normalized promotional environment. Q3 was still below sort of that normal level, so I think you would expect to see some increased trade spending. And then as a result of the divestiture of Argentina business, it's gotten a lot simpler. I don't expect any FX headwinds. I don't expect any meaningful pricing now. Most of our pricing was in international -- that would all go away. So you should see improving volume trends, a little bit of uptick in trade spending, and that gets you down to probably flat to down a little bit in terms of organic sales growth in Q4. And that would keep us on track to be up about 1% for the year. Peter Grom : Awesome. Thanks so much for that. And Kevin, maybe just one follow-up or more of a piece of clarification. In the prepared remarks, you mentioned kind of building on the 43% gross margin exiting the year. Is that a broad-based comment, or are you talking specifically on building relative to the 4Q exit rate? Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah, I think there's a few things. You saw where we landed, Peter, in Q3, a little over 42%. We think we'll be closer to 43% when we exit. You know, as Linda said, we're not prepared to provide our outlook for next year. But I would tell you, we fully expect to continue to expand margins in fiscal year \u201825. So we'll exit this year. You know, over the full year, we're probably up around 42%. And I expect a bill on that next year. Peter Grom : Thanks so much. I'll pass it on. Kevin Jacobsen : Thanks, Peter. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JP Morgan. Your line is open. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, everyone, and good afternoon there. Linda, you mentioned in the prepared remarks few areas of the portfolio that experienced slower supply recovered than planned, that impacted the third quarter. And I understand the 10% that you mentioned that still is below the service levels. But relative to your 2% organic growth, how much was out-channel consumption given also comments in that same report that you experienced consumption losses? So can you elaborate more on which areas you were still below in share and what gives you confidence that the consumers you lost during that period within your consumption patterns would come back. And then Kevin, a clarification on what you just said about building margins into 2025 -- the fiscal 2025. How do you see rising prices in other commodities? Are you embedding these two inflationary commodities and how would you expect to offset that? Is that mostly on the savings? They IGNITE, how we should be thinking as we move forward. Linda Rendle : Sure. All right, I'll get started with that first question. And I think the question was twofold. So I'll start first maybe addressing the areas on supply that we called out that impacted sales for the quarter. And then I'll talk a bit more about the consumer and the confidence that we have about where we are and that we have the right plans in place as we roll into Q4 to continue to accomplish what we intend to do around the consumer and restore our business fundamentals. So in supply recovery, we talked about the last call and actually the call before that we had a couple of businesses that were more challenged given the depth of their portfolio. And that was Glad, and we called out Litter as well. And those continued to be a challenge a bit longer in the quarter than we had originally anticipated at the time of forecast. The good news is that with a few other minor things in businesses, we were able to fully fix all of those by the end of the quarter, and we exited Q3 getting back to normalized service levels to our customers. And so feel good that as we head into Q4, we have the right inventory and we have the right production plans and plans with our retailers to be able to get back all of those distribution points that we lost temporarily and, again, restore merchandising. So again, that was a temporary thing in nature, impacted Q3, but we don't anticipate that it will impact Q4. If you look at the consumer, a few things going on. First, our distribution points are still down versus pre-cyber, which we had anticipated. And we knew that the majority of shelf resets would happen in Q4. That is still going as planned and we expect to fully regain that distribution that we anticipated having at the beginning of the year when we set our original outlook. So on track there. And then I would say we're starting to see the share turnarounds. We've recovered nearly 90% of our share loss. And actually, if you even look at the last few weeks, you've continued to see that trend improve. And in addition, we're rebuilding households. So our households in Q3 are still down versus pre-cyber, which we expected, but improving and moving in the right direction. And if you think about it, we really only had from when we fully restored inventories, and again, haven't fully restored distribution, that's basically one purchase cycle for the consumer in our categories. Purchase cycle is about 90 days. So we've had one chance to influence as that consumer comes back to the shelf, and we're not fully restored yet. What we're laser focused on in Q4, and this is why we have the investment levels that we do, where we've increased our spending on advertising and sales promotion, as well as reduced revenue, ensuring that we have the right spending that in this next purchase cycle, that we can recapture that consumer. We intend to do as much of that as we can in Q4, and we're hoping to get the majority of it done. We're very confident in distribution, very confident in the merchandising, and now we're just watching as the consumer comes back to a fully-stocked shelf. What is their behavior, and do we need to make any tweaks as we head into the beginning of fiscal year \u201825, but feel very good about where we are in restoring the fundamentals and very good that we're beginning to see the consumer come back that we lost during that time. Kevin Jacobsen : Andrea, your question on \u201825 and gross margin, you know, as I'm sure you can appreciate, we're still in the process of building our plans right now for \u201825. But where we're sitting at today, I fully expect we're going to be growing top line, expanding margins, growing earnings. And so as you think about how we grow margin, I think to your specific question, certainly top-line growth helps build margin. Additionally, divestiture of our Argentina business, that was [margin-diluted] (ph) to the company. So, divesting that business certainly helps our margin. And then our margin transformation efforts. We think collectively that more than offsets what we believe will be a level of cost inflation but continue to moderate. So, we do not believe right now we're going to be in a deflationary environment next year. There will be some cost inflation, but it continues to moderate. And the actions I just mentioned we think are more than enough to offset that and allow us to continue to build margin next year. But the exact amount we're still working through. Andrea Teixeira : Yeah, thank you. That's super helpful. In Argentina, what is the impact of removing Argentina as a tailwind? Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah, we don't break that out, Andrea, specifically. But I can tell you it was significantly below the company average in terms of gross margins. You can probably do some math. It was 2% of sales and well below the company average in terms of gross margin. Andrea Teixeira : Okay, very good. Thank you very much, I will pass it on. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Christopher Carey : Hi, everyone. Linda Rendle : Hi, Chris. Christopher Carey : I wanted to ask about sales delivery in the quarter excluding international. So in the prepared remarks, you spoke about increased competitive activity as you were trying to get back on shelf. Price mix was negative in your key division in the quarter. And I'm trying to marry that with, I think you had sounded quite good recently on the logistical dynamic of getting back on shelf in the quarter. And so I guess I'm trying to put maybe altogether the why behind sales coming in a bit below your expectations and whether competitors are perhaps a bit firmer on shelf and share gains than you had expected, and you need to increase competitive spending, whether that's in price mix? And obviously, you called out some trade promo in your gross margins this quarter, to get back on shelf and whether you think to your comment to the prior question, you may need to actually accelerate that spending over the next several quarters if this shelf-uplift is not exactly how you expect. So you can tell, I'm trying to wrestle between not just that sales came in below the expectation, but the why and some of the actions that you seem to be taking to try and rectify the situation. Linda Rendle : Yes, Chris, we -- from all the data that we see, the progress we've made with the consumer and what we anticipate will happen here in Q4, we do not feel like we have a dynamic that the sales miss was due to a consumer issue that we have or not bouncing back to that degree with the household penetration we lost. This was simply we had two very complex businesses, we thought we would make more progress on supply than we did. It went longer, it went through the remainder of the quarter when we thought we would get it done mid-quarter. That impacted our ability really to supply for merchandising mostly. Distribution, we always knew would come back in the fourth quarter because that's when retailers reset their shelves. So the good news is because we were able to fully restore supply by the end of the quarter, we're still on track to recover that distribution. But this really was heightened competition as we weren't able to supply merchandising events and still not in a place where we were fully able to supply on those couple of businesses. But we're through that, we got through that at the end of Q3. We have the ability now to fully supply in Q4. That investment level, we feel is the right investment level. And I'll just be clear, we have not constrained our businesses. We have said they should spend what they need to -- to get these households back. That is contemplated in the outlook that we provided and we believe we have the right spending on both advertising and [self-promotion] (ph) and merchandising. And if we have to make adjustments as we go through the quarter, we will. But right now, we feel like we have the right plans, we are seeing those households come back. Again, we went through one purchase cycle. We're going through another one here in Q4, but all indicators are that we will restore our business. And we feel like the fundamentals will be fully recovered by the end of Q4 and set us up well as we head into fiscal year '25. Christopher Carey : Okay. One quick follow-up would just be Manufacturing and Logistics was a 210 basis point negative impact to gross margin in the quarter. That's a pretty notable step-up. And I don't think we're seeing logistics inflation at that level. Kevin, can you maybe just contextualize what happened there in the quarter? And whether that specifically is durable going forward or whether this is just an anomaly? Thanks. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure, Chris. The increase you referred to that is primarily driven by inflation in Argentina, you might recall before we divested that business, we were projecting about 300% inflation, and they had a significant devaluation in December. So that was playing through and it's the biggest driver. To your question, as you go forward now that we divest the business, I would not expect to see Logistics and Manufacturing be that level of a drag. Logistics is turning on us, it's fairly benign in terms of year-over-year cost once you strip out Argentina. So, this is one of the additional benefits of not having that business in our portfolio any longer, given the disruptions it had broadly across the P&L. Christopher Carey : Okay, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Dara Mohsenian : Hi guys. I get you don't want to be too explicit for fiscal '25 at this point, but I just had a follow-up question on top-line growth as we move into next year just relative to a normal base this year. Kevin, can you just talk about or Linda, any puts and takes as you look out to fiscal '25 as we think about top line growth? And maybe also just quantify what level of sales did you lose in fiscal '24? Do you expect to lose in fiscal '24 from the systems issue relative to a typical year? Kevin Jacobsen : Hi, Dara, what I'd say it's a little too early for us to talk too specifically about the '25. As I said, we're still developing our plan. Maybe the one item, I would just make sure remind folks is, with the divestiture of Argentina business, that's about 2 points of sales. We'll see a portion of that in Q4, but you'll probably still have about 1.5 point headwind next year as a result of that sale. But for the other items, we're going to wait until August to have that conversation because we're still working through our plans. It'd just be too early to talk any detail. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. And then on gross margins, you talked about a CAGNY to focus on holistic margin management and RGM. Can you give us a little more color on how important that might be over the next couple of years? And as you think about recovering gross margin pressure over time as you indicated in the prepared remarks, is that a big piece of the recovery? And as we think about the recovery, is this a multi-year effort? Should we think about a lot of progress coming out in fiscal 2025? How do you think about that conceptually from a timing standpoint? Linda Rendle : Sure, Dara. Without obviously, again providing any guidance for 2025 or beyond on specifics. I think I can say with really strong confidence, one based on the track records, if you look, we've delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion behind this toolkit that we have. And what we talked about at CAGNY is important. Pricing and cost savings have been the majority of the tools that we've had, and we put them to good use over the last couple of years as we've dealt with inflation. But we knew that we wanted to take a broader look and the fact that we are implementing a digital transformation, and we have more visibility end-to-end, gave us a great opportunity to look and see where else can we go beyond traditional cost savings. Revenue growth management is certainly one of those tools, price pack architecture within that. And the teams all have plans in place to use those tools to continue to make progress against our commitment that we stand behind to return gross margins to pre-pandemic levels and then grow from there. And we feel very confident in our ability to do that. Kevin and I have talked before, it's really dependent on two things. One how fast we implement this toolbox and feel good about that. But second will be what the cost environment looks like. And as what we continue to look forward, we continue to see inflation in people's reporting. Again, we are not providing any specifics around our business at this point. But the pace of recovery and when we returned to pre-pandemic levels will be those two factors, but we feel very good about what's in our control and that we have the right toolbox to be able to accomplish what we set out to do. Dara Mohsenian : Okay, thanks guys. Linda Rendle : Thanks Dara. Operator : Our next question comes from Anna Lizzul of Bank of America. Your line is open. Anna Lizzul : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for the question. You mentioned in your prepared remarks a consumer who remains under pressure. I was wondering if you're seeing this across all income tiers? Or is this comment primarily related to the lower income consumer as some other companies have indicated so far in Q1? And then you mentioned your levels of merchandising and promotion are increasing along with the higher advertising spend in the second half here. So, just wondering how much of this is driven by the need to rebuild share loss from the cyber-attack versus just trying to win over a financially weaker consumer. Thank you. Linda Rendle : Sure. We're seeing pressure across all consumer groups. And we are seeing behaviors broadly outside of our categories changing for nearly everyone, as they evaluate what's going on. And as they think about what's happening in the future whether that come down to the interest rate environment, et cetera, cost of housing, a cost of a basket of groceries when they go to the store. So we are seeing that behavior quite broadly, and we called it value-seeking. People are buying larger sizes, they are buying smaller sizes and they are thinking about the trips they take, et cetera. I would say, in particular, we always have our eyes focused on the lower income consumer as they are more pressured. And I -- and to-date, we have stood very well with them. And we tend to do it during times -- tough economic times for low-income consumers because we deliver products at a great value that work really well, and they can't afford to make a mistake in our categories. And so we typically fared-well, and we continue to see that we are doing well with low income consumers. And we haven't seen a material trade to private label that isn't due to the cyber-attack. And of course we are watching that closely as we get our distribution and our merchandising back, but we largely believe private label growth is due to the fact that we weren't on the shelf. And we are seeing Q3 their share was lower than it was in Q2. We are seeing all the right indicators our households are coming back that might have tried private label during that time when we were off the shelf. So we're watching all income tiers always focused on low income, but that was a very general comment to say that all consumers are under more pressure and are certainly evaluating their behaviors and how they are spending their wallet. And then when it comes to our spending plans, we had always anticipated that we would return to pre-pandemic merchandising levels before we even saw a more stressed consumer. Because we just thought that was the right level of spending to ensure we were introducing people to new innovation making sure that we are capturing new behaviors in times where consumers are open to that. For example, when they send their kids back to school or when they send the kids to college. And so we'd always anticipated that, and that -- this promo though does also support our return to share growth and our return from a distribution perspective. So we like that it works doubly hard for us. But I wouldn't say, we are doing this because of our recovery from cyber. We just always anticipated that this merchandising level of return. And then from an advertising and sales promotion level, we did increase that this year because we saw a pressured consumer and wanted to make sure that we were communicating our superior value, et cetera. But these are all within the range of normal spending for us in a given year. We typically spend around 10% in advertising and sales promotion. It will be closer to 11% this year, and we are returning to a level of reduced revenue spending that we've had in the past. So, we don't see any need to go further or deeper than that. We feel like we have the right level. But this really is about more normal course of business than it is that we're seeing consumer behaviors that we need to react to. Anna Lizzul : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Javier Escalante of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Javier Escalante : Good afternoon everyone and thank you for the question. I actually have two. One is if you could -- on the commentary when it comes to market share and household penetration, it feels as if you are referring always back to the cyber-attack. But if I understand the trajectory correctly, there was also market share losses relative to say pre-pandemic because of the supply chain issues that you mentioned. So if you can comment on that -- whether the intent is to restore market share to pre-pandemic levels in these highly contested categories like pet litters and trash bags? And then I have a follow-up. Linda Rendle : Sure, Javier. I mean it has certainly been a complex last few years and lots of puts and takes. And so what I would comment on is we intend to grow market share. That is our mid- to long-term goal, and that is the bar we hold for ourselves to say if we are winning with the consumer or not. Clearly, given the cyber-attack, we have not grown market share this year, but we're seeing the trend move in the right place. So for perspective, we lost about 5 points of share, nearly one-third of our market share during the low point from a cyber perspective. And we are back down -- we ended the quarter down about [0.75] (ph). We've made progress since there if you look at the weekly data. But what we first need to do is restore market share and then grow from there, and we believe we have the right plans to do that. If you look at many of our businesses, they are variable versus the market share they had in the past. But in aggregate, we mostly returned and some businesses were higher, for example, on our cleaning business. We made significant progress on market share, even though we had COVID and then, of course, multiple rounds of pricing. And our brands have held up really well. So my evaluation would be heading into the cyber that we were in the right place from a market share. We had plans to grow market share. Cyber has unfortunately caused another place where we took a step back, and we have to rebuild, but I'm confident in our ability to return and then we're working on plans in fiscal year '25 and beyond to deliver that market share growth we aspire to. Javier Escalante : Thank you. And then the follow-up, and it's a little bit in the line of Chris' question. It seems -- rarely you are seeing consumer businesses, and it could be accounting that you have negative pricing and negative volumes at the same time in the quarter. So what gives you confidence that you didn't take too much pricing and the value players are gaining share in trash bags and pet litter and I believe most recently in Glad that you don't need to reset prices into 2025. Linda Rendle : Yes. I would say, first of all there is a price mix in a trade component of Q3, and certainly, Kevin can walk through that in more detail. But if I just take step back and say, what were the dynamics in Q3 that give us confidence and what were the dynamics that negatively impacted us? It's pretty clear. We weren't able to fully supply on a couple of those businesses that you mentioned, Glad and Litter in particular. And that means we weren't fully available for the consumer, which we don't like. But the good news is, as I've said, we recovered that ability to supply by the end of Q3, and we feel good heading into Q4. And also, there were more competitive dynamics, given that fact that we couldn't fully supply. We saw more merchandising from competitors, et cetera. As it specifically relates to private label, if you look -- there was a stressed consumer prior to the cyber event, and we didn't have any material loss to private label and share during that time, nor have we, in any recessionary time lost any material share to private label. We offer brands with great value. We offer innovation, the consumer trust us, they love our products. They love our brands, and we spend behind those brands to ensure that they understand the superior value we deliver. And we see that beginning to take hold and work in Q3, as we restore distribution and inventories. We saw private label share come down versus Q2 and heading in the right direction back to what we would expect it to be in a more normalized environment. We expect to continue to make progress as we restore distribution in Q4. So I think it would be pretty understandable to say -- when you are not fully on the shelf and you don't have all your distribution, a consumer is going to choose what's on the shelf, and they did. And -- but we feel confident in our brands, confident in our spending plans that we'll restore that back. And history would tell us when we were out of stock in COVID that happens. When we've had product issues where we're out of shelf on time sell, we came back. We restored our share in distribution. We have a long history of doing this, and I remain confident in our ability to do it in Q4 and beyond. Javier Escalante : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni of Citigroup. Your line is open. Filippo Falorni : Hi, good afternoon guys. I first wanted to ask on the recovery from a shelf space standpoint. In prior earnings call, you sounded very confident that you're going to recover the full of the TDP that you still haven't recovered the distribution points. Is that still the expectation and in the quarter, and in the year, I mean? And was the weakness in the quarter? Like does that change a bit the full year expectation versus what you had expected, particularly for Glad and for the Cat Litter business? Thank you. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Filippo. We fully expect to recover in Q4, the distribution against our plan that we had fiscal year '24 that we lost. We view that as temporary. And we have seen the shelf decisions from retailers. They are now in the process of converting their sets. As we speak in some of our categories and some will happen throughout the quarter. So we have strong confidence that we will restore that distribution. And that really was not the Q3 story because we always knew most of that distribution would come back in Q4. That's really more of a supply and service level issue story in Q3. And again, we have fully recovered from that, and we are heading into Q4 in a great place. We're able to fully supply that distribution that we will recover. I'd also just note, I did a recent roadshow with all of our top retailers. And they want our business pack on shelf-two. We are the brand that leads their categories. They're very invested and growing with us. Our conversations we're focused on growing, moving forward, our innovation plans, what we want to do to unlock our joint digital plans now that we're well underway on our digital transformation, now that we know 100 million consumers, how can we personalize better to them. The conversations were very growth-oriented, future focused and they're looking forward to having our full distribution back as well so that we can grow their categories. Filippo Falorni : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe, Linda, just a longer-term question. I remember when you updated your long-term outlook to 3% to 5% from 2% to 4%, a component of that higher outlook was the international business. Obviously, you made the decision to divest Argentina. So maybe you can review what's left in the international business and how that contributes to your long-term target? Linda Rendle : Sure. You are absolutely right that we talked about international being a portion of that growth. And if you look at the performance of our International over the last couple of years, it certainly has played a role where it's growing faster. But we also talked about having a more consistent less volatile business. And Argentina was a high source of volatility and variability. And certainly, you saw the FX impact play out, and you heard Kevin talk about what we expect moving forward. So that was definitely on our minds to reduce the volatility and variability that we had and then be able to grow from a very solid base. And you might recall from a few years ago, we had purchased the majority ownership of a JV partnership we have in the Middle East, was a good example of looking at markets that we could grow faster in that were more stable and predictable and that has played out very well. We continue to have a really healthy consumer there. Innovation is working well in that marketplace. And so what I\u2019d say is, it's very consistent with what we've said before. We have continued business in Latin America that we feel good about, and we'll continue to grow business in Asia, Europe, the Middle East. And we continue to have growth pockets on businesses like Litter, et cetera, our cleaning business, which is the majority of our business is international and we continue to expect international to be a strong contributor, but it will be much more profitable and stable versus what it was before. Filippo Falorni : Great. Thank you. Linda Rendle : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Your line is open. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Just a couple of things. So first was just in the release you specifically called out that part of the increase in the gross margin outlook was a more favorable outlook for raw material cost or for input. So just curious on a little bit of color there. And then secondly was thinking about Argentina, I know we are not going to do business planning guidance for '25. But just thinking about when you lap Argentina, like Argentina FX is such a huge impact, for example, on gross margins even this quarter, last quarter. Do we like reverse that? Or is it just the impact disappear because the business is gone. I'm just kind of thinking ahead. Again, not about the totality of gross margin, but just how to think about the absence of Argentina moving forward and the margin impact on the business. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, Lauren, happy to take those. As it relates to gross margins \u2013 I\u2019m going to start there and kind of what we're seeing from a cost perspective. We are seeing costs continue to moderate, I think as you saw in Q3, is a fairly small impact, particularly if you look at commodities, we are seeing some commodities become deflationary. You see that a bit in soybean oil, which is something we use in our food business. You're seeing it in other categories, substrates, some chemicals. We are seeing still some cost increases, particularly on petroleum-based products, solvents, diesel. Resins up just a little bit. That's more supply-demand driven more than input costs. And so I'd say, it is definitely going in the right direction. It is a fairly modest hit for us in Q3, and that's certainly been an ongoing improvement. I would say, on the other piece of inflation, which is more wage driven, it's generally playing out as we expected. That tends to show up in manufacturing and warehousing. We're still seeing ongoing inflation there. But on the commodity front, it is certainly easing and as we step out of Argentina, which is a source of inflation, I expect it will be fairly benign by the time we get to Q4 on the commodity side, and then we'll continue to deal with the wage inflation. And then [how] (ph) thing about Argentina next year, I think you said exactly right, is -- as we move forward, a number of the areas you talked about, you will not have that impact going forward. So let me give you an example. You highlighted FX this quarter, to your point it was about 180 basis point hit to margin. That was almost entirely Argentina. As I look forward, even starting in Q4, we should have almost no FX hit to gross margin. So you get that benefit. But keep in mind, that will be offset by other areas, things like pricing, but pricing you see in Q3 was primary Argentina, that will also go away. So you'll strip all that out. Ultimately, the net impact of all that is Argentina was a margin-dilutive business for us. So by stepping out of that, all the different lines, when you look at it in totality, our margins will go up as a result of exiting Argentina. But you'll strip out each one of those elements that Argentina drove. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. And that impact from Argentina from the exit and just going back to it's actually a pretty small business. It is a small net impact when you put all these pieces back together on the year-over-year margin like in this quarter next year for example? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, that's right. I mean you look at the business, it is 2% of sales, and you can probably do the math pretty quickly. It is a very dilutive business to us that when we owned it and represents 2% of our sales. So you can probably do the math, you see there is some modest benefit to our gross margin going forward now is out of the portfolio. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Great. And then one thing I just want to clarify. I think I figured out the call in on, but there were two conflicting statements in the release in the prepared remarks about supply chain constraints being a problem in the quarter, but having resumed normal service levels. So I didn't know if it was a timing difference, like normal service levels as you exit the quarter, but constrained by supply chain during the quarter. I just wanted to make sure it's clear on how those two statements fit together. Linda Rendle : That's right, Lauren. So we were not able to fully service our retailers throughout Q3 until the end. So at the end of Q3, we restored normal service levels and we entered Q4 with them back to being normalized and that marries with the supply chain comment that we had some constraints, which impacted those service levels throughout the quarter. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, all right. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Your line is open. Olivia Tong : Great, thanks. I wanted to ask you two questions around margins. First, on gross margin. Obviously, the EPS outlook for this year is now higher than where you were pre cyber-attack and much of that is due to the gross margin expansion of about 100 basis points ahead of where you thought you were going to be at the beginning of the year. So in the past, you've talked about 200 basis points of gross margin improvement annually, as you recover from the post-COVID decline this year, now [$2.75] (ph). Last year, obviously, a lot more than that, despite all the ups and downs with the cyber-attack. So, can you just talk about ex-Argentina, ex the cyber, all these things, the ability to keep outperforming on gross margin, what you learned from this year last year, what capabilities continue versus some of the one-offs that are helping and hurting this year? Or just sort of the ongoing recovery on gross margin relative to the post-COVID timing? Thanks. Kevin Jacobsen : Sure, I'll be happy to take that one. As you think about gross margin, and you almost have to separate what we've been doing for the last several years in terms of where I think it's going longer-term. We're still working to recover from the record level of inflation that we've had to absorb. And as I think you know quite well, Olivia, we lost about 800 basis points in gross margin due to this inflationary cycle. And Linda and I both talked quite a bit, we remain committed fully recovering that. To your point, with the work we did last year, the work we're doing this year, we'll get about 650 basis points \u2013 we will recover. We've got more work to do and feel quite confident we'll get there. The process to get there, we were leaning into pricing. We took four rounds of pricing, which is very consistent with what you saw broadly in our industry to recover from this inflation. As we move forward though, now and get back into what I described as we believe a more normalized cost environment, typically, our cost savings efforts is more than enough to cover normal levels of inflation and allows a little bit extra that we can either invest back in the business, take to the bottom-line to further expand EBIT margin. And that's where that long-term goal of 25 basis points to 50 basis points was generated, which is normal level of cost inflation, which for us tends to be about $75 million a year. Our cost savings more than cover that and we use the extra to modestly improve margins each year. That's where we're going. We're not there yet. We're still working on recovering from the inflationary cycle, not was through pricing, but it's certainly moving in the right direction. So we will get back to fully recovering these gross margins over time. And then I expect assuming that the commodity environment gets to a more normalized level, that's how you should expect to see us continue to grow margins over the long term as our margin transformation efforts more than offsetting regular levels of inflation. Olivia Tong : Got it. And then just a point of clarification on your call for higher advertising in the second half --. Are you talking about higher as a percentage of sales sequentially or that the year-over-year change in second half is higher than it was in the first half? And how much of that is due to the clear pullback in spend in first half when you had -- you're out of stocks versus just desire to have greater programs, greater opportunity to support some of the innovation? Thanks. Linda Rendle : Sure. Olivia, if we wind the clock back to the beginning of the fiscal year, we actually had intended to spend more money in advertising and sales promotion in our original guidance, we said about 11%. And -- we still intend to do that. But you're absolutely right that given the cyber attack, the shape of that over the course of the year has changed. So we spent less in the front half of the year, we are spending more in the back half, still with the intention of spending. What we're seeing now is over 11% of sales. I want to be clear on the dynamics there, though. It is about -- we're spending about the same money we had intended. But given what we've talked about from a sales outlook perspective and Argentina it would put us above 11%. But we're still spending about the same amount of money as we intended to when we first gave that guidance. But again, this was more about supporting our brands as consumers are more challenged. We felt good about our innovation plans and we wanted to spend behind them. And again, just the shape of the year has changed given the cyber event. Olivia Tong : Great. Thank you. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle, I would now like to turn the program back to you. Linda Rendle : Thanks so much, everyone. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress on our next call. Until then, stay well. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. Lisah Burhan : Thanks, Jen. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. On the call today with me are Linda Rendle, our Chair CEO and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. I hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release and prepared remarks, both of these are available on our website. In just a moment, Linda will share a few opening comments and then we'll take your questions. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, including about our fiscal 2025 outlook. These statements are based on management's current expectations, but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section, which identifies various factors that could affect such forward-looking statements, which has been filed with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the non-GAAP financial information section of our earnings release and the supplemental financial schedules in the Investor Relations section of our website for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Now I'll turn it over to Linda. Linda Rendle : Thank you for joining us today. Our fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 results reflect the continued advancement of our strategy to strengthen our competitive advantage, accelerate profitable growth and set up our company for long-term success, all while navigating a recovery from the cyber-attack earlier in the year. Thanks to the team's execution, we ended fiscal year 2024 in a position of operational strength. We fully restored supply and distribution and recovered most of the market share that we lost. We closed out with flat organic sales for the full year, despite the significant disruption caused by the cyber-attack, which drove an 18% organic sales decline in the first quarter. Importantly, we continue to deliver on our commitment to rebuild margin to fuel growth, delivering our seventh consecutive quarter of margin expansion. We're on track to return to our pre-pandemic gross margins in fiscal year 2025. We also achieved another year of double-digits adjusted EPS growth. As we look ahead to fiscal year 2025, consumers will remain under pressure, which will continue to temporarily increase competitive activity and impact category growth. That said, we have a portfolio of strong brands in essential categories that have shown resilience during challenging times. We have and will continue to invest strongly behind our brands to maintain value superiority. While we have more work to do, we are confident that we have the right plans at investment level to win with consumers and deliver strong financial performance in fiscal year 2025, supported by a return to volume-driven sales growth, pre-pandemic gross margin and free cash flow in line with our long term goals. With that, Kevin and I will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Filippo Falorni : Linda, maybe I wanted to start with just the visibility on the top-line outlook. Obviously, you called out the dynamic in the first and second half. But given the consumer environment and the weakness that you're seeing and the promotional intensity in some of your categories, why are you expecting more of an underlying, particularly in the back half of the year from a volume and pricing standpoint? Do you expect still negative pricing to drive the volume growth? Any more color on the top-line outlook, understanding the dynamic in the first half? Linda Rendle : Sure, Filippo. Here's maybe helpful to kind of take a step back and frame what we have in front of us. I'll start just with the consumer environment to your point. The consumer environment is playing out as we expected. We certainly thought in the back half of fiscal year '24 that we would see, given the consumer is under pressure just more generally, we see that play out in our categories as we lap pricing, and as we saw competition in retailers react to trying to ensure that they get their shopper, et cetera. And so, that's played out exactly as we expected. We've seen category growth go from about mid-single-digits to low-single-digits, the softest month being in June. But what we see is generally what we've seen and what we've expected to see during this time. Consumers are continuing to be very focused on value. That means that, they are trading up to larger sizes, trading down. But our categories have been pretty resilient given that. Our brands, given their superiority and the fact that we've been rebuilding distribution and have fully rebuilt distribution coming out of the cyber-attack, our category is exactly where we expect them to be. I think moving forward, as we look at the year and to your point on front half versus back half, we continue to assume that the consumer will be under additional pressure, and that our categories will largely continue as we've seen them now, low-single-digits. And what we're really focused on is ensuring that, we're executing our spending plans. We have strong investment in ANFP, strong investment in innovation to support category growth as well as support share growth, which we expect this year and really focused on delivering superior value. And we know that, anyone can win in an environment where it's a little tougher, in the essential categories we compete in if we are laser-focused on delivering great value to consumers. That's exactly what we're focused on right now, to one, fully rebuild the momentum that we're still rebuild the momentum that we're still rebuilding in a couple of our categories coming out of cyber, and two to continue the momentum we're seeing in many of the other businesses that are restored. Filippo Falorni : And maybe one for you Kevin, on the gross margin clearly, outdelivery this quarter. What surprised you to the upside in the quarter? And as we think about next year, there was a lot of volatility in the manufacturing and logistic in the commodity front, maybe some level of expectation on those items for next year? Kevin Jacobsen : I'd say this year, as you know, in Q4 came in a bit stronger than we anticipated. The biggest driver of the over delivery for us is what we call business unit mix. Our household segment came in below our expectations and we over delivered our expectations on health and wellness segment. And if you look at our profitability, it's meaningfully different between the two segments. And so that mix generates some nice savings for us. And then the other areas, I'd say, is just generally a bit more favorable across the other lines of the supply chain. We had anticipated commodity deflation is a little bit stronger than we anticipated. Cost savings was another very good quarter for the company a bit more than we thought. We got some nice favorability across the supply chain, but the biggest driver was the BU mix that we did not anticipate. As I look forward to fiscal year 2025, kind of talking about the key drivers are, as Linda said, our expectations are going to add another 100 basis points and fully rebuild gross margin. I'd look at a few drivers. Supporting margin expansion, we're going to have another very good year of cost savings. We target 175 basis points each year of EBIT margin expansion. In the last two years, we've done over 200 basis points. I think this year, we'll do another year over 200 basis points with the bulk of that being in the supply chain. And then, we're also seeing some nice benefit from the portfolio work we've done. As you guys saw, we sold Argentina last quarter. We've announced that we're in the process of selling our VMS business. That's going to structurally improve our gross margins as we get through that. So that will certainly contribute to that 100 basis points. I think modestly offsetting that, I do expect a bit of increased trade spending as we get back to this normalized environment, particularly in the front half of the year, where our trade spending last year was below normal because of the cyber event. You'll see a little bit of year-over-year hit in the front half on trade. And then, we're assuming just a modest level of cost inflation, about $75 million across the supply chain, which will partially offset the margin accretion activity I mentioned. But, all in, we feel very confident in our ability to fully rebuild gross margins. And then going forward, as we've talked quite a bit, as our goal is to get back in that cadence of 25 bps to 50 bps of EBIT margin expansion each year. And we think we're set up to do that as we get into '26 and beyond. Operator : Our next question will come from Peter Grom with UBS. Peter Grom : Maybe just a couple of follow-ups on the top-line. Maybe just first, I would love to kind of get some perspective on the exit rates or kind of what you're seeing quarter-to-date in household relative to the organic growth you delivered in the quarter. I think the prepared remarks mentioned some of the distribution recovery occurring later in the quarter. So just curious if you're already starting to see that improvement as the recovery happens. Linda Rendle : Sure, Peter. I'll start us with that. And I think that's a helpful place for us to go a bit more into household and what happened there. That was the bulk of the miss that we had in Q4, but feel like a number of these businesses, to your point, we saw good trends heading out. First I'll cover, which you all know that our grilling business, the largest quarter we have is Q4. It's about 50% of our business and it's a heavily weather dependent business. Unfortunately, for both Memorial Day and July 4, weather was terrible in the U.S., very rainy for Memorial Day and extremely hot for 4th of July and that meant the category was down anywhere from high single-digits to double-digits. And as a result, our Kingsford business came in short of expectations. I don't look at that as any type of structural issue in Kingsford. We had good merchandising plans and where consumers did pull, we saw good take through. I think that is simply just the effects of weather, and obviously a portion of why we didn't deliver. And then two other businesses, which I'll break down in a little -- each is a little bit different. They share some same characteristics. But we've spoken a lot in the past about Glad and Litter. And those were the other two that contributed to the Q4 mess. And in the case of Glad, distribution recovery happens later in the quarter than we had expected, but we have fully recovered distribution. So feel very good on the exit rate from a distribution perspective. And as well, we talked a lot about the fact that when we were out of stock, we had a harder time getting our large sizes back, which is one of our biggest growth levers and critical consumers. They're looking for large sizes. They're going to buy a large size than another competitor. So we didn't know exactly what that purchase cycle would look like and that happened again later in the quarter when we saw people come back to our large size business. That being said, we think that was largely a Q4 dynamic. We have strong plans in place for fiscal year '25 across spending and innovation. And then just some data points to kind of show the extra rate coming out. Obviously, distribution, as I said, was fully recovered by the end of the quarter. That happened a little bit later than we expected. Shares trending in the right direction. We were down nine-tenth of a share point in April, but up to just down two-tenths of a share point in June. So a very big change as we got that distribution in place. We're back to growing share at our largest customer. And then on that very important large size business, that was actually one of Amazon Prime Day's number one sellers. And so feel like Glad is in a great position to deliver the growth that we expect it for in 2025. And then finally, for household, I'll cover Litter. And Litter is a little bit of a mixed story. Certainly saw improvement as we went through the quarter. We got distribution back to what we expected it to be, et cetera. But we are not fully capitalizing on the growth in that category at this point. And we have the operational things in place to do that. We've fully recovered supply. We have our customer service levels back to where they need to be. But, we recognize that this is a category that's going to take a bit more time due to its nature. Just a few things to keep in mind. One, you have some consumers who -- it's difficult to switch because their cat's used to a Litter. And that's a little bit more of a headache to switch litters back and forth when we were out and now back in stock. So we're working through that. We're beginning to regain those consumers back, but it's taking some time. This is a business that's heavily on subscription, which I've spoken about before. And while we've made progress getting people back to their subscriptions for fresh step, we still have more work to do. Then we've seen increased competitive activity as people become more value focused, et cetera. And so I think that dynamic in the category combined with just what's going on in the broader context of the categories, where everybody is really attuned to delivering for consumers given how stressed they are, that's a business that's going to take a little bit longer to recover. I feel fully confident in our ability to do it. We have strong innovation on that business. We have strong spending. But that's one that we're working week in and week out to get those consumers back and it's just going to take a little longer than we had originally expected. If I can to ladder all that up, I feel good. We had one business that was weather related, Glad on the right track, Litter improving, have more work to do. And I think that's what we're going to be working on that for the next couple of quarters. But we're really happy with the progress. We have superior value brands. We're investing them in strongly. And there's growth for us to go get. Litter is one where we haven't fully participated in that growth and we are laser-focused on ensuring that happens in '25 and beyond. Operator : The next question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Linda, if you can elaborate more on the elaborate more on the category health? You spoke a bit about how consumers continue to seek value. Wondering, if you can go through the key categories and give us a state of the union. And also in related to that, the RGM capabilities, I know you've in the past have done a lot of that. I wonder if you are, as you set up this 3% to 5% organic sales growth for fiscal '25, if you're deploying some ways of RGM that could help you achieve that. Linda Rendle : Sure, Andrea. On the category health piece, here's what I would say. The consumer is stressed in general, but our categories have been resilient and they're where we expected them to be. They're a bit softer, which is exactly what we've experienced in times when the consumer is more stressed. But given that we're in essential categories, they're pretty resilient. Obviously, our categories don't typically grow in the mid-single-digits range, but they did behind pricing. We knew some of that would roll off. But then we have this just additional pressure as consumers are more value focused. We've seen low single-digits. We've seen that bounce around, and we're watching it pretty carefully, but we see no signs right now where we're panicked. We see categories that continue to be resilient, consumers looking for value. Pricing is holding in the marketplace, which is great after taking those multiple rounds of pricing. You're seeing little changes here and there on how retailers are using promotion in the categories. But I would say, our categories are generally healthy and holding up, but just a bit softer as we would normally expect in a time like this. If I look, are there any special dynamics by category, there's still growth to be had. Cal Litter is a great example of one that I just called out that's been still growth-accretive from a category perspective for us. As consumers adopted more cats during COVID, they thankfully still have those cats, and they're investing in the well-being of their pets. I would say, every one category has the similar dynamics around value, et cetera. But we see categories with higher growth opportunities and somewhat a bit lower. But I would say again, they're pretty resilient. I think, if you look at private label, it's probably another important thing to cover. Private label was up about three-tenths of a share point in Q4, but that's coming off of what was some trading during our out-of-stock period. And we're seeing people come back to our brands. We're seeing the middle get squeezed again, which is usually what happens during periods like this. People change with the premium brand or in private label. We do not see consumers meaningfully move to private label in any way. Shares are pretty stable. I'd call out the promotional environment probably, Andrea, is the last thing to touch on. We had anticipated the promotional level would return to pre-COVID levels. We certainly anticipate that for fiscal year '25. Competition is pretty rational in that. We're seeing some pockets of more competition in categories like Glad and Litter and we would expect that, but generally pretty rational. We still think that assumption holds for '25 that will return to pre-COVID levels. It was slightly higher in Q4, actually partially driven by us, but competition as well, and as retailers try new promotional strategies. So, in general, for us, we think the categories are in a good place for us to do what we do best, which is focus on superior value, invest in our brands, ensure that we execute against the strong innovation plans that we have and we have those across all of our major brands again, and feel good about the position they put us in. what we would anticipate is, this slight slowdown will be temporary. We typically see this last 12 to 18 months and our categories would rebound to more of a mid-low single-digits growth number, and we'll just watch for that and be ready to ensure that our brands can take advantage of it. And then you asked on, RGM, Andreas. So I'll just touch on that too because it's so important for how we deliver value now but also in '26 and beyond. That's a relatively new capability for us. We've done some work by businesses. Glad is a great example where you've done some price pack architecture over the years. But we've built out a full capability in the company to take advantage of that and we see that being a top-line contributor and margin contributor for both '25 and beyond. A lot of the activity we'll do right now is really always on pricing, some initial price pack architecture work and we see even more of that in '26 and beyond. But that will be a huge growth driver for us, in the long range plan period. Operator : And we'll move next to Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Chris Carey : I wanted to come back to sales again. Actually, in a strange way, the fiscal Q1 organic sales guidance is actually a bit lower than what I would have expected a multi-year basis if you assume you get back to growth. Are you embedding a progressive recovery, I guess, in your sales curve as you get through the year? In another way, is this just you're not exactly sure where things are going to land such as the volatility? Or is there greater recapture of some of the initiatives that you're looking for into the back half of the year, which is why you have that strong back half organic sales guidance applied? And I have a follow-up. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. Hey, Chris, on Q1 sales and as you referred to our guidance of we think it's going to be 20%, 25% growth. And keep in mind, we're lapping an 18% decline in organic sales growth from the prior period. We think that growth is driven by both recovering from cyber as well as the strength of our demand plans. Now as I mentioned, that will be partially offset by increased trade spending. In this normalized environment, we're now lapping a period in front half of last year, when we were at a depressed level of merchandising support because of the out of stocks. And so you'll see good strong top-line growth modestly offset by increased trade spending in the front half of the year, which will depress it a bit. And then, as you get to the back half of the year, we average about a normalized level of spending in the back half of '24. I wouldn't expect much of a price mix impact year-over-year in the back half, but a little bit more pronounced in the front half. Chris Carey : And just, regarding that back half volume expectation, shaking out around mid-single-digits, do you see it the same way and just confidence around that number in this environment? And then, if I could sneak in, the deceleration that you're expecting in the Q1 gross margin relative to Q4 is quite atypical. I know you're talking about negative mix or positive mix in your fiscal Q4, but I understand charcoal also should have been a detriment. Why such a steep quarter-over-quarter decline? Is it all mix or is manufacturing coming off? Any context there would be helpful. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, sure. On the gross margin lines, you talked about sequentially going from Q4 to Q1. As we said, we think we're going to have a good solid quarter in Q1 up 400 basis points to 500 basis points, but that will be lower than what we landed Q4. Part of it is what I mentioned. The reason we over delivered Q4 is because of this BU mix. We just sold less household products relative to the rest of our portfolio. We don't expect that to be the case in Q1. We expect those businesses to continue to recover and take a larger portion of our sales in Q1, so you won't get that that temporary benefit. And then in addition to that, I talked about the trade spending. You'll have a bit more of a trade spending drag in Q1. And then lastly, some of it is just based on our cost savings timing. We have hundreds of cost savings projects that have natural timelines and so those play out over the course of the year. I'm not particularly too concerned about how it plays out in any given quarter as long as we deliver good strong cost savings for the year, which we expect to do, but that'll have some impact on quarters as well. Chris Carey : Just regarding the back half confidence, if that mid-single number is where you're kind of thinking and that's it for me. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. On the 3% to 5% organic sales growth, yes, our expectation will have good strong growth in the back half as well for both volume and sales. When you think about our sales of 3% to 5%, we expect this to primarily come from growing volume and growing share and we expect it to happen both in the front and back half of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Bonnie Herzog : I had a quick follow-up on Litter. Linda, you mentioned more work to do and mentioned strong innovation you have. So could you maybe touch on some of that for us? And then whether there is more innovation planned to be rolled out in FY'25? Also, could you give us a sense of the magnitude of increased spend levels you'll need to win these consumers back? I guess, maybe just a big picture on trade spend and promos, how big of a risk you see for spend levels to go beyond what you're factoring into guidance? I guess I'm asking, given the retail and consumer environment. Linda Rendle : Sure. On Litter just a bit more. First on the innovation side that you touched on, we do have strong plans. First I would say that we're going to double down on some of the very successful platforms that we've had that are very value focused, like Outstretch, which we've talked about before, which is a more concentrated Litter and has performed really well in the market, as particularly consumers are looking for more value having to change that Litter box less, is a very high value for them. We'll double down on those and we have new innovations coming, which I can't give any details yet, but plan for the back half of our fiscal year '25 in the Litter category. We're also looking at claims, and ensuring that we have the right messaging from an advertising perspective. When it comes to investment particularly on Litter, and then I'll speak more broadly to your point on promotion and spend levels in aggregate. In Litter, we contemplated that in our outlook. That is embedded in the assumption that we have 11% to 11.5% of advertising and sales promotion as percent of sales. And then as Kevin just highlighted, the fact that we have increased trade promotion dollars in the system. And so Litter is accounted for that. And then that is the truth for the enterprise as well. We've accounted for the fact that, we're going to keep the spend level about what it was for advertising and sales promotion as a percent of sales versus last year. We think that's a prudent assumption and allows us to continue that momentum with consumers and talking about the value we offer and new innovation. And then same on the trade promotion piece. We have assumed that in our outlook. We've assumed the environment will be about what it was pre-COVID. The risk of that going higher, as what we've seen today, it's been pretty rational and we're seeing retailers be pretty rational. They're definitely ramping up promotion as we expected, but we're not seeing anything that sends us a signal that we haven't made a good assumption. It will be something Bonnie we watch throughout the year though. That certainly is a variable in the plan and could impact it. But for now, I think what people are looking at is using promotion in the right way to ensure that, we're communicating value, that we're introducing innovation, and using that in a very positive way. And we'll be watching it closely and we will react, if we see something from competition. But again, we see a pretty rational environment, pockets of things in Glad, Litter that we're dealing with but we've contemplated all about in the outlook. Bonnie Herzog : And maybe just a quick second question on your EBIT margin. It's still below historical levels. In the context of everything you just mentioned, how should we think about further recovery and essentially ultimately seeing when they could reach historical levels? And I guess, I'm asking the context of, again, everything you just mentioned, Linda, as well as gross margins becoming less of a tailwind moving forward and then certainly A&P investments and the increase and the expectations there? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. Bonnie, on EBIT margin, I'd say I feel like we're making very good progress. And then I'll talk adjusted EBIT margin that factors out some of these one-time charges. But if you look at our history, back in fiscal year '22, when we had the significant inflation, our adjusted EBIT margin is about 12%. Last year, we built that back up to about 15%. And if you look at our plans this year, it gets us back to about 17% to 17.5%. We're getting pretty close to fully rebuilding EBIT margin, historical levels about 18%. Our expectation is, by the end of this year we're very close to that level. And then going forward, it's the same things we talked about is continued to drive our margin transformation efforts, continue to drive the top line. We think that's how we get there. And then the very good work we've done on the streamlined operating model, we completed that program. We're on track to deliver $100 million and as we've talked, our intent to start moving our admin spending closer to 13% of sales over time and that will certainly be a contributing element as well. I feel very good about the progress we've made over the last several years, including what we intend to do this year, but I think that work continues beyond. But I have every confidence we'll fully rebuild EBIT margin as well. Operator : Your next question will come from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : I just wanted to follow-up on the 3% to 5% org sales outlook for fiscal '25. Can you just give us some clarity on the volume versus pricing mix that's embedded in guidance? It sounded like in prepared remarks you do assume some pricing, which surprised me but maybe that's international. Just the balance there and specifically what's driving the pricing would be helpful. Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, as it relates to our 3% to 5% goal, that will come from volume growing slightly above 3% to 5%. And then our expectation for price mix is modestly negative, and that's primarily driven by this increased trade spending I talked about in the front half of the year to get back to a more normalized level of merchandising support. We don't have any meaningful pricing in the plan for fiscal year '25. We'll do a little bit internationally, but that won't have a ceding impact on the top line. It will be primarily coming from volume with a very modest offset in price mix. Dara Mohsenian : And then just, Linda, with the divestiture of Argentina and sale of VMS here, could you just address the 3% to 5% long-term organic sales growth outlook. Does that still hold? Presumably, it still does, but just give us some insight into how you think about the building blocks there, particularly given the recent divestitures? Linda Rendle : Yes. It does. It's one of the steps that we take to ensure our financial algorithm is in a good spot. We're committed to continuing to evolve the portfolio in Argentina and VMS are great examples to ensure that we have businesses that are less volatile in the case of Argentina and businesses that we feel can deliver the consistent and profitable growth that we need to, and that really comes down to our decision on VMS. Both of those support a more stable, consistent sales growth. Both of them support margin expansion, as Kevin covered and a more profitable business overall. Obviously, that will have an impact to reported sales this year. But if you look at organic, it's pretty strong. And then as we move forward, what I think it really allows us to do is, focus on the places where we have growth opportunities. It allows us to focus in places like Litter, where I said we have more work to do, in other parts of the business, like international that has grown above our sales average. PPD, which we feel confident now is returning to a stronger grower in the portfolio. So that really in the future as we look to '25 and beyond, not only does that create a new base to grow from that is stronger, but it also allows us to focus on the opportunities in front of us. Operator : Our next question will come from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Kaumil Gajrawala : On advertising, I saw in this quarter it was at about 14% of sales. Is that just a little bit of maybe a step-up in spend as you got one into the end of the year, just setting you up for next year? Is there something else going on? Linda Rendle : Yes. Kaumil, obviously, fiscal year '24 was pretty dynamic, and we set out to have a higher level of spending to support what we thought would be a more value conscious consumer. And then after the cyber-attack in August, we tried to pull back as much spending as we could as we had out of stocks in the market and we backloaded a lot of that plan as we came back into full distribution, as we were able to merchandise again, as we fully rebuilt supply and that 14% represents getting all of those things back in the market and wanting a strong start from a consumer momentum perspective. As you saw for '25, we're returning back to that level of 11%, 11.5%, which is consistent with what we did in aggregate last year. But I think from a Q4 perspective, it just supported all of those fundamentals being live and back in the market and a strong start to the momentum that we intend to continue to build in '25. Kaumil Gajrawala : And then on promotional activity, but in the context of thinking about gross margins and promo activity, is the assumption that the levels that we're at right now in terms of train spend and promo is where we're sort of leveling off? Or is there an assumption, that it's going to continue to climb over the course of the next calendar year and that 100 bps of gross margin expansion incorporates the likelihood of promos increasing still? Kevin Jacobsen : Kaumil, the way I'd say it is, if you look at the back half of our fiscal year '24, we merchandise about 25% of our sales and that's very consistent sort of normal merchandising activity. But as I mentioned, in the front half of '24, it was depressed because of the cyber event. As you fast forward to fiscal year '25, you should see a year-over-year increase in trade spending in the front half of the year because we've got to lap that depressed level. But in the back half of fiscal year '25, we're about at the level we think is appropriate and I wouldn't expect a year-over-year increase. You'll see a little bit of a drag on sales and margin in the front half of fiscal year '25 as we get back to that normalized level and I would not expect to see much of that in the back half of fiscal year '25. Operator : Our next question will come from Kevin Grundy with BNP Paribas. Kevin Grundy : Question on advertising and marketing as well. A little bit of a different angle, though. Was there any consideration to maybe leaning in a bit and reinvesting more of this gross margin improvement? You're calling for a 100 basis points of GM improvement. Advertising and marketing up. But I guess I'm asking this one in the context of number one, the market share probably not where you'd hope it would be. And if we're looking at the Nielsen data sort of as a proxy, it seems like there's a lot of share loss beyond household. We're seeing share gains in Hidden Valley and Wipes. Beyond that, at least in the Nielsen data, there's quite a bit of share loss. I'd add to that, we're seeing advertising and marketing trade promo go up across the board. So sort of given the gross margin improvement, share probably not where you want it to be is it prudent just to kind of push back, respectfully push back a little bit to maintain advertising and marketing. Wouldn't this seem like the right time to get the market shares back to where you want them by leaning in even more in this environment, where it's going up across the board from the competitors and your market share is not quite where you want it to be. It'd be great to get your thoughts on that. Linda Rendle : Yes, Kevin. As you can imagine for '25, we look at a number of scenarios on what the right level of spend was on advertising on promotion. And our general managers, we pushed them to say, are there incremental spending opportunities that are good, decent short-term payout but would contribute long-term even more. And what they came back with was that 11% to 11.5% range that we had. We think that strikes the right balance. Here's maybe just a little bit of thinking about what you're seeing in share and what we expect and why we're comfortable with the 11% to 11.5%. If you look at share for the extra rate of what we had in June, less than three quarters of recovering from a pretty major cyber events where our distribution, et cetera our distribution was down a third. We lost five full share points. We ended June down three-tenths of a point in share in aggregate. I don't love being down in share, but I think that speaks to the power of the plans, our execution and our brands. To be clear, we intend to grow share in fiscal year '25. But what we're seeing is, just as we restored distribution, which happened mostly in May and June, we haven't even had a full purchase cycle with the consumer yet, which is about 90 days on average. What we're seeing is household penetration begin to rebound. It's not exactly where we want it to be right now, but generally things are all moving in the right direction. And that spend of 11.5% and the increased promotional spend we think is prudent based off of that. I'll be clear though, if the year starts to play out differently and we are not seeing what we expect from our businesses share improve, we feel absolutely comfortable coming back and saying, we need to spend more. And I know I think that would be met positively. But what we're trying to balance right now is top-line growth, ensuring that we have the fuel by expanding margins. We think we have that balance right, right now. And as I've said time and time again, we are not afraid to spend just like we did 14% in Q4 if we feel it's the right thing to do for the business for the long-term. Operator : And we'll move next to Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Robert Moskow : Hi, thanks for the question. I guess we can wait for the 10-K, but can you give us a kind of a snapshot on how cash flow ended for the year? It was down for the first three quarters, but wanted to know if there's any kind of recovery in fourth. And then, how should we look at fiscal '25? Is it kind of a -- can we take the net income and kind of just add D&A and subtract CapEx? Or are there any kind of cash expenses that will really hit it or working capital changes that we should be aware of? Kevin Jacobsen : Sure, Robert. Happy to answer that on free cash flow. Just to remind folks, we target free cash flow as percent of sales 11% to 13%. If you look at free cash flow, it mirrors very similar to what we're doing on the P&L in terms of rebuilding gross margins profitability. If I go back to fiscal year '22, we had about 8% free cash flow. So inflation, depressing margin, depressing profit, we were well below our targeted 11% to 13%. If you look at the last two years, we've averaged about 10%. There are some timing issues on tax payments, but if you take that noise out for fiscal year in '23 and '24 about 10%. This year, fiscal year '25, as we continue to rebuild margin and profitability, we're targeting about 12% free cash flow as percent of sales, so very much back in line with our targeted growth rate. And as a result of that, I think you folks have seen we continue to support the dividend, but we're also starting to pull cash-up on the balance sheet. So we have restarted our share repurchase program. We started this year that we've had suspended for about the last three years and that's really a function of really rebuilding the balance sheet, rebuilding cash flow and now we're able to start deploying that cash back to shareholders. Robert Moskow : Where does that stand in your priorities for how to return cash to shareholders? Would there be a step-up in fiscal '25 or does it depend on other factors? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes. In terms of priorities, it's our lowest priority. So job one for us is to invest in the base business and we'll continue to make sure every opportunity we have to invest in the business that generates value for shareholders, we'll continue to do that. We have a very robust plan of investment this year, but in spite of that we support the dividend. Additionally, we have our debt to EBITDA. You folks may know we target 2x to 2.5x. This year, we're looking to be at the very low end of that range, so we're in a very good place from a leverage ratio. And then our last priority, if we have excess cash on the balance sheet, we're going to return that to shareholders and that's the position we find ourselves in this year. We started that process. I'd say for now we're targeting $250 million to $300 million to return. That's primarily catching up on dilution, as we've been out of the market for the last several years. But we'll evaluate that as we get through the year and see how things shake out, but we think this is a good place to start in terms of our outlook. Operator : And your next question comes from Javier Escalante with Evercore ISI. Just one moment, please. Then it looks like his line has disconnected. We'll move to our next caller, Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Olivia Tong : I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the margin improvement from this year, not just this quarter, because relative to your goals going into the year at this time last year, sales came in below but earnings actually was a fair bit above despite, arguably, consumer challenges building over the course of the neck the last 12 months. Putting cyber aside, would love to hear a little bit about the key drivers of the earnings improvement from this year. Kevin Jacobsen : In regard to I think you mentioned gross margin primarily. If you look at gross margin, what drove the roughly 360 basis points of improvement? For us, it was another very good year of cost savings, and I really credit our team in spite of the cyber disruption, folks stayed very focused on delivering the productivity improvements that we're counting on. And so we delivered 180 basis points of gross margin expansion through cost savings. That was a very good year for us. We also had pricing primarily in international markets, and that was really Argentina prior to the divestiture, but that certainly contributed to gross margin expansion as well. And then lastly, I'd just say, we've moved into a commodity environment that's fairly benign. If you look at commodities, we've been dealing with tremendous amount of inflation the previous two years. This year is essentially flat, we had no real commodity drag and you had all the benefits of cost savings and the pricing actions we took flowing through to the bottom line. Those are really the primary drivers. Olivia Tong : I was more sort of thinking about what came in as a surprise to you. It sounds like it's primarily the cost savings. But then the other thing that I wanted to know about is, one of the things that we're hearing during this earning season is about improving household penetration, especially given the backdrop. Can you discuss some of the things that you're doing to improve your household penetration, whether through promotion and trade spend or some of the digital investments that you're making to try and set out where there are potentially more pockets of consumers that you may be underserving? Linda Rendle : Sure. Maybe I'll just close the point on margin, Olivia that you made. Kevin certainly outlined exactly what happened. I think what I would just note is, our continued confidence in the overall margin transformation program we put in place, that's leading to this type of sustained increase in cost savings. We're pulling levers that we pulled before in new ways and we have completely different capabilities that we've built, as well and we're enforcing that by investing in our digital transformation, so better access to data and insights and allowing us to move quicker. I think that's really what we've been pleased to see as it's played out. We have increased confidence and obviously giving us confidence to return to pre-pandemic gross margins, which if you look at the last few years, that's a significant feat given what we had experienced from a commodity increase perspective and overall inflation. That's what I would call out as we continue to get more and more confident about that and it gives us confidence in fiscal year '25 to return to those margins. And I think to Kevin's earlier point that gives us the flexibility to invest if we need to. We feel like we have the right investment levels now, but given the fact that we've made such strong progress there, if we need to invest more, we are ready to do that. And then your point on household penetration, as the industry took pricing, one of the trade-offs we always know that happen at a time when you take pricing is you trade-off household penetration and usually that's temporary. And that happens for a number of reasons. Consumers, you have elasticity and elasticity plays out in a number of ways. Consumers leave the category, consumers decide to behave differently within the category, they make substitute, they have longer purchase cycles, et cetera. And then as you see pricing roll through, you see consumers naturally come back, because they find their alternatives didn't work or they go through all of their pantry. We'd expect to see that happen naturally. But then the work that we're doing is really focused on ensuring that, we are focused on superior value, that we offer them a value that when they go and they're choosing their household essentials that they return to the category and they return to Clorox Brands. And we're seeing that, over the last couple of quarters with some improvements in household penetration. We would expect to see that continue and support the volume driven growth that we'll have in fiscal year '25. But there's a combination of things that we think about in this. Superiority is a combination of pricing, the brand and the product experience. We are ensuring that we have the right price points, which we feel good about. And as I've said before, we continue to look through our net revenue management work to ensure that price points and price gaps are where they need to be. They largely are, but we will absolutely take on if we see a place where our price gaps aren't where they need to be and we'll do that work to ensure that we have that. And we'll use things like price pack architecture to deliver even additional value to those consumers, who may have exited and need a different pack size or buying in a different channel. And then, if you think about product, that's where really innovation and focusing on claims matters. We had a strong innovation program this year. But what I would just emphasize is the last few years, we've had a number as the world has, but I think in particular if you think about Clorox, a number of operational disruptions outside of our control. And we've been trying to balance both margin, earnings, top-line and I think we've done a good job at that. But the organization now is really focused on returning maniacally to growth, given our confidence in margin rebuilding, given our confidence in the brands. And so we are really focused on where is our product need or boost from claims perspective. We are -- pretty innovating. How can we make our innovation even bigger and how can we bring to life those platforms that we intend to launch. And I'll give you maybe just an example of one that doesn't feel like a big deal, but is actually having really an impact in the marketplace, and that's Clorox Scentiva. We launched that a number of years ago. It was very successful. And I talked about in CAGNY that we were going to relaunch Scentiva. And we did that with better claims, better scent profiles and we've actually had the largest quarter in Q4 on Scentiva that we've ever had. A good example where the team is getting laser-focused on value and we're bringing in consumers who maybe can't afford anymore to buy a cleaner and an air freshener and they're getting a great value by having an all in one product with Clorox Scentiva. Good examples of where by category we're being pretty maniacal about that. And then finally, investment. As I've said, I feel like we have the right level of investment on [ANSP] and promo to do exactly that making sure we're capturing consumers at back to school, during times when their family gets ill, reminding them what we can do to keep them safe as well as talking about the trust of the brands and the promises that we deliver. All of that adds up to growing household penetration over time. That's what the team is focused on is, how do we return them to the levels that we were at before and grow them from there, and that it will be part of how we grow share in fiscal year '25. Operator : And we'll move to our next question that comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Linda, I mean your last answer gave a lot of color on this, but the implied market share gain, I think is very significant. I hear you on the kind of trend line and where you've gotten back to and more or less flattish. But talking about volume growth north of three to five in a category backdrop that you've described as challenged, resilient but challenged consumer just feels like a really big push. I guess number one, would be why start out with such a high bar? Because again like mid-single-digits volume is a big number and it just yes -- I'll leave it there as my first question. Linda Rendle : Sure, Lauren. I think first, one thing to keep in mind as we go through the quarters is we have the lap of cyber. And so we lost five points of share if you look at the height of the cyber tech. And we are regaining a lot of that volume in Q1 and gaining a lot of that share. If you think about exactly what you said, Lauren, the exit rate close to flattish in June. But you have to even if you just forecast getting back to flattish for an entire year, that is a significant amount of volume growth. Then growing share modestly on top of that gets you to that number. I think that's part of what's going on as you have a dynamic of lapping being out of stock, significant volume growth there, significant share loss and refilling that and then growing share modestly, what we would assume in the back half. And some categories will grow faster than others. But we assume the vast majority of our major categories we will see share improvement in and we feel like we have the plans to do that. Lauren Lieberman : And then if I can just follow-up on some gross margin components. Kevin, you've been super clear that mix is a big contributor this quarter. I just want to clarify, was that in that logistics and manufacturing line? And if you could give any guardrails for like roughly how big it was just when we think about next year's comparison? And then also commodities for fiscal 2025 kind of flattish or is that expected to be a benefit? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, Lauren. On gross margin drivers, you're right. It shows up in the manufacturing line. So when you have mix between business units, and if you saw in our rec we provided. We're favorable about 200 basis points in Q4 and a good portion of that was driven by that favorable BU mix, which I wouldn't expect to continue as move into fiscal year 2025. In regard to commodities, if you look at our outlook for fiscal year 2025, our expectation is about $75 million of total supply chain inflation and we think about half of that will come through commodities and then the other half will come through the other aspects of the supply chain. And so, for us, roughly $35 million, $40 million of commodity inflation this year is a very modest amount of commodity inflation. That's what we're expecting the outlook. Operator : And we'll go next to Anna Lizzul with Bank of America Global Research. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is [John Kiefour] on the line for Anna. Just a very quick question on the digital transformation you guys outlined in the prepared remarks. You mentioned Canada seems to be relatively finished. Just wondering how far you guys expect to get through the remainder of the program by the end of this year? Have you seen that like realistically, can you give us any kind of size about how much of the benefits have flowed through? And I guess what you guys are expecting in terms of the cadence from that benefit to flow through overall? Linda Rendle : Yes. The digital transformation, we're really pleased with our first wave of our ERP and global finance, rollout that happened on July 1st went very well and gave us strong confidence that, we have set up that wave to learn when we do the new U.S. coming up next year. And so, we have been maniacal about documenting everything that we've learned to set us up for the biggest transition that we have coming on that ERP portion. And as what you saw, we've talked about the fact that, that was delayed due to the cyber event. But we're still on track to finish the program, in fiscal year '26. And we'll make again strong progress this year on the ERP. Next year, the U.S. will come online, and we have additional capabilities coming online as well. We were able to reshuffle some things so that we end the program about the same time. We have seen some value, as you think about the overall digital transformation we have in place as we put our data lake in place, you saw that through things like our marketing efficiencies that we've already had early results on but the bulk of the value that we get and this is a very strong return on investment project comes in '26 and beyond as we complete the implementation of the ERP. Operator : And our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : I know we're running longs, but a couple of questions if I could on that 3% to 5% top-line goal for next year. I guess maybe this gets a little bit at what Lauren was asking about, but is there a way to think about how that compares to the assumed rate of consumption growth in fiscal 2025? I'd expect maybe a couple of points at least of net distribution gains contributing to shipments. So maybe assume consumption running below 3% to 5%, but just wanted to clarify and hopefully quantify that gap. And then as you're talking about it, if we think about it across the segments and just talk about segment variability relative to that goal, are each of the segments expected to run essentially within that range? Or do you see room for some -- any to run notably ahead or below? It seems to me like household and international candidates to run modestly ahead for different reasons, but I just want to play that back for your reaction. Linda Rendle : 3% to 5%, this is a complicated set of factors to talk through, given each quarter is a little bit different. But Steve, I think to your point, some of that 3% to 5% is rebuilding, against when we were out of stock in Q1 and Q2. And remember, like you said, we didn't fully restore distribution and merchandising until Q4. You're going to have all of those impacts of that lap, in place. And our categories, we're expecting the low end of low single-digits right now. But we have categories that aren't tracked. And I would just help you keep that in mind too. We have international, we have our professional business that are not in those numbers and we would expect higher exposure to growth in those categories. We've seen that continue to play out and we have get more and more confidence in that, as they've delivered over the last couple of quarters. And then of course, we talked about for share. We won't expect many of our categories to be in the 3% to 5% range. We would expect them to be in low single-digits and then we'll perform slightly better than that. But you do have that lap effect that is certainly playing a role. And then on the segments, what I'd call out is our segments all do have different nuances on performing, call it international is a good example of one that has been a strong growth for us and we'd expect that to continue. And now that we've actually mostly eliminated most of the volatility that we had on FX due to the sale of Argentina, that will be more consistent as well. Our health and wellness segment has continued to perform well. We continue to see share growth opportunities there. Our professional business is back on track, so feeling good there. And then to the point that you made on household, we have maybe an easier comp as you look through the year, given it took longer to fill distribution and we didn't meet expectations on that business in Q4. I think you'll see some variability, but, not outside of the range of the normal variability you would see in our segments. Steve Powers : And then if I could, Kevin, you may not want to go here, but I'm going to try anyway. Just you mentioned the structural benefits from the portfolio reshaping, the exit of Argentina VMS, those benefits of margins. I'm wondering if you could give us some kind of quantification or order of magnitude as to how material that is, as you think about the margins that margin improvement is embedded in the '25 guidance? Kevin Jacobsen : Yes, Steve, I appreciate the framing of your question. As Linda and I both said, exiting both those businesses, if you think about what we're trying to accomplish in our Ignite strategy, our financial goal is more consistent profitable growth. Those businesses were both dilutive, dilutive to the top line growth rate, dilutive to growth margin and profitability. And so we're exiting both of those businesses. You will see structural improvement. From a top-line perspective, it's probably less than half a point, but it'll structurally improve the growth rates of this company from the top line. And then, from a margin as well, you probably get in that 50 bps to 70 bps structural improvement gross margins once we get both these businesses exited. To me, it is a very nice adjustment to our portfolio to make sure that, we're doing exactly what we committed to more consistency and more profitable growth. And we think exiting both those businesses, while not easy decisions certainly support that endeavor. Steve Powers : You appreciate the framing. I appreciate the answer. Operator : Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Evercore ISI. Javier Escalante : I have no clue what happened, so let's see whether it works this time around. I would like to tackle the household business slightly different. When you step back, it's rare when you see negative pricing and negative volume at the same time? And I know that you spoke a lot about promotional activity, but to what extent the volumes are telling you is that you took too much pricing? And I have a follow-up. Linda Rendle : I'm glad you're back online, Javier. So in household, here's how I would look at it. Certainly, as I said, it didn't meet our expectations. Very clear on why for both for all grilling, Glad and Litter. And it's exactly what I highlighted for grilling. We didn't see any extraordinary merchandising in that category. It was exactly what we expected it to be, but volumes were down due to weather. For Glad, what's going on that you have there is, we were out of the large size market for quite a while. So you have some dynamics on pricing and mix that are happening within that business, until you fully restore supply. I'd say the same thing for Litter. But Litter was a much heavier promotional environment than we would even see as normal as we had expected it to be and we certainly contributed to that as we were looking to get subscriptions back, etcetera. What we see though again is a more rational environment as we move forward back to pre-COVID levels from a pricing perspective. If I look at our value, for Glad, again, we ended the quarter down two-tenths of a point. That would say that our pricing is holding up well in the marketplace. And as we return large sizes, that's the value consumers are looking for. If they might have switched due to price promotion before now that we have the items they want in the market, I would continue to believe that they'll choose us, and evidence of that is the fact that we did so well on Prime Day and we're back to growing share in Glad Trash and our largest customer. And then for Litter, I think again that one's going to take a little bit longer. That is a category we see a decent level of price promotion in. We've accounted for that in our outlook. We would expect to continue to be competitive. But I don't feel like we're in a place where our price gaps are out of whack. It's simply that people are looking to drive against a value-oriented consumer. They want to win share in a more value-oriented marketplace. And again, I think for grilling as we go forward, merchandising plays an important role. Our price gaps look generally in line. Our shares held up. We were down three-tenths of a share point in June. Feel good about where we were despite a bad grilling category season, and feel like if we need to make any adjustments to pricing, like I highlighted earlier, I'm not sure, Javier, when you joined back in the call. But if we need to make any adjustments on an item basis, we absolutely have that plan right now and we won't be afraid to do it as we go through the course of the year. But largely, in aggregate, our pricing is working and holding in the market. Javier Escalante : And then the second question has to do with A&P spending or marketing spending. And one particular business that looks very weak in [Circana data] that includes Ulta as well and Amazon and Burt's Bees. So the brand has been weak for a long period of time. It goes through channels that are not compatible or not the same of the balance of the portfolio. And you compete with companies that spend multiples of 14% in marketing, like over 30%. The question is, as you review the portfolio, do you think that you are competitive in Burt's Bees or you will consider adjustments? Linda Rendle : Burt's has been an acquisition for us over the years that we've been really pleased about. It's been in a faster growing category and Burt's has contributed stronger sales growth, if you just look in the aggregate, year after year given the opportunities in the natural personal care segment and the attractiveness of those categories. And we don't compete really with some of these large multibillion dollar beauty brands. And we compete in a segment where consumers are looking for products that come from nature, that offer that promise. I mean, although that set is quite competitive, they're not competing with some of the bigger brands that you might think of. And we're really a food drug mass type of business and we were built for that. Our pricing, our architecture is built for that, et cetera. I feel very confident in Burt's future. I'd say, right now, if you look at what Burt's has gone through, unfortunately, last year, we had a massive supply issue when we had a supplier have a fire that put lip tube availability significantly at risk. And then, of course, Burt's had the compounding effect that all of our businesses had of the cyber-attack. What you're seeing is some variability in distribution, et cetera. But if I look at the long-term health and opportunities in front of Burt, I see that as being an opportunities for it to continue to be growth accretive to the company. We're laser focused on making sure that as we have restored supply, we're getting that distribution back. We're also rationalizing distribution in some of the categories. I don't think it makes sense for us to compete in and I think that's just good portfolio management. But Burt's categories are attractive. We have a very strong brand that consumers love and I feel very confident about it moving forward. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle, I would now like to turn the program back to you. Linda Rendle : Thanks. To close out today's call, I'd like to revisit our long-term strategy and reflect on our transformation journey. Ignite was created to accelerate profitable growth, to create long-term shareholder value. As part of that goal, we set on a course to fundamentally strengthen our value creation model, including how we generate the fuel necessary to drive growth. We're innovating with clear intention. We're focused on delivering superior value through brands consumers love. We're creating a consumer obsessed, faster and leaner organization by reimagining how we work, enabling our team with data and technology, streamlining our operating model, evolving our portfolio to reduce volatility and driving more profitable long term growth. Our strategy has guided us well over the past five years, but we've had to adjust our execution based on several factors outside of our control. We've gone through periods where we saw massive demand increases during COVID-19, normalization of demand, unprecedented inflation, multiple rounds of pricing, a cyber-attack, and the global macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty and volatility that persist today. These shocks have caused our performance to be more volatile. At the same time, they've also led to the acceleration of our transformation agenda. We've been purposeful and balanced on our actions, leaning on our strategy to execute through every challenge, staying committed to rebuilding our margin and earnings, while maintaining top-line growth. This is positioning us to fully restore margin in fiscal year 2025 and deliver strong free cash flow in line with our long-term goals, while investing strongly in our brands. I'm confident we're taking all the right steps, some of which add value now and others will bear fruit as we advance the choices further. We have consistently said that this would not be linear given the environment and challenges, but we continue to make strong progress and remain confident that we're on the right track. Through it all, we stayed true to our goal to transform Clorox into a stronger company poised to deliver more consistent profitable growth and enhance long-term shareholder value. Thank you for your time and questions. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress against our transformation agenda next quarter. Take care.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to The Clorox Company Quarterly and Fiscal Year Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference. Lisah Burhan : Thank you, Jen. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Linda Rendle, our Chair and CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. I hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. In just a moment, Linda will share a few opening comments and then we\u2019ll take your questions. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, including about our fiscal 2025 outlook. These statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations, but may differ from actual results or outcomes. In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statement section, which identifies various factors that could affect any such forward-looking statements, which have been filed with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the non-GAAP financial information section of our earnings release and the Supplemental Financial Schedule in the Investor Relations section of our website for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Linda. Linda Rendle : Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our first quarter results were strong. Taking a step back, we entered fiscal 2025 in a position of operational strength, having fully restored supply, distribution and the vast majority of market share from the August 2023 cyberattack. This quarter, we drove further progress as we fully restored overall market share, grew share in most of our categories and delivered results above our expectations, while continuing to make progress against our strategy for long-term value creation. Importantly, we continued to deliver on our commitment to rebuild margin, achieving our eighth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. Our holistic margin management capabilities continue to enhance our ability to fuel growth and we remain on track to return to pre-pandemic gross margins this fiscal year while investing in our business. We also completed the development of our VMS business during the quarter. This follows the previous sale of our Argentina business and marks another important milestone in the evolution of our portfolio, which supports our goal to reduce volatility and drive more consistent and profitable growth over time. Looking ahead, we continue to see an uncertain macro environment where consumers remain under pressure and continue to seek value. Within this context, and in the complexity of the recent years, our portfolio of trusted brands in everyday essential categories has remained strong and resilient. So during a time when it matters most, we are focused on delivering superior value to consumers and continuing to invest in our brands and innovation to win in the market. We have strong fundamentals in place and we remain laser-focused on advancing our transformation to be a stronger and more resilient company. Through these actions, we\u2019re making good progress in building a more consumer-obsessed, faster and leaner company that\u2019s well-positioned to deliver consistent and profitable growth. With that, Kevin and I will take your questions. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Rendle. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Dara Mohsenian. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. So I just wanted to touch on market share. You mentioned in the release that you guys have fully restored market share. As you look out from here, do you think you can consistently expand share, maybe talk about some of the key drivers behind that? And then specifically, if you could talk about the back half of the year, what are you assuming there in terms of your market share performance and volume growth? I\u2019m guessing maybe you\u2019re not assuming much in the back half of the year, so some short-term clarity there and thoughts on long-term share potential from here and how you drive it? Linda Rendle : Sure, Dara. I\u2019ll cover that, maybe just starting with the performance in Q1. We did indeed return our overall market share to its pre-cyber levels and we saw growth in almost every one of our categories. And I think it\u2019s important to note that that growth came before we began lapping the cyber disruption as well, so our overall market share was up in that period before we started the lap. We\u2019re also seeing, just from a private label perspective, not really a significant change in what we saw in previous quarters where private label share has been normalized coming out of the peak when they grew share during cyber. So if you look at aggregates, they only grew share in two of our categories and we also grew share in those same categories. And they\u2019re actually down versus pre-cyber levels, if you look at this quarter, compared to the quarter before we had the attack. So we feel great about where our share position is. Obviously, we\u2019ve invested more in both advertising and sales promotion and trade promotion to ensure that we have the health of our brands covered. I would say that\u2019s generally in line with what we thought we were going to see. So the share growth that we experienced this quarter was in line with our expectations. Moving forward, we would expect to continue to grow share, albeit probably at a smaller level than we\u2019ve seen given we\u2019re in a lap period right now. So that share growth will be lumpy throughout the year, but we do expect the end of fiscal year with solid share growth and overall market share gains. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. And within that, can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing from a promotional environment perspective in the industry and maybe parse out some of the different business segments in terms of what you\u2019re seeing there? Thanks. Linda Rendle : Yeah. Our assumption for this year was that promo would return to pre-COVID levels and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve seen. I would say some categories are slightly ahead of that, some are below, maybe the one that I think is probably the biggest variance versus pre-COVID and pre-cyber would be Litter. Litter\u2019s promotional levels are significantly higher. And to be fair, we\u2019re driving a lot of that as we work to get our business back with consumers and we\u2019ve talked about those dynamics being a little different in that category than others. We view that as temporary though, and we would say over time, we would restore that back to regular merchandising levels as we reestablish our share. But overall, we\u2019re seeing generally in line with what we expected returning to pre-COVID levels. Again, each category a little bit different, but on average, other than Litter, I wouldn\u2019t call it anything that is materially different one way or the other. Dara Mohsenian : Great. Thank you. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Dara. Operator : And our next question will come from Peter Grom with UBS. Peter Grom : Thanks, Operator. Good afternoon, everyone. Hope you\u2019re doing well. I kind of wanted to follow up on Dara\u2019s line of questioning there and just kind of ask around the phasing of the sales guidance. Yeah, obviously, once you came better, some of that\u2019s coming out of the second quarter. I guess what I\u2019m trying to understand is just, given what we\u2019re seeing from many of your peers, talking about weaker category growth, a lot of them are delivering organic sales below their respective algorithms. Your guidance seems to kind of still imply solid growth in the back half of the year. So just kind of curious as to whether your expectations for organic growth in the back half of the year have evolved at all just given the current environment? Kevin Jacobsen : Hey, Peter. This is Kevin. Yeah. Happy to take that one as it relates to the phasing of sales. Obviously, as you folks saw, we had a good solid start to the year, 31% organic growth. I think you probably saw in our prepared remarks, we have adjusted Q2 a bit as some of that performance in Q1 was pulling forward volume we thought was going to ship in Q2. So we made some adjustment there and we\u2019re now expecting Q2 to be down probably in the low-teens. And then if you consider that front half, what that would suggest in the back half of the year is, if you take the middle of our outlook that 4% or so for the full year, you\u2019re growing probably 3% to 5% in the back half a year. So right in line with our long-term algorithm. I think your other question is kind of getting out what are those drivers that\u2019s supporting that 3% to 5% growth? And you remember, Peter, we called back in August that we expected the categories to slow and that sort of flat to 1%. That continues to be our expectation. Also keep in mind though, for about 20% of our business are International or Clorox Professional businesses continue to perform quite well. We continue to expect those businesses to grow in the mid-single digits. So they\u2019re nice contributors to our growth. We\u2019ve also got the benefit of our divestitures. We didn\u2019t fully see that in Q1 because we just sold our VMS business late in the quarter, but you\u2019ll get the full structural benefit to the topline starting in Q2 and that will certainly benefit the back half as well. And then as Linda was referring to earlier, just the strength of our overall demand plans. We\u2019ve got a good innovation program lined up for the back half and we certainly got strong marketing support. So overall feel very good about the drivers of how we think we\u2019ll get to that 3% to 5%. And I think why that\u2019s important is, because I think you folks know we\u2019re, not only about us delivering 3% to 5% this year, but we\u2019re spending quite a bit of time ensuring that we can continue to deliver 3% to 5% as we head into fiscal year 2026. So I really like the exit rate we\u2019re focused on to make sure that we\u2019ve got a good plan in place as we move forward. Peter Grom : Great. And then just maybe a quick follow up on gross margin. So just the first quarter, it came in well ahead of your guidance. Was that entirely related to the better, fixed cost absorption related to the shipments or were there other drivers that kind of led to the upside in the quarter? Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. It was really driven by the over delivery in the topline that just flowed through to better cost absorption, which also benefited earnings. But other than the benefit of cost absorption, everything else was pretty much in line with our expectations across the other elements of total delivered cost. Peter Grom : Great. Thanks so much. I\u2019ll pass it on. Kevin Jacobsen : Thanks, Peter. Operator : And we\u2019ll move next to Filippo Falorni with Citi. Filippo Falorni : Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to ask two questions on the businesses that you called out, Linda, the Glad and the Litter business. In Glad, it seems if you look at track channel data, it seems you\u2019ve recovered a lot of your shelf space with their introduction of the large pack sizes. So maybe you could give an update there. And in Litter, it seems like there\u2019s more opportunity to recover shelf space. Can you talk a little bit about the progress and your ability to convert consumers back to your brand after a period of shifting in calendar? Thank you. Linda Rendle : Sure. Thanks, Filippo. Just starting with Glad, we continue to make very good, strong progress on Glad, and it was one of the businesses that we talked about that would take a little bit longer to recover. But we made great progress in Q1. We returned to share growth. We grew seven-tenths of a share point in Q1 and you saw that accelerate as we moved through the quarter. We\u2019ve had very strong merchandising plans in place, including, I think we shared this last time, but Glad Trash was the number one consumable item on all of Amazon Prime Day. Performed very well and we\u2019re seeing merchandising across other retailers perform very well in addition. And that is a business where we have fully restored distribution and we\u2019re seeing that stick and hold as we come out of Q4 and into Q1. So I feel great about the trajectory on Glad. A little bit more work to do on share, but we feel like we\u2019re heading in the right direction and have the right plans from an innovation and demand building perspective. Litter, I\u2019m also pleased with the progress, but we have more work to do. We\u2019ve made some good progress on restoring our subscription business. So one of our leading retailers that uses subscriptions, we have restored over 90% of that subscription business that we lost. We\u2019ve also returned to the number one share position at that retailer with Fresh Step. So feel good that we\u2019re moving in the right direction in places where it\u2019s a little bit more difficult to get consumers back, given the nature of subscriptions. We also returned to share growth in Litter. So that business also grew seven-tenths of a share point in Q1. Again, accelerated throughout the quarter. We\u2019re seeing good merch support. Again, a bit higher than we would normally see pre-COVID, but feel it\u2019s warranted given what we\u2019re trying to recover and ensuring we get our consumers back and we\u2019d expect that to normalize over time as we get our share back. But again, Litter\u2019s one where it\u2019s just going to take a little bit longer. I\u2019m pleased with the progress. But I think if I look across all the businesses, that\u2019s the one that we just feel like is going to continue to linger on for a couple more quarters and we feel good about innovation that we have in the back half. We\u2019ll continue to invest strongly in advertising and sales promotion. And I would say we are on track with the plan that we have for this year and we\u2019ll continue to make progress in Q2, Q3 and Q4. Filippo Falorni : Great. That\u2019s very helpful. And then, Kevin, if I can ask one more on gross margin, given the outperformance in Q1, even if you account your guidance for Q2, it seems like you\u2019re going to be well ahead of your four-year target in the first half. So can you give us a sense of what are your expectations in the back half on gross margin? Kevin Jacobsen : Sure, Filippo. If you look at Q2, you probably saw our prepared remarks. We\u2019ve updated our expectations. We think gross margin will be down primarily due to the deleveraging of volume declining in the low-teens and so I expect Q2 to be down. And the expectation in the back half of the year and important for our exit rate is I\u2019d expect it to be sort of in that 44%, 44.5%, really what we\u2019re projecting for the full year. I don\u2019t expect it to be that different front half versus back half. So fairly consistent through the year and then exiting at a rate that would reflect a forward recovery of where we want to get to at the end of the year. Filippo Falorni : Great. Thank you. Super helpful. Operator : Our next question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, Operator, and good afternoon, everyone. I was hoping to see if you can talk about a little bit more on category consumption, Linda, because obviously there are puts and takes, and you\u2019re taking and you\u2019re recovering market share. But just thinking of the comments that you -- that we heard from you in a long time for value-seeking behaviors and how you\u2019re responding to it with RGM and different countbacks and all of that. And then as a follow-up to your comments, Kevin, on the cadence of margins in the second half. So should we think about like because it was lumpy last year, last fiscal year, with like a more pronounced margin in the fourth quarter. So thinking about how to model for the third quarter and the fourth quarter like a more balanced, given that it seems like your revenues will be more balanced as well, if you can help us with that. And in commodities, your commodities outlook has changed from what it was last quarter as you initially guided and now as you exit the first quarter? Linda Rendle : All right, Andrea, I\u2019ll start with your category and consumer question. The consumer environment is largely playing out as we had expected. We\u2019ve been talking about for the last several quarters that we expected the consumer to be under more stress broadly. And the impact on our categories was that we would move to low single-digit growth to low, low single-digit growth, which is about zero percent to 1% and that\u2019s exactly what we saw in Q1, right in line with our expectations. Some categories a bit higher than that, some a bit lower, but we got the average just about right. What we continue to see from the consumer is that value-seeking behavior. They\u2019re looking for ways to maximize their budget. They\u2019re buying larger sizes. They\u2019re buying smaller sizes to get a low out-of-pocket. They are looking for promotion. So the promotions that we\u2019ve put in place returning to those pre-COVID levels have worked well and we\u2019re seeing temporary price reductions work well with the consumer. Obviously, we\u2019re seeing retailers fighting for shoppers\u2019 wallets at this point. So you\u2019re seeing different tactics that are very normal across different channels and different retailers. We\u2019re seeing a shift of moving to more value-oriented channels for consumers. That continues. But I would say all of that is exactly in line with our expectations in aggregate. We expect that to continue for probably the balance of the year. These cycles usually run 12 months to 18 months. That\u2019s our best guess at this point of what the timing will look like if we look at history. But I think it\u2019s safe to say that there\u2019s an uncertain environment out there, particularly in the U.S., over the coming months. We\u2019ll see how that all plays out. But the good news is that for Q1, the consumer environment is exactly what we expected. And I think I\u2019ll just reiterate the point I made earlier on private label shares. What we\u2019re not seeing is trading down to private label in our categories. Private label shares are down versus pre-cyber levels this quarter in every one of our categories except two and that\u2019s wipes and salad dressing. And even for those, we\u2019re growing share in those categories. So it\u2019s coming -- private label growth is coming at expense of competitors. We\u2019re feeling very good. Our brands are resilient. The superior value we offer, the increase in advertising and sales promotion and trade promo are working. And we feel that we\u2019ve got the environment at this point right on and we\u2019re going to continue to execute our plan and intend to grow share in that environment. Kevin Jacobsen : And then, Andrea, on your questions on gross margin, maybe I\u2019ll start with the commodity view. And you\u2019ll recall when we came into the start of this year back in August, our expectation was we\u2019re operating at a fairly normalized level of cost inflation across the supply chain. We said about $75 million. And our view is that would be split fairly equally between commodities and inflation across the rest of the supply chain. We have made a fairly modest update for this outlook. I\u2019d say in commodities now, we think it\u2019s going to be just slightly better, still inflationary, but just a little bit less in place than we anticipated. So it won\u2019t have much meaningful impact on our full year expectations based on the update we\u2019ve made. And then I\u2019m phasing on gross margins. Our margins are actually in Q1. We delivered about 46%. I do expect our margins to be down in Q2 because of deleveraging, and we said, we\u2019d be down less than 100 basis points. So that\u2019ll probably put gross margins somewhere around that 43% range. And then the back half, well, we don\u2019t break it out by quarter. I continue to believe the back half will be sort of at that run rate, exit rate, somewhere around that 44%, 44.5%, kind of in line with the full year estimate. Andrea Teixeira : Perfect. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Anna Lizzul with Bank of America. Anna Lizzul : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks so much for the question. I just wanted to ask in light of your full year guidance and expectations on the consumer environment with the increased promotional spending, how should we think about pricing in order to drive volume growth as we move through the year? And also on advertising, you spent over 12% of sales in the U.S. retail business and is that a dynamic you expect to continue? Thanks. Linda Rendle : Hi, Anna. As it relates to pricing in particular, in the U.S., we have very little pricing outside of net revenue management and that really is what you\u2019ll see for the remainder of the year as well. We expect that program to continue to build, delivering value in fiscal year 2025, but building in fiscal year 2026 and beyond as we put that program in place. So this really is volume-based growth that we\u2019re seeing as we\u2019ve lapped those price increases. The other dynamic that we\u2019ve talked about that is a hit-to-price mix, of course, is trade promo, and we are seeing that play out. That impacted Q1, but was offset, of course, by some other factors on segment mix. But we would expect that to continue into Q2 and with less of a dynamic happening in the back half given the fact that that increased promotion started in Q3 of last year as we fully restored distribution. So this really will be about volume-based growth through innovation, through demand spending, through ensuring that we have the right value at the shelf for the consumer, and we continue to expect that our trade promotion expectations being around pre-COVID levels are about right. When it comes to advertising and sales promotion, we say about 11%, 11.5% at the aggregate level. We typically spend more in the U.S. than we do in International, so I would expect to see that dynamic continue to play out in the quarters to come. And of course, that varies by business depending on what\u2019s effective for each one of the business units and what we have going on in the quarter, whether that be innovation or a particular merchandising pulse period that matters for that business. But you would expect to see the U.S. run ahead of International as we move forward. Anna Lizzul : Okay. Thank you so much. Linda Rendle : Thanks, Anna. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Bonnie Herzog : All right. Thank you. Hi, everyone. I had a quick follow-up question on Litter. Linda, you mentioned you\u2019re promoting quite heavily, so I guess I\u2019d love to hear if you believe you\u2019re getting the appropriate lift on your promotional spend, and if not, do you have plans to modify your strategy in any way going forward? And then, I guess, how concerned are you overall that, you might be in a prisoner\u2019s dilemma right now in this category considering the elevated promo spend by everyone? Linda Rendle : Hi, Bonnie. Yeah. On Litter, this is a case where consumer behavior is a little bit different. We\u2019ve talked about in the past when you have a cat using Litter for a number of consumers, that\u2019s hard to change them. And so there\u2019s a bit more thinking about what we need to use the levers that we have in our toolbox, including trade promotion, to ensure that we remind them of why they love Fresh Step and that we were sorry to disappoint them while we were out of stock, but it\u2019s time to bring their cat back to the Litter they love. And so we think this is smart promotion. What we\u2019re not doing is anything that is incredibly deep discounting or outside of what we would think is right for our brand value. And as long as we don\u2019t do that, we\u2019re not communicating anything to the consumer that changes the value of our products, et cetera. So I feel very good that this is strategic promotion, that it\u2019s done in the right way. However, I would expect over time that that promotion will normalize and we are certainly seeing competitors also promote given what we\u2019ve had in the marketplace. But I think this just category is a little bit unique, and I don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re doing, again, anything outside of what we would normally do to gain share back in a category that way. I think moving forward, the great news about this category, which I think gets to your question on Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, I don\u2019t feel that at all. This category has natural tailwinds that many categories don\u2019t have. It grows faster than the average given the number of cats that are in the U.S. and in places around the world. In addition, it\u2019s a heavily innovation-driven category. And you can say this category has been reinvented many times by us and our competitors if you look at things like lightweight or different substrates. And so I have no fear that this is turning into that. I think what will get all of us out of this is great innovation, and we certainly are planning that for the back half and well beyond that, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see that from competitors as well. Bonnie Herzog : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then if I may, I just also wanted to get your perspective on any channel shifts or growth rates by channels. We\u2019ve heard that some of your peers have seen some weakness like channels, whether it be the consumer or just lower foot traffic. So, as I think about your lapping cyber tech, are there any specific channels that have shown weaker recovery? And I guess how has the performance maybe differed between tracked and untracked channels for you? Thank you. Linda Rendle : Sure. So on channel, we are not seeing anything specific to our recovery on cyber that\u2019s driving a change in consumer behavior, but we certainly are seeing a change in consumer behavior that\u2019s expected due to value seeking. So we see consumers moving to more value oriented channels. We see consumers shopping a bit more on deal and promotion and channels where that\u2019s really important. So a channel like that would be in grocery. And we are seeing consumers as they move to large sizes and small sizes go to channels where they can get those. So obviously for club, that business is very strong because that\u2019s where you can get the, you know, the largest size and the lowest price per use. So we would expect those dynamics to continue. They typically have in times when the consumer is more value stressed. And we tend to see more stock up trips, some more fill-ins as consumers are managing their wallet. But there\u2019s nothing unusual in what we\u2019re seeing. It\u2019s about in line with our expectations and nothing related to distribution or merchandising or any of our recovery from cyber. Bonnie Herzog : Okay. Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : And our next question will come from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Robert Moskow : Hi. Thanks for the question. I just want to make sure I understand the logic for the gross margin being at 43% for 2Q. I understand the deleveraging compared to last year, but is there something seasonal about gross margin, because if you\u2019re 45.8% in first quarter and then you dip down to 43% in second, I\u2019d like to know what causes that. I doubt it\u2019s the deleveraging. And then secondly, just on EPS, I mean you\u2019re beating consensus by like $0.50. You\u2019re only raising by about $0.10 or so. So did you beat your internal estimates by this much or by something less than that in first quarter? Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. Robert, happy to take those questions and gross margin, particularly around Q2. We do have a seasonal element to our business. Typically, in normalized years, Q2 would be our lowest gross margin quarter of the year and it\u2019s really driven by two primary factors. The first is we\u2019re now out of the Kingsford charcoal season. So Kingsford\u2019s a nice profitable business that we do about 50% of the business in Q4 and Q1, and Q2, then it\u2019s a low season for Kingsford, as well as it tends to be the period of time when our Burt\u2019s business, where we\u2019re doing quite a bit of holiday merchandising, which comes at a bit lower margin. So historically that\u2019s always been a lower margin quarter for us and this reflects that as well. Plus, the added impact of the deleveraging with the topline declining, as we said, double digits. And then on EPS, well, we don\u2019t disclose our internal forecast. This came in stronger than our internal forecast. There\u2019s a couple of things we were thinking about as we set the outlook for the year. And certainly the first one is, and I think you\u2019re going to appreciate this. We\u2019re only one quarter into the year and so we want to be thoughtful and not get ahead of ourselves for the full year. And having said that, that\u2019s, I think, always good counsel, but particularly this year, as we\u2019ve talked about a couple of areas we\u2019re watching pretty closely, which is the health of the U S consumer, as well as the promotional environment. Now, as Linda just said, Q1 played out very much like we expected, but that doesn\u2019t mean that that\u2019s going to continue. So that\u2019s something we\u2019re going to watch very closely. And then we had some tiny elements. So some of that over-delivery in Q1, as we mentioned, was based on pulling some shipments forward from Q2. So that won\u2019t have a full year impact. And then maybe just the last perspective I\u2019ll give you is, I think what I like is I think it gives us some financial flexibility and I think that\u2019s important. This is still a volatile macroeconomic environment and if the environment changes and it\u2019s different than what we think, we\u2019ve got some financial flexibility to address that. So I think that just builds our confidence and be able to deliver the year. But it\u2019s really how we approach the full year and as you know, we modestly took up the full year, but I think we\u2019re in a, we\u2019ve got the right plan for where we sit this early in the year. Robert Moskow : Got it. Thank you. Kevin Jacobsen : Thanks, Robert. Operator : And we\u2019ll move now to Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Olivia Tong : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Could you talk about your inventory positions at this point, whether at retail or if you have a view on consumer pantries, especially in Trash and Litter, given the level of trade spend in those businesses and how you think about consumption trends once the, once the promo is sort of normalized. And then just one follow-up on gross margin. If you could just talk about, how much of the overage was sort of ongoing price pack architecture work you\u2019re doing other revenue management, digital stuff that you\u2019ve been working on just to kind of think about what sort of the ongoing portion, as opposed to the fixed cost leverage/recovery from cyber portion of the gross margin overage? Thank you. Linda Rendle : Hi, Olivia. So on the inventory front, there\u2019s really no major things to call out here. We see pretty much normalized inventory in the retail environment. We\u2019re not seeing anything, where inventories are coming down or going up. We just see the normal things that happen at a retailer quarter end quarter beginning, but nothing material to call out. On the consumer front, I would say much of the same. We tend to watch our shipments and consumption pretty closely to see if there\u2019s any gaps. And at this point, there\u2019s nothing to talk about. The only thing I would call out is in, as we noted in our Professional business, we did see some shifting and cold and flu shipments into Q1 from Q2. But that\u2019s really just about retailers and distributors getting ready for season, and that\u2019s a pretty normal thing and we just anticipated it would be in Q2 and it happened in Q1 instead. But I wouldn\u2019t call it anything material, nor do we have plans for that and so if there are any adjustments by retailers, et cetera, we don\u2019t have plans for that in our forecast. Kevin Jacobsen : And then Olivia, on your gross margin question, I think that the nature of the question is what portion of the strong performance in Q1 is structural. I would certainly point to our cost savings and I think you can see in our web attachments we deliver about 240 basis points of improvement to gross margin in Q1 from cost savings. We\u2019re on track to have another very good year this year. I think as you know, we target 175 basis points of EBIT margin expansion each year, but because of the very good work by the team over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve delivered over 200 basis points each year and I believe we\u2019re on track to do that again this year. So certainly the cost savings element will continue. The other item though, we\u2019ve talked a bit about back in August was the benefit of the two recent divestitures. They are both margin dilutive to the company. So by divesting those businesses, they will structurally improve our margins 50 basis points to 70 basis points on average and so we\u2019re starting to see the benefit of that in Q1. Again, we didn\u2019t get the full benefit because we sold the VMS business in the middle of the quarter, but you\u2019ll start to see more of that playing out as we move into Q2 and beyond. Olivia Tong : Got it. Thanks. And then just one follow-up, the 20% of the business that\u2019s growing at the mid-single-digit rate, like PPD, what\u2019s driving that? Because if I remember correctly, the comps are particularly demanding. So maybe that\u2019s a piece of it, because I can\u2019t imagine that the demand is really changing all that materially in PPD? Thank you. Linda Rendle : Sure. So we talked about both PPD and our International business growing at that mid-single-digit rate and we feel strongly that there\u2019ll be a better contributors moving forward. International, I think we\u2019ve spoken a lot about as we\u2019ve reduced the volatility of that business, removed a lot of the FX headwinds that we had experienced coming out of Argentina. We see more stability and ability to grow in different parts of the world and that continues. And we feel even stronger about that now that we have divested the Argentina business. From a PPD perspective, we got to a place that was up and down during COVID, we\u2019ve seen that normalize. This is not a result of a lot of people coming back to the office as one might expect, but what we\u2019ve talked about in the past, which is we have so much opportunity across our portfolio with innovation, different places that we don\u2019t play in today. The industry is pretty favorable right now, as we see consolidation in healthcare and we\u2019re able to work with those systems to ensure that they have the right cleaning and disinfecting products to protect their workers and to protect patients. So we see continued upside in that business and we feel confident in its ability to deliver above average -- above company, average growth moving forward and certainly we\u2019re seeing evidence of that in Q1. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Kevin Grundy with BNP Paribas. And Mr. Grundy, your line is open. Mr. Grundy, could you check to see if your mute button is engaged, please? Okay. Hearing no response. We\u2019ll move to our next question. That will come from Kaumil Gajrawala. Kaumil Gajrawala : It\u2019s been a big piece of conversation sort of in the past, but not as much today. And maybe just the learning so far on the turning on Canada and perhaps, what the timeline is for the U.S. Linda Rendle : Hey, Kaumil, do you mind repeating your question? The first part was cut off. Kaumil Gajrawala : No problem. I was asking about ERP and what you\u2019ve learned so far from Canada and what the timeline looks like for the U.S. Linda Rendle : Sure. We spoke about just briefly last time that we implemented the ERP in Canada at the end and beginning of this -- end of last fiscal year, beginning of this fiscal year and it went very well. The team had done a lot of preparation as our lead market to ensure that that execution went as smoothly as possible and it did. We didn\u2019t have any customers experience any significant disruptions, and in fact, many of them noted they didn\u2019t even really remember that it was going on, which is actually exactly what you want from your retailers when you\u2019re doing an ERP transition. That being said, the U.S. business will come next and that is much more complex with a lot more ship points, a lot more businesses. So the team is taking the learnings that we had from that Canadian implementation and building our implementation plan for the U.S. right now. We would expect that that would begin at the end of this fiscal year. We\u2019re still working through what the exact timing will look like and how we will phase that because it won\u2019t all happen at once and we\u2019ll be able to report at our Q2 earnings release a little bit more detail on how we expect that to play out and any potential impacts, but feel very good about what we did in Canada, giving us a lot of confidence heading into a very complex U.S. implementation. Kaumil Gajrawala : Okay. Great. And then on Litter, when you\u2019re -- as you\u2019re thinking about how to get the consumer to come back, promos is a piece of it, but I suppose marketing is also quite a large piece of it. So can we just talk about what specifically you\u2019re doing to try to get that consumer to switch back to where they were or maybe even bringing in new consumers? Linda Rendle : Yes. Absolutely. You\u2019re right that trade promotion is only a part of what we are doing and clearly reminding people about the benefits of the products that we have and why they\u2019ve always loved or maybe why they should be introduced to your point for the first time to Fresh Step or Scoop Away or any of our other Litter brands is top of mind. And with that, we put new advertising in place in July for our Fresh Step business, which we think is doing pretty well and contributing to the share of results that we saw in Q1. We\u2019re continuing to ensure that we have the right claims and ensure that we have the right price pack architecture and Litter. So we\u2019re taking steps. We\u2019re doing what we can in the short-term, which really is through increased advertising, better advertising messaging, using digital, which can allow us to do kind of claims real time to ensure that we\u2019re communicating with those consumers. And obviously at the subscription level, we can have more of a one-on-one conversation with them and engage with them on reminding them that Fresh Step is the brand that they know and love and that\u2019s worked pretty well. Moving forward as we\u2019re thinking about innovation, we\u2019re looking at all of the levers that you would expect us to pull. What are the next sets of innovation that we can launch that delight them? How can we ensure that we\u2019re communicating superior value overall for our proposition and how they shop for it, the product, the package, the brand communication, and so we are taking under advisement that entire ecosystem right now to say, do we really feel great about the plans that we have in place and we\u2019ve done a lot to already improve those given what we faced? But I feel good about the plan that we put in place over the last couple of quarters. It\u2019s clearly beginning to work, but more to come as we sequence through the remainder of the year. Kaumil Gajrawala : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. You would talk about the sources of surprise in the quarter on topline and that pull-forward and timing on Professional products. But I think in the prepared remarks, you also mentioned International. So I\u2019m curious if you could just elaborate a little bit on kind of what went better than expected on International and that sounded less like it\u2019s timing and more like it\u2019s better trend. So I\u2019d love to hear more about that. Thanks. Linda Rendle : Yeah. Overall International just performed well, and certainly, we\u2019re seeing the impacts of removing Argentina. We\u2019re also seeing some strength in pockets around the world, but I would say, International wasn\u2019t wildly outside of our expectations. It was a bit better and it\u2019s just all things coming together as we put innovation in the market that\u2019s working, our consumer plans are working, and we\u2019re seeing some stability now that we\u2019ve removed the majority of the FX headwinds that we had due to Argentina. But I would just say it\u2019s good execution of the fundamentals. Nothing of major surprise one way or the other, just everything went a little better. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : And we\u2019ll move next to Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Chris Carey : Hi everyone. Linda Rendle : Hi, Chris. Chris Carey : So I have a question about pricing in the quarter and into really, I guess, the back half of the year. So if I look at the segment disclosures, pricing\u2019s flat and Health and Wellness price mix that is down 5 and Household down 8 and Lifestyle. And yet in a prepared remarks it\u2019s plus 1. There\u2019s like a positive pricing dynamic and International, which I don\u2019t think I fully understand. Given the 11% organic is driven by 11% volume growth. So I don\u2019t know if you can maybe just help me bridge that gap and really what I\u2019m trying to understand is if the underlying U.S. business is kind of running price mix down low-single digits right now. Is that the expectation for the U.S. business going into the back half of the year? I guess, I\u2019m trying to understand if the volume is going to be over and above that to get to this 3 to 5 or if I\u2019m just misunderstanding something, I fully realize it kind of a tactical on Litter and you were probably quite tactical on promotional activity to recapture sales growth in Q1. But I am just, so anyway, I am trying to close the logic gap on the couple of these things. Any perspective would help? Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah, Chris. This is Kevin. I can certainly answer that one and I agree, it\u2019s a bit challenging to read the performance right now given the cyber lap. So maybe I can separate what\u2019s happening because of cyber versus underlying business. If you looked last year in Q1, we had very significant favorable price mix and what you\u2019re seeing is most of that\u2019s just reversing out. That\u2019s strictly noise of the lap in cyber. And I\u2019ll just give you a little flavor for why that happened. I\u2019ll give you an example. If you looked at our Lifestyle segment last year, you\u2019d see about 9 points of favorable price mix. The reason that occurred is, when you think about the business in Lifestyle, our Brita, our Food and our Burt\u2019s Bees business, Burt\u2019s Bees declined at a faster rate than our other businesses. That business is what we call LTL or less than full truckload. It had a much more negative impact as a result of the cyber event and we generate less revenue per case in that business. And so you got what appeared to be a nice price mix last year, because you just sold a lot less Burt\u2019s than the other businesses that now reverses out this year that -- our Burt\u2019s business grew almost twice the rate of Food and Beverage are just getting back to a normal normalized level. That\u2019s really all noise of lapping the cyber event. What I\u2019d tell you is structural within price mix. If you think of that plus 1, what is structural and unrelated to lap is we had about 1 point of negative trade spending very much in line with what we\u2019ve been talking about. We\u2019re returning to a more normalized promotional environment. We expected trade spending to be up, particularly because we\u2019re lapping the cyber event. So there\u2019s 1 point of negative trade spending and that was more than offset by 2 points of favorable mix and that mix was a little bit what Linda was talking about, particularly in our U.S. cleaning business. We saw some favorable mix at the skew level. And so that was a benefit to the quarter that we did not anticipate that helped with the over delivering Q1. And that was really that, that\u2019s how you get to that 1-point overall price mix. So you really have to take away a lot of the noise of the lap and just get down to kind of the fundamental elements that are part of the ongoing business. But let me stop there and see if that answers your question. Chris Carey : Yeah. That\u2019s a -- so as you get through that lap dynamic into the back half of the year, this will start to go away. I\u2019m still confused, and look, I can take this offline. Maybe this isn\u2019t the forum, but you had 11% organic sales growth in International driven by 11 points of volume. So what\u2019s the 4% price mix that\u2019s offsetting that. And again, I realize this is kind of a modeling question and I can take it offline. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. Chris Carey : But if there\u2019s any context there, that would be\u2026 Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. I\u2019ll give you the quick answer and then you can follow up at least, but that\u2019s the structural benefit of that divestiture, the Argentina business, it shows up in mix now. And after a year, that\u2019ll just be part of the base business, but it shows up in mix when you, the first year, you don\u2019t have that lower revenue per case business in your portfolio. And then in terms of the phasing, as we said, we expect trade to be unfavorable in the front half of the year because we\u2019re lapping on an unusually low level promotion last year during cyber. And we were back to a normalized level promotional activity in the back half of last year. So when you get to the back half, we don\u2019t expect to see negative trade spending. That\u2019s really a front half issue as we\u2019re lapping cyber. Chris Carey : It\u2019s really helpful. Thanks for explaining that, Kevin. Thanks a lot. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. You bet. But if I didn\u2019t get you all the way there, feel free to follow up with Lisah afterwards. Operator : And our next question will come from Javier Escalante with Evercore ISI. Javier Escalante : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I have a question when it comes -- if you can remind us what is the underlying category growth that you\u2019re assuming for, which is equivalent to the 3% to 5% organic sales growth that you are targeting for 2025? And I have a follow up. Linda Rendle : Sure, Javier. We had said that was low-single digits. So we said zero percent to 1% and we were within that range for Q1. Javier Escalante : And if you -- we both used our Canada data [ph] and you see that there was a spike, at least it seems as if in October and it coincided with the hurricanes down in the Southeast. So when you mentioned that your quarter was above expectations and it was strong, is there is any possibility that basically at the time that you merchandise very strongly and at the time you have the surge of impulse purchases because of the storm and somehow you are -- your -- the promotional lift was stronger than otherwise would have been. Is that a possibility or not necessarily a factor? Linda Rendle : We\u2019re not seeing that as a factor, Javier. We have pretty good analytics given hurricanes unfortunately happen pretty often nowadays in the U.S. And so we don\u2019t see the hurricane having any meaningful impact in the course of time. It can, if it splits a quarter, but if we don\u2019t see that at this point, we don\u2019t see significant pantry loading and we don\u2019t see any impact as we think about the Q1 versus Q2 dynamic. What I would note is, I would also be very careful looking at short time periods, looking at anything in October. We have merchandising, there\u2019s different timing shifts, there\u2019s different laps and so we try to take a little bit of a longer view, but we still feel very comfortable that the zero percent to 1% range is right for the year. Again, though, we\u2019ll watch the consumer, we\u2019ll watch the pricing dynamic in the U.S. to see if there\u2019s any adjustments we need to make or if there\u2019s any changes there. But for now we still see zero percent to 1% is the right range. Javier Escalante : So by the high level, then Linda, you basically said that again, the business is strong above expectations. So if it is not that externality, could you tell me kind of like the one or two things that you believe pan out better than you expected? Linda Rendle : If you look at just overall, our portfolio Health and Wellness came in stronger and that was, we saw very strong share growth in our Home Care and Laundry business. We actually picked up significant share in our Bleach business. PPD came in very strong as you saw and we talked about, we think there\u2019s real tailwinds to that business. So what I would talk about is, the strong demand plans that we have in place, the advertising and trade promotion is working very well. Consumers are coming back to our brands because we\u2019re offering them superior value. It\u2019s really good execution of the fundamentals and that\u2019s what\u2019s delivering the strength. And then, of course, PPD was a bit of a surprise. Some of it great. And overall, we see PPD performing better, but some of it was a shift between Q1 and Q2. Javier Escalante : Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Thank you very much. Two questions, one for each of you, if I could. The first one, Linda, just perspective, as you think about the progress you\u2019re seeing in market, just perspective on the Household penetration metric that you guys track, how that\u2019s progressing, how you think it plays out over the balance of the year. And then perhaps related Kevin for you is the 3% to 5% growth that you referenced in a roundabout in the second half, I guess, can you talk a little bit about how you think that compares to consumption? Is it in line or do you think that you\u2019ll be continuing to gain points of distribution or ship ahead of SAP with any materiality as you exit the year, just trying to frame that 3% to 5% relative to what your expectations are on consumption? Thank you. Linda Rendle : Sure, Steve. Starting with Household penetration, that is something that we monitor closely, and obviously it\u2019s a metric that we look at over the long-term to say, are the health of our businesses on track? Are we bringing new consumers in and are we retaining them? We certainly expected a trade-off when we took four rounds of pricing in Household penetration and we saw that, but it wasn\u2019t unique to us. It was true for our categories. We had consumers change behavior as they reacted to pricing, but the good news is as we expected, we\u2019re starting to see that trend reverse and that showing up in the volume based growth that we\u2019re experiencing right now. And we would expect over time as we bring consumers new innovation, as we continue to invest strongly in advertising and sales promotion, that will bring those consumers back in and Household penetration will begin to grow again and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. But we would expect to be at about this point. Then you throw in the noise of a cyber-disruption where we were out of stock for a period of time and that puts some noise in the data as well. But I would say the fact that it has turned and we\u2019ve reversed that trend is the right place to be and we\u2019re focused on growing it from here and doing all the things that we know how to do with a focus on if we have superior value experiences for people, that\u2019s how we grow Household penetration. We want to grow categories and we want to grow share within those categories. So I\u2019d say on track, but more work to do and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re all focused on from a category perspective. During a time when the consumer is seeking value, we\u2019re focusing more on things like trade promotion and other things than we would normally do. But we\u2019re also ensuring that we\u2019re doing the good long-term things that bring consumers into categories and retain them. Kevin Jacobsen : And then Steve on the back half that 3% to 5% are kind of growing in line with our algorithm. We don\u2019t -- we believe that\u2019s in line with consumption. We\u2019re not assuming we\u2019re shipping above consumption. We have not built in any impacts for SAP. I think you mentioned that. So that\u2019s, as Linda said, we\u2019ll come back in February and make any adjustments we think are appropriate as it relates to the impact of SAP. So this really just relates to all the building blocks we talked about, modest category growth in the U.S., good strong performance and that portion of our portfolio outside the U.S. Clorox Professional, International, as well as the benefits of that divestitures of the two businesses. Those are really the building blocks and that really the expectations it\u2019s in line with consumption. Steve Powers : Great. Very clear. Thank you both. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. Thanks Steve. Operator : And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with BNP Paribas. Kevin Grundy : Hey. Good afternoon. Sorry before my line dropped off. And anyway, thank you for taking the question. I will be quick because we\u2019ve covered it -- covered a ton of ground. There\u2019s an election next week and just in the way of housekeeping. Kevin, can you just remind us what portion of the business, this is sort of a broader question would potentially be at risk if there were sort of broader tariffs that came back into play. So maybe just a question around sourcing outside of the U.S. would be helpful? Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. Kevin, I can tell you, I won\u2019t go into too many specifics here, but we\u2019ve done quite a bit of work. If you obviously remember all the supply chain disruptions we had a number of years ago\u2026 Kevin Grundy : Yeah. Yeah. Kevin Jacobsen : \u2026 as a result of that and I think we not just Clorox, but many companies realized we were more vulnerable than we anticipated. We\u2019ve been doing quite a bit of work to, I\u2019d say, near shore and onshore production to move it much closer to our consumer. And so over the last number of years, you may know we\u2019ve expanded Wipes capacity in the U.S. We\u2019ve stood up contract manufacturers in Europe and Asia for businesses in those markets. And so we\u2019ve done quite a bit of work to reduce our risk of these long supply chains. I certainly -- I think that certainly benefits us. And as you know we have a broad network of suppliers. And so I won\u2019t go into too many specifics, but certainly something we\u2019re aware of something our team has been very focused on to make sure that we\u2019ve got access to product and we can manage effectively. And so we don\u2019t see this as having any major disruptions on a business at this point. And I think we all have to wait and see exactly how this plays out. There\u2019s a lot of discussions going on, but I don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves and start speculating on what may play out. I want to see how this actually turns in any types of legislation and so right now though, it\u2019s something we\u2019re looking at and we\u2019re very focused on making sure we\u2019re prepared for any eventualities. But beyond that, it\u2019s nothing that we\u2019ve baked in specifically into this outlook. Kevin Grundy : Totally fair. Just to box it in maybe a little bit more understanding. We\u2019re in a realm of a lot of, I\u2019m going to ask you an uncertain question on top of an uncertain outcome, but what portion\u2026 Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. Kevin Grundy : \u2026 of the company\u2019s cost of goods are currently sourced from outside the U.S. let me ask it that way. Kevin Jacobsen : We don\u2019t break that out to you. So that our Kevin, that\u2019s not something we provided publicly. We have a broad network of suppliers all over the world, but we don\u2019t break out how much comes from outside the U.S. versus inside the U.S. Kevin Grundy : Okay. Very good. All right. Thank you. Congrats on the quarter. Kevin Jacobsen : Yeah. Thanks Kevin. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. Ms. Rendle, I will now turn the conference back to you. Linda Rendle : Thanks Jen. As we close today\u2019s call, I want to stress three areas. First, we have made strong progress against our commitments. Second, our brands are strong and we continue to invest in them to deliver superior experiences for consumers. And finally, our team is taking the right steps to accelerate growth and transform for the future. We\u2019re building a stronger company, poised to deliver more consistent profitable growth and enhance long-term shareholder value. Thank you for your time and for your questions. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress in February. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for attending.",
